Our JobKeeper scheme during covid paid money directly to employers to cover the cost of their employees, this money had to be paid by the employers to their employees, but in most cases they would have paid their employees that much money anyway, so in effect, we printed a lot of money and gave it to Australia's most wealthy companies (the ones with lots of employees).
I bought heaps of shit I didn't need this week.
Just like everyone else.
So, there's the impact of getting the resources to make it, making it, shipping it and deposing of it.
No matter what it is.
My bad its 5% also yes a certain amount of people are paid above the avr wage of the state ($50,000) but the impact the companies leave via ground water contamination, open pit mining, deteriorating air quality, and old mines being left, extraction of materials that cannot regrow or come back.
They are not paying their fair share for polluting and extracting.
No, capitalism isn't broken.
It works just fine.
You think conditions in this country and this time period are bad?
Go look around at other countries and time periods.
Working a shit job today is basically heaven compared to what it used to be.
I agree it could get much, much better., But capitalism isn't broken.
What a ridiculous notion.
People like you have been saying that since capitalism started.
So far, every single one of them has been wrong.
And I suggest you are, too.
Man the mining companies must've seen that my stuff was getting traction and sent out the trolls, the state actually limited to 5% in our constitution that was written in the 18 century also there is plenty of evidence of mine spill over into aquifers in Nevada not just from mining hard rock but also from things such as plutonium and Deuterium water.
Also you were correct the change was for silver and gold but not for a new mining hardon called lithium.
Also its only for companies that make over 200 million in a year and there are some companies that can file for an exemption.
