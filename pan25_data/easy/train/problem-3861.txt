Abandoning Ukraine does not mean the war ends.
Russia is unable to control Ukraine.
The Ukrainians have shown they will not surrender to Russian imperialism, so if we abandon Ukraine, it just means that the conflict will drag on into a guerrilla war.
The only way the war ends is if Putin comes to his senses or if the Ukrainians win so decisively that Putin can't fight on anymore.
So the best thing we can do to end the war is to hasten Ukrainian victory.

The article doesn’t follow journalism integrity.
It’s anonymous with no name attached to it… the same type of articles you’d find in UFO publications.
Any ceasefire right now disproportionately benefits Russia.
It's also extremely unlikely that with the current state of things, Russia would depart Crimea, returning it to Ukraine.
Editorial is just conjectural mind-vomit.
Don’t you remember how many anonymous “editorials” there were about “Covid being a Plandemic” and “the vaccine will change our DNA / kill more people” we went through a couple years ago?
