Obviously where it goes too far is the far-left ideal of dragging all wealthy people out into the street, taking all their money and then rendering them either homeless or dead.
That's how you end up with a reign of terror where people don't know where to stop, and the entire community devolves into mindless revenge for perceived slights.
But would it really be such an unfair thing to be reduced to comfortable upper class living?

A strong currency might be good for an individual living in a country but not necessarily for the country as a whole as it completely screws over the import market and any tourism.

Hey buddy.
Just a heads up, next time you try to cosplay as a non-Russian online to defend russias illegal and immoral invasion of a sovereign nation, just say "Ukraine.

Then you must analyze the psychology of someone willing to exploit others' labor hours to make such a profit (do not believe for one moment they are not fully aware of what their astronomical money totals mean for other human beings, who they have no compassion for) and decide if you wish to feel compassion for that person losing a fraction of their total banked labor hours.
And since they are still living a comfortable life based on exploitation, and their money is ill-gotten to begin with... Nah, you do not need to feel compassion for an investor losing money.
They still have more than you.
