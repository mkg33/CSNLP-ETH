ie Rogue terror action (this man attacks Kurds with sword) results in protests.
The police brutally suppress the protestors with mass arrests, the use of 'less than lethal munitions' and general brutality.
The now crushed protest leaves the streets and goes underground.
A group of Kurds who believe the state is now complicit with the rogue terrorist due to the way the state 'sided' with the rogue (the enemy of my enemy) and decide to obtain justice outside the law as the law is corrupt and commit a terrorist action against the rogue terrorists group(remember that until now this is in reaction to a rogue and not a faction).
The group recently aggrieved takes to the streets to protest the reactionary act of terror, the police brutally suppress them, they go underground, a small group decides the state is now complicit with the rogue terrorist group due to the way they 'sided' with the rogue group and obtain justice outside the law as the law is corrupt and they commit a terrorist action against the rogue groups group (say the rogue group is Kurdish and 5 Kurds attacked a church so members from that church go and find a completely unrelated Kurdish church to destroy).

Perhaps it would give them some.
perspective.
I mean they protested and attacked the people showing up to access the situation.
Not a good look for them.
