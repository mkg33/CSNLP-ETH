Far worse?
Not for my immigrant family and friends who have experience in both Europe and the US.
You have warped view of reality.
The US, like every single country has its share of issues, but I'd argue that it integrates its immigrants far better than most countries including those in Europe.
It's a multicultural nation of immigrants with the largest economy with far more opportunities than almost anywhere else.
It constantly ranks among the very top of countries that people want to immigrate to.
I don't even know why anyone would even bring up repressive gulf states in the same context.
Like, yeah, being very wealthy means you'll do well anywhere (including authoritarian hell holes, but why even bring those up?).
Bizarre.
If you want to get rid of the illegal immigration the best solution is to be incredibly harsh drugs(or legalize them freely but that's also a terrible idea) and ban avocados (yeah the cartels that run drugs have avocados as a backup industry there attempting to diversify and become more like the Italian mafia).
