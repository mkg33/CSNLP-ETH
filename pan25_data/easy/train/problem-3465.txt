Useless pedantry.
You thought the illegal loggers were murdering people for reasons other than the illegal logging or something?
What point are you even trying to make?
Enjoy extinction.
From what I've seen, it's a fog of nightmares that settles in and leaves nothing but parasites and decomp behind.
Silence except for the chewing of termites, all so we could play Jetsons for a human lifetime.
Nice job.
I can't speak for deathsquads but typically for "enforcement" not only are they at risk everyday to protect you, they're also subject to prosecution post-event following investigation, so I disagree again as this is not some lawless wild west cowboy sherif (though it could certainly apply to some countries, but as reasonable human beings we'd expect that there would be some policy in place).
I can't.
not anymore.
I dont belong on this side of your fenced in chemical orgy.
I dont even care if I'm blamed by the people for coming from this nightmare factory, I just cant do this anymore.
When you come to a point where you don't believe in the direction and aims of your country, what do you do?
Where do you go?
I'm not fighting anyone but I am happy to be a human shield against the mindless violence my people inflict on the world as if they're doing it a favour.
