I was in a medieval LARP event and I was facing off against the guy that everyone knew was the best there but he had a sword and I had a spear and...
I lied, it was Star Wars...
It was a Star Wars LARP not medieval, I was hoping I could make this make sense without revealing just how nerdy this was...
Anyway.
I had a light saber spear (it wasn't a canon LARP) and he had a sword.
All he needed to do was hit my massive hilt to destroy my weapon and win (or stab me).
So I actively made short lunges trying to make it look like it was the max range.
After multiple short jabs, he figured out my maximum range and began dodging to just outside that range.
The second I could tell he was confident, I snapped out the extra foot of range and stabbed him right in the gut.
He was still better than me but I won that fight.
Historically these moments of high volatility are where autocratic states fundamentally misjudge democracies, figuring they're waffling and weak, not realizing that an external threat is sometimes the only influence that will cause democracies to work together.
