Correct.
If you take the standard deduction, since you didn't take the SALT deduction, refunds aren't taxable.
If I pay my state an extra $5k that I don't owe, I get to deduct that from my income for federal taxes (called the SALT deduction which only exists if you itemize).
I then file my state return and get all that money back "tax free."
Now next year, I have to declare that refund as income because that money wasn't taxed before (the deduction).
The real question here (and why the IRS needs to provide guidance) is if these payments are tax refunds or some other kind of income.
I think the IRS will side with the states and call it a refund, so people who itemized their deductions will need to pay taxes on it.
State and local tax refunds are taxable because the tax paid was deductable from federal income in the year it was paid.
If this isn't a refund, but just a payment (like the Alaska Permanent Fund), it is taxed normally.
Just because it came from a state doesn't change the fact that it is income.
Once again, that income was never previously taxed.
