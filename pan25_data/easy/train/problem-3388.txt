So, India wasn't dependent on Russia oil.
Just wait after a few months, quarters, or years.
The longer it goes on the worse it will be for India.
Regardless who wins the war (certainly the West which Ukraine is becoming a part of) Russian oil will eventually be free of sanctions.
That re-normalization of prices will almost certainly be a shock.
That's where it will feel like a dependence because India will be used to the lower cost.
This will be hard.
There is a material & very significant fundamental difference, the dislocation cost of such a reconfiguration of energy imports given its societal impact & economic impact falls very much harder on states like India, which has a average per capita GDP of USD$2,500 as compared with much better off states with per capita GDP of say USD$34,000+.
Great.
Reuters just published an article saying the opportunity to purchase cheap oil from Russia saved India $500 million in January alone.
You are too thick to get it.
It is treachery to the concepts of sovereignty, democracy, human rights and mass murder of civilians.
India stands only for raw capitalism and bloody fascism at this point.
