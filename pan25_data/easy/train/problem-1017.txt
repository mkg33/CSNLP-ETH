I suppose that it is quite possible for the police to be working with the parliament and the party in their investigations.
But to me, it just seemed too quick for the party and Parliament to have actually investigated the charges themselves.
Also also, “capitalism” is barely an ideology.
It basically just describes free market economy.
And capitalism is not the amazing freedom-bringing thing that I blatantly assume you think it is.
Have you ever played monopoly?
A real capitalist seeks to maximize his profit.
If left completely unchecked, that leaves a tiny economic “elite” who own everything and exploits their workforce to the absolute maximum.
That’s why even a ‘capitalist’ country like the USA has so many policies that can be called socialist - social security, medicare/medicaid, unemployment, public schools etc.
One of the country’s greatest technological achievements - landing a man on the moon - had to be initiated and paid for by the government.
It’s similar with many great tech things.
