India has preached to the West about the wrongs of colonialism and imperialism for decades - its words have proven to be hollow, and its values empty.
You condemn the West to have profited from imperial wars in the past, but say that India should not be condemned for profiting (if it really is, that is) from an imperial war today.
You criticise Western nations for having engaged in imperial wars in the past, but refuse to hold Russia accountable for its engaging in an imperial war today.
Your hypocrisy is worse than that which you implicitly allege of citizens in the West: we recognise that our past imperial wars were, and Russia's current imperial war is, wrong.
Wow.
You do know words can be used as nouns and adjectives?
You might wanna read up on the word brute.
This is coming for from evidently an uneducated, weak Indian.
Lol.
Indian foreign policy has consistently condemned the West in the past for its history of imperial wars and colonialism, but remains conspicuously silent when Russia engages in imperial wars and colonialism.
