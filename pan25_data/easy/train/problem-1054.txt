SCOPE-Money buys time and not just because of expensive lawyers.
If you or I get charged with, let’s say bank fraud for cashing bad checks.
Lets say it was a lot, like 100k over a year period with 200 checks over 17 different banks.
It may take 6 months for the DA to have each and every check counted, were the money went (is the car you bought legal or did a cashed check pay for part of it?
), who else benefited?
Was your spouse involved?
Any employees at the bank?
You got caught for 100k but did you do more?
Lots of work right?
Now put that into billions of dollars with hundreds of thousands of checks spanned over hundreds of banks.
That would take years of investigating.
Btw, if any part of the years long investigation is done illegally (chain of custody, false confession, new guy goes into an apt.
he shouldn’t without a warrant) the investigation is set back a year.
Abso-goddamn-lutely.
Those shit-heads would never have attacked the Capitol without the explicit direction from charlatan Pres.
Trump and his fascist junta.
Mueller wasn't investigating for impeachment.
He was investigating for criminal acts.
Turned out he was wearing very strict legal blinders along the way.
And likely past his time as an investigator.
Whatever.
I just hope that the Biden crime family gets their day in court over Hunter's laptop, how the big guy Joe profited over it illegally and the Twittergate election stealing crimes.
