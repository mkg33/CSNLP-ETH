You need an entire logistics and maintenance infrastructure and those need training.
All of that takes time.
Not to mention that the Russians moved their tanks in groups like it was Parade Day in Moscow making them easy targets for Ukrainians, meanwhile during the initial invasion Ukraine had their tanks disperse and for example in Chernihiv despite being outnumbered 10 to 1 in tanks the Ukrainians inflicted heavy damage on the Russians to the the point the Russians ended up bypassing the city until their eventual retreat.
It.
Takes.
Time.
You guys keep acting like an Abrams is a Honda Civic that you can just give to someone and drive it 200k miles.
Exactly.
I'm willing to bet Ukrainians are currently all over NATO training on Leopards, Abrams, F15/16, Apaches, and whatnot.
Every new technology needs time to be learned by the operators, assimilated into their logistics, and integrated into their fighting force.
That's why the first western supplies were idiot-proof ATGMs and MANPADs, progressed to simple tube artillery and eventually HIMARS, then advancing to AFVs today.
I'm even sure more advanced equipment will be delivered once all the necessary groundwork is laid.
Remember that what killed Russia's initial momentum was not a lack of technology, but their insufficient logistics.
