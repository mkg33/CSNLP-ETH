All the licensing restrictions do is funnel money into the pockets of a few buddies of the people who have licensing oversight (which is exactly what has happened next door in Arkansas).
No.
Almost every single one of those “tests” you are speaking about are bullshit, bought and paid for.
Nothing more.
I have news for you, the 38% THC herb you think you purchased is not 38%.
Almost every point you attempt make is propaganda bs shilled by corporate stooges.
It’s ether treat herb like tomato’s with decriminalizing, or equality and equity through abundance.
This or the black market goes no where ever.
Dont get me wrong, I’m a giant advocate for legalization, however Oklahoma has ridiculously low standards for people who want to start their own marijuana businesses and that drives prices that companies can charge to levels that are not sustainable for operating a profitable business.
There’s something to be said about having a bar of entry high enough to keep prices at a competitive level.
You have to also consider how much of the legal marijuana that is grown in OK will hit the black market in other states(see Oregon).
From my understanding OK has a horrible tracking system for their industry and many growers simply sell their products on the black market.
