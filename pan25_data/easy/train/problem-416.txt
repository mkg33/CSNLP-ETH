Don't get me wrong, in the next 10 to 20 years, the US is going to have to make a hard choice about Taiwan, but we aren't there... yet.
Further, I doubt it is going to come to a full military intervention because Taiwan is half way across the globe and... frankly... we are building the key industries that Taiwan has over here.
In ten years, China is going to be strong enough to look at the US and tell us that they are taking Taiwan, and we are going to grudgingly hand it over after some concessions.
Or we are going to massively (and I mean massively) step up the defensive posture for Taiwan.
If people are bucking at what is spent in Ukraine... the amount spent in Taiwan is going to give them all aneurisms.
Not necessarily.
At no point would the conflict be existential for either side unless the US wins so decisively that it decides to invade China itself (which would be a stupid thing to do and I don’t see happening).
In particular, it won’t be nuclear.
Nor is Earth over if the conflict becomes nuclear.
At most some tens of millions in the US and hundreds of millions in China, but there’s no reason for others to get involved, and certainly Earth and humanity in the long term will be fine.
