When we went in 2021, we had to take PCR tests 24 hours before boarding, another test at the airport at landing, wait for one hour to get results (if we had been positive we would have been transferred to a public isolation room or hospital if we had symptoms), we were then given a bracelet that we had to wear during quarantine and we had to go to a special quarantine hotel that cost a fortune for 21 days and which we couldn’t exit at any time for the full duration (with the GPS linked bracelets as verification).
And we had several more tests to take while we were there, I can’t recall exactly, but something like days 5,8,14,21.
Seriously?
It was a popular theory that COVID accidentally made its way out of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a lab that happens to study coronaviruses which is located in the ground zero town of Wuhan, where COVID started.
Yeah.
And remember how they reported some insanely low number of people infected?
Countries around the world are reporting hundreds of thousands of people, if not millions.
China: 10.
Ridiculous!
Thank you for that more in depth information.
I had read a little bit here and there, mostly about the vibe that it was kinda like the CCP juse kinda decided that they were going to defeat Covid, sorry Covid, we're China, step aside or something like you said, without changing approaches to defend against it as it itself changed.
