Once again, really grateful to serving with incredible legislators who have done a lot of work to protect reproductive rights Before I was sworn in, an omnibus bill re: reproductive rights and gender affirming care that protects health care providers and their patients from legal attacks by neighboring states and expands health care access and options across Illinois passed and was signed into law I'm still exploring how else we can support and protect patients coming in from neighboring states!
Ah, my bad.
I just thought it was relevant here, as a tangent to the first comment.
I would fully love to discuss this with the Rep/Op, but my facetious rephrasing of the first question to demonstrate how parallel I see the situations probably came off douchey and argumentative.
Again, my bad.
LOTS of doorknocking and lots of conversations We had hardworking, talented, and committed folks on our campaign, including MANY young people who were excited about a young person running for office We put together a solid campaign, and in the general election, I'm glad the state party supported us.
It means a lot when a state party is willing to support young people in this space.
