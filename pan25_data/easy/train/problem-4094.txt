In my 20s I would happily eat fast food plenty.
I was physically active and generally felt fine.
Once I hit my 30s I really started feeling the difference in what I ate.
One fast food meal will make me lethargic for hours and I just generally don't feel good.
I still indulge from time to time but I can feel the difference when I do versus eating clean roast veggies and low fat proteins.
Crazy how people just house garbage everyday and still function.
Issue isn't regular consumption.
Nobody is harmed by an occasional energy drink, including kids.
The issue is, that due to taste and marketing, energy drinks promote massive overconsumption.
And _that_ causes problems.
Not only from the caffeeine but also from the ridiculous amounts of sugar in there.
And if coffee was filled with insane amounts of sugar and marketed by their favourite streamers to teens as a cool drink, I too would support the same thing there.
Fuing finally!
Someone have to be first.
I hate seeing kids with energy drinks.
Minors shouldn't be able to buy caffeinated drinks.
And honestly, Cola should be included.
