So Russia would have to somehow land a force of what 10 million soldiers to have even a hope of capturing and holding anything, then they would have to somehow march over thousands of kilometers of tundra before they even came across a settlement of more than 2-300 people.
The mass mobilisation of the population would be immediate, and the fact Russia would have to transport millions of troops thousands of KM just to attack any meaningful target they would be easy prey for our airforce while the country builds defences and trains troops.
We have the capacity to ramp up our military exponentially we also have access to the world's most advanced weapons and would be supplied by all of our allies, Russia would be eaten alive if they even tried to attack us even if we only got material support.
Yes i could see that.
Also, I don't ever see a scenario where the country of Russia as a whole is dissolved, I just see in the scenario you brought up them being reduced greatly in size, mostly just keeping Moscow/St Petersburg, European side of the country.
