To put it in other terms: if the police would only arrest poor ppl for murder, that doesn't automatically make the law against murder unfair.
It may just mean that the police are bigots or corrupt.
Or maybe that other person wasn't a suspect yet.
You'd need the demonstrate that the text of the law explicitly prevents the police from arresting non-poor ppl (or whatever specific exclusion) for murder to show the problem is not how the police apply the law, but that the law itself simply can't be applied in a fair way.
I agree.
These Islamist countries are like your racist uncle Jerry.
You tell him, "Jerry, we want you at Thanksgiving, but you can't come until you stop dropping N-bombs with a hard R at the table.

ok firstly the only source in Wikipedia about Morocco is the Guardian( not very trustworthy due to their source anonymously ), second, the king and the former prime ministers were targeted, third, "according to your Wikipedia source" European countries in the EU were also using it which is questionable by itself including Poland and Italy.
