Absolutely.
I just feel that the fact that the government didnt know they were missing to be alarming.
If its top secret or SCIF stuff then we obviously need to find out HOW this happened.
The details of all of this matter.

Exactly.
If NARA, the CIA, FBI and the DOJ didn't notice they were missing, probably not of any real significance.
And, if the Biden administration wasn't being completely transparent, we wouldn't know about it at all....
Conspiracy theorists will have a field day with this, get the popcorn ready.
Literally less documents.
Less critical documents(that we know of).
Heâ€™s an active president, Trump was not.
Biden initiated the discovery and handing over immediately, Trump hid, lied, and obstructed DOJ/National Archives for months(if not years).
This is nonsense.
If Biden was covering his ass....they simply would not have said anything.
Remember-this is Bidens team turning this stuff over that NO ONE even knew was missing.
