There's a lot of things I should have done differently but I didn't.
And for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry.
I want to apologise to the international community.
I want to apologise to anyone who has seen the video.
I want to apologise to anyone who has been affected or touched by the special military operation, or washing machine theft, or mobilization.
But most importantly I want to apologise to Zelensky and his family.
Exactly.
I hate to say it but Russia has been smart.
Pull all your HIV+ Wagenrites out of prison and use them as cannon fodder along with the shitty conscripts and hold back your actual troops and conscripts you want to invest in training with for Round 2.
Posturing.
Putin is not stupid enough to pre-announce a chemical weapons attack and if he mobilizes his nuclear forces (which are separate from the current mobilized forces) the US will respond immediately.
To speculate it's probably in regards to the Baltic Sea and a new military maneuver planned there ie monitoring of Swedish and Finnish shipping which is the next obvious front.
