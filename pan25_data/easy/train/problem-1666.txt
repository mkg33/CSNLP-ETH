Though it's rather laughable that a judge needs to know how the Constitution is amended or how the president's executive powers works.
As Charnelle Bjelkengren is already a sitting judge on a superior court, she doesn't deal with anything related to these 'laws' that Kennedy is questioning her on.
Willing to bet if someone turned the spotlight on Kennedy, he wouldn't know what Article Two or Article Five says.
Willing to bet if I put the author in the spotlight and questioned them before they wrote this article they wouldn't be able to answer what these two Articles were about.
So I find the title of the article misleading, as Kennedy isn't asking anything related to what Bjelkengren is going to be handling in the day to day if she were to be placed as a judge on the Eastern District of Washinon.

Disagree.
Knowing and recalling are two different actions, and no one should be expected to recall every detail of the USC on the fly - especially pieces that have no relevance to the person's current or prospective job.
