both countries receive a ton of foreign aid, they just arent good for anything else which is why they are mostly ignored.
india has the second largest population on the planet and could potentially be the next china.
Middling negotiator?
Bruh India's extracting maximum benefits from its relationship with both Russia and the west.
It somehow has the joint defence ventures with Russia which produce missiles, fighters, tanks and guns all while it sells Russian oil to the west and Is setting up joint ventures for development and production of drones, ifvs, rifles, electronics and a shitload of other new military equipment with the US and other western countries at the same time.
On top of that it's managed to maintain great relations with opposing sides in multiple conflicts, from Yemen-saudis, Iran-Iraq, US-Russia, to Israel-rest of the middle East.
Even in the Ukraine-Russia conflict despite india not providing any military support and buying Russian oil, india has still somehow managed to maintain good enough relations that zelensky himself still thanked India for support.
Name one other country which has managed to so successfully navigate itself diplomatically through so much turmoil?
