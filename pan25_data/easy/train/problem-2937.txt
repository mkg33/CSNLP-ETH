I think Iraq, a country that had basically zero to do with 9/11, is all the evidence anyone needs of that.
The US needed a war and it was seeking volunteers.
The hypocrisy and idiocy of everyone here in the comments lashing out on Pakistan for doing exactly what India did, and India even publicly declared it wont stop using Russian oil/gas or make its business boycott Russia.
Yes.
But not ICBM capable ones.
They have ballistic warheads, intermediates, ship- and air-based, and some tactical nukes — they’re much more concerned with threatening India than force projection.
Right?
The US has had a LONG standing military relationship with Pakistan for decades for this very reason.
It's not like we just started selling them stuff.
What we actually sold them were upgrade kits for their existing fleet of F16s that we sold them ages ago.
EXACTLY!
that’s why I’m saying with respect to China they haven’t really been tested.
For all we know their just as disorganized, Altho I doubt it.
They’ve always seemed to run a tighter ship to be honest.
