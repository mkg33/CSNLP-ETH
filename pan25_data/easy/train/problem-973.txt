look I've done nothing wrong, nothing Criminal, not like the Radical Left, who hurt us very badly so so many times, I came in, "Sir, we have no Armor," I said what happened, "Obama, Sir, he hates the Military," and nobody's better at it than me ok, I've done a lot, probably got 100% of the Military Vote, but the Fake News would never tell you that, and when you see what I've done for our History, they say, "Trump is the Greatest Person Who's Ever Lived," and we had a lot of that, way more than the Democrats, and you had horrible people like Aretha Franklin, who treated me very unfairly by the way, almost as bad as Crooked Hillary if you can believe it, worse in some ways, you know what I'm talking about, and now you have Sleepy Joe, he's tearing our Country apart, our Beautiful Country.
we used to have so many good things under Trump, but now, now we're Living In Harlem, you know what I mean, it's a Living Hell, ok, thank you, and I should tell you you're welcome if we're being honest about it.
