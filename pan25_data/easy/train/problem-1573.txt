The comments I've seen there seem fairly level headed overall.
I don't know how this compares to other times because this is the first time I've gone to the conservative sub.
Though there is still some disconnect - people keep listing the problems with the Republican platform and it's like "why are you voting Republican if you agree their platform is such bullshit?"
And people chiming in that Libertarian is the way to go.
That might connect with people who want to be conservative but it's the marijuana and abortion stuff that makes them vote Dem but overall I don't know that there's ever been a successful Libertarian effort in the US.
I keep thinking about the town on the East Coast that went totally Libertarian and wound up with increased bear attacks and garbage everywhere because they got rid of shit like garbage collection with no plan to replace the service.
Jesus Christ.
And voting increases with age so at this rate they will always be outvoted.
From now on when someone complains I'm going to ask to see their "I Voted" sticker lol.
