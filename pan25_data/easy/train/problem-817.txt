That's because, at the end of the day, these people don't have principles so much as they have doctrines.
You must adhere to the doctrine - which is subject to change depending on which decade it currently is - and as long as you do that, any and all actions or "indiscretions" are tolerable.
Look at how they're so quick to forgive their own and call for everyone to "move on" when the criminal is a Christian man and the victim is a female child, for example.
Josh Duggar is the poster-child for this.
Look at how they excuse Donald Trump's well known adultery and pervishness: because the victims are women and the perpetrator is a man, and their doctrine says that men are sexual animals who cannot control themselves adequately, and that women are responsible for making us "behave".
Therefore Trump's behavior, while sub-optimal in their view, is not outside of doctrine.
It can be excused away without guilt, because it fits the model of the world they are told has been passed down to us straight from Jesus' dick-tip.
I wish I was joking, but that's the fucking truth.
