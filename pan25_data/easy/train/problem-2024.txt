India's invested a ridiculous amount in solar -- its installed the amount of solar capacity.
But it simply can't make up for what oil can do, such as fuel trucks that transport food.
The price of oil thus directly affects the price of food, and that's a big deal for a country that is still trying to give everyone access to enough food (a third of all malnourished people in the world are in India).
Incorrect.
I asserted that because BRENT is at pre-war levels, one can't argue that India is buying Russian oil out of dire necessity given that India effectively wasn't buying Russian oil before the war (the articles says that), , and BRENT .
Thank you for acknowledging that India buying Russian oil is simply doing the terrorist state a diplomatic favor, and not some sort of dire need that we've been led to believe.
Duly noted that India's needs include doing, as you said, doing a diplomatic favor to a in Russia buy starting to buy its oil in huge amounts, thus perpetuating the war it wages, destruction, and endless Russian and Ukrainian deaths.
