SCOTUS became illegitimate when McConnell refused to allow a vote on Garland.
Every decision in which Gorsuch was the swing vote is illegitimate, in my view.
Replacing Ginsburg with ACB was legitimate, but is made illegitimate because of McConnell's decision on Garland.
Had he just been fair and consistent, he still would have a majority on the court because of how Kennedy allowed himself to be replaced by Trump.
Then they'd have all of the same shitty decisions, except we couldn't really call them illegitimate.

Neither Citizen's United NOR Shelby were illegitimate.
Especially not Citizen's United ... they had Gisburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor in the majority.
I disagree with Roberts on Shelby, but at the end of the day it was Kennedy (and to a lesser extent, Scalia) that betrayed us on that one.
We knew who Roberts, Alito, and Thomas were.
Investigations, actions, hopefully jail time and companies being massively fined before being shut down for being part of it then legislation that education should be a not for profit institution and that raising prices dramatically above inflation isn't permitted.
