Biden wasn't my first pick for president either, and he's certainly not a candidate it's easy to get excited about... but he's in the White House.
At this stage, it seems riskier to give up that ground in hopes of a better candidate emerging.
The incumbency advantage is a real thing, and he's got the momentum of his accomplishments thus far to run on.
The second a viable candidate gains the momentum he has, I'll throw my support behind them.
(Then again, this is all coming from a guy whose main priority is to keep any of the Republican frontrunners as far from office as possible.
).
The party has done a remarkable job considering dark money, voter suppression, conservative courts and gerrymandering.
I'd grant that.
Obama and Clinton would never have pulled out of Afghanistan, for a start.
Even trump was too chickenshit for that, and republicans are usually insulated from the soft-on-foreign-policy canard.
Who wouldn't?
Anyone who thinks Biden should step down and let someone younger run are fools.
Dem will completely get demolished and lose both presidency and congress to GOP.
Exactly.
You could tell gavin newsome was thinking about his future in like 2021 and there was a little bit of noise from JB Pritzker the last year or so but as far as DC Democrats go, nobody is in a position to do squat.
