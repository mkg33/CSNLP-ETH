Any idea where the 100 billion actually are?
AFAIK Germany’s annual defense budget was 50 billion Euros even before Ukraine.
That sounds like a sufficient budget to field a respectable military, with operational tanks among other things.
It’s 2.5x higher than Israel’s or Poland’s, and about the same of Saudi Arabia’s, which is known for splurging on equipment and is actively fighting a war.
Honestly asking - where’d the money go?
Corruption?
Germany has a reputation for low corruption, so I’d be surprised if all of it went to lining pockets.
Invested in the Air Force while the tank corps were neglected?
Salaries?
Could be a dark secret with him and russia.
He says proud that we're on the third place with aid for Ukraine.
But that's nothing you can be proud of if there are still people dying because you take your time with your decisions.
PzH 2000 compare to Puma is the "bigger weapon" so sending Pumas doesn't change anything, we won't get sucked deeper in this war for it.
it just helps Ukraine to get rid of these animals.
Actually we're already so deep in it, that we should do anything we can to help Ukraine and let Russia bleed.
People loosing their companys that they build over years.
The hole world is bleeding by the Russian agression.
It's time to fight back strong and fast, even if this just means to handle out material and Ukraine fights back.
Give them everything they want and need and even more to get rid of these animals.
I'm also ok if we give them that much that the hole world get rid of them.
