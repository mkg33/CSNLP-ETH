For those who need a bit more positivity and anxiety relief from all the end of the world apocalypse doomers in the top comments the spread to minks has only happened to one farm and all were culled and contained successfully with no human infections.
Currently all predators found sick have been mainly known scavengers and carnivores, with bird being common/semi-common in their pallets like Bears Foxes Seals and Otters, likely ate a carcass that was infected and the high traces of infection overwhelmed their immune systems when consumed.
It still of course needs to be monitored carefully and closely just like all previous spreads of avian flu.
Its also not the first time a mammal like minks have been infected there was a time during the 2013 or 2016 outbreak where cats were effected for reasons said above.
Its so far is not believed to of heavily mutated to spread to mammals currently, though there nothing stopping it of course either though it may also just stick to birds and infecting the occasional mammal upon consuming or close contact.
We also have a large stockpile of human vaccines that are proven effective and can help the populace if it does begin to spread to us to lower spread and deadliness.
It would still be a bad outbreak but we are in a way prepared aswell since every outbreak has always raised these same concerns over and over again thought for good reason.
It also doesnt mean if it spread to a human its spreadable from human to human, it could be deadlocked like covid was to just animal to human.
exactly.
There is a big misunderstanding by common people that virus will become less lethal if they spread more.
