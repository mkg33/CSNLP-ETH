Ukraine accepts ceasefire, but responds to Russia's inevitable attack during the ceasefire.
Russia whines loudly about how evil Ukraine has violated the ceasefire and must be punished.
No concessions to Russia, no appeasement, no ceasefire, and no peace talks until the last Russian soldier leaves Ukrainian land (pre-2014 borders).
Ukraine tells Russia to go fuck itself with the ceasefire offer given the history of Russia blatantly violating such deals a gazillion times since 2014, and the inanity of asking for a ceasefire while retreating in the midst of an invasion that genocidal.
Russia makes a sad face and cries "why u no want peace", calls Ukraine a warmonger, and has the usual audience of brain-dead morons point fingers at Ukraine, NATO, the EU, etc.
Out of these three options, the third one is the only sane choice, because Russia will accuse Ukraine of warmongering while invading it in any case.
They broke every truce, every humanitarian deal, literally everything.
They tried to break the grain deal by force and only Turkish ultimatum stopped them.
They only understand and accept physical strenh, there is no reason for diplomacy with such people.
