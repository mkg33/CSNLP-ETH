"Fine, after denying it for 40 years we will finally admit climate change is real BUT we're going to claim it's not caused by people so there's nothing we can do.
Maybe in 20 more years we'll admit it was us all along, you know, when it's really too late.

"Recent analyses have reported catastrophic global declines in vertebrate populations.
However, the distillation of many trends into a global mean index obscures the variation that can inform conservation measures and can be sensitive to analytical decisions.
For example, previous analyses have estimated a mean vertebrate decline of more than 50% since 1970 (Living Planet Index).Here we show, however, that this estimate is driven by less than 3% of vertebrate populations; if these extremely declining populations are excluded, the global trend switches to an increase.
The sensitivity of global mean trends to outliers suggests that more informative indices are needed.
We propose an alternative approach, which identifies clusters of extreme decline (or increase) that differ statistically from the majority of population trends.We show that, of taxonomicâ€“geographic systems in the Living Planet Index, 16 systems contain clusters of extreme decline (comprising around 1% of populations; these extreme declines occur disproportionately in larger animals) and 7 contain extreme increases (around 0.4% of populations).
The remaining 98.6% of populations across all systems showed no mean global trend.

Greed and selfishness are core human features and who denies it is either too stuck on Disney movies or just too blind and or in denial to see it - Politicians, Corporate People and very influencial rich people (to say the figureheads) in 70s didnt care if the world would turn to sht in th 2000s and beyond: they would be probably dead.
