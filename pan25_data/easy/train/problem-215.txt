American optimism, willingness to divulge, eager info eaters just slurping up planted ideas.
This is because conservatives are easy marks, i.e.
mostly not fluent in basic information warfare techniques.
Therefore they are easy to program at scale.

Hamsters….
Finally, it seems highly probably that every competent intelligence agency on the planet has plants in every major social network, with the American services not only working counter-intelligence, but probably super-entrenched in all kinds of ways.
Ya think?!
lol.

Russia has created the narrative and have driven the right in america off a cliff of stupidity and lies.
Unbelievable.
America would never interfere in a sovereign foreign countries election.
I’m sure the CIA is registering voters in Libya and Honduras as we speak.
