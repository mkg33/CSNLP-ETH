Yeah I don't know nearly enough about other country's healthcare to speak on them, I just know I've had some frustrating experiences in the US.
Currently have a $5k bill for a medicine I'm supposed to take every 8 weeks that I haven't paid and haven't been able to refill for months as a result.
The medication is $24k before insurance and the rest is usually covered by a copay assistance program but they have an anual limit so the remainder is supposed to be covered by ANOTHER program I had to enroll in through my employer and none of them will pay the 5k.
if it was just one protest?
sure - but with a slowdown in economic growth the state might decide to cut more social spending which is a big part of why the populace has not risen up before.
People accept a curtailing of civil liberties more easily if they benefit from society as a whole.
If people do not have enough money then they get pissed at the government and if the government as it is used to responds with violence the people get angrier.
