Don't be.
Once Turkey gives its vote, the rest of NATO and the EU have lots of ways to pressure Hungary to give it up.
Hungary doesn't have strategic importance to NATO like Turkey does.
Ridiculous, and patently unrealistic.
Riddle me this: if Putin's army is on the ropes from what was supposed to be a "quick" Ukraine invasion: then how's he supposed to invade several other countries, simultaneously??
And even assuming Putin thought he could bully the world through nuclear blackmail: what's to stop NATO, et al, from covertly supplying these invaded nations--just as they're doing with Ukraine?
And YOU realize that Putin regards Finland's membership into NATO as a threat--when he hasn't threatened Finland, right?
?
Military analysts overestimated Russia's military competence and preparedness coming into Ukraine, such that the US and other countries were mostly preparing the AFU to fight a guerilla war with the assumption that Russia would take most of Ukraine in the first week.
But with that said, that came close to happening anyway, the battle for Antonov airport was closer than people realize and had Russia been quicker with the reinforcements they could have had thousands of their best troops and equipment right outside of Kyiv ready to capture the city, Zelensky and the rest of his government in a decapitation strike.
