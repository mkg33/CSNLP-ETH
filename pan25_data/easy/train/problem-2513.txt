In my small village the food bank is running on empty, literally to many people needing help and no donations.
I would venture a guess that the smaller communities are fairing far worse through this than the larger ones, we have a higher unemployment rate and a higher amount of poverty per capita than larger communities.
Before all this shit started going down locally the child poverty rate was around 25% of the kids going without 1 or 2 meals everyday.
I can't even imagine what it is now.
I know they have shut down the school meal programs because they have too few donations and to many hungry kids.
You see all these people online saying things like "good, too many fat people in Canada" or "they should stop spending all their money on ____ " none of this is the case in rural Canada.
The poverty is real here, and the (absolutely awful) housing crisis means that moving to a more prosperous location is nearly impossible.
Groceries aren't terribly elastic.
We all need to eat.
Most of us buy groceries weekly, and we "stockpile" whatever we can because buying non perishables in bulk is cheaper.
