I'm like...
I wish I could discuss pornography with that level of frankness, because honestly the one time a friend of mine brought the subject up, the group just shamed him so hard he changed schools.
I feel bad about it now and wish I spoke up more.
But like yeah, regular people just don't talk about sex at all.
Anecdotally, the only time I've seen sex brought up in public outside of sex ed was in church.
Straight up this guy starts talking about his experiences with pornography, how he knows it's wrong but he kind of likes it.
Nobody batted an eye.
Another thing that saddens me is that I probably wouldn't have ever questioned or judged my gender or that others had it not been for the emphasis on it and the toxic aspects of heteronormative stereotypes that are reinforced by the in group, such as taking your man card, girls can't play that game, having people yell homosexual slurs at you from their truck while you are riding your bike or walking, anti dating culture taken to extremes, virgin worship, slut shaming, looking down on divorcees, etc.
