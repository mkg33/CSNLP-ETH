With everything going how it is in ukraine, moldova likely isn't under IMMEDIATE threat.
For now all the training going into ukraine is directly combating the threat to moldova so it could just be that, along with the fact that without any clue what's going on behind the scenes in russia exactly, pumping up training for moldova could prove to be worse than a surprise attack with what they currently have.
How is that such a joke?
If I were Ukraine and had nothing to lose in terms of Russian relations, I’d absolutely invade Transistria if my generals told me I could spare the resources to do it.
It’s an isolated pocket that can’t resupply.
And cleaning it up of Russians could allow Moldova to be more cooperative.
Not that Moldova has many resources to contribute, but the land itself could be useful.
Mobilization is very expensive.
Even Ukraine didn't mobilize until after SHTF because by then there was no choice.
Moldova ain't exactly flush with cash to be mobilizing without a guaranteed reason to be.
