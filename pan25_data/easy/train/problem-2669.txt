HK could grow their own, and the effects of marijuana - a drug with problems of its own - are still far less injurious than alcohol or tobacco, much less opium.
The West need not be involved at all.
I see this move by HK as a self-destructive backlash, that goes too far in the other direction, which will cause more damage to HK than marijuana could.
HK could learn something from America in this boondoggle.
Hell for all we know the people who report highs from CBD have issues with their bloods ph buffering which does biological magic to convert some of it to delta 8, but the liver turning the delta 9 into delta 11 when consuming edibles is the real alchemical holy grail of buzz potency and i personally think it would be best to avoid the alternatives to the real deal delta 9 unless you are consuming the substance for some medically relevant reason beyond recreational inebriation, at least until we get full legalization and studies conducted on side effects and variables pertaining to light or heavy consumption.
