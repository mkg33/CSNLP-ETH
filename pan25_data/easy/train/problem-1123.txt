Conservative??
They are in no way conservatives They are a communist cult.
Putin is a respected leader to them and Russia is their roadmap for our country.
If Obama acted like that they would call him a commie morning noon and night and win!
We let republicans do whatever the Fuck they want and call them semi fascists.
So dumb.
Conservatives favor stable institutions, steady relationships with allies, and the preservation of the social status quo.
What don't conservatives do?
Let's see.
For starters, they don't try to use paramilitaries to zip tie members of Congress they disagree with.
They don't dissolve the electoral college because it persists in reflecting their unpopularity back at them.
They don't default to capitulating to aggressive imperialists.
