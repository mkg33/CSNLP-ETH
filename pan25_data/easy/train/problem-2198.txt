Great questions!
Committees are the way that Congress apportions responsibility for an issue.
So being on powerful committees with jurisdiction over key policy areas gives members more power within the chamber.
In terms of committee function, I view committees as the legislative concourse leading up to bill passage.
Studying them provides an understanding of the legislative process.
And this process still has some working parts.
In particular, I argue that committees in which the leadership (chairs and ranking members) and their respective staff have good relationships and committee hearings on issues not yet colored by partisanship are where there may still be space for learning and deliberation in Congress.
Hi!
Is there a committee on "congressional dysfunction"?
and i'm not asking kiddingly - other than the GAO (which helps congress with facts/audits) is there any auditing done to Congress?
It seems that all they do is throw the ball around and argue back & forth.
It would be nice if there was actually an Congress Accountability Act demanding that at least 50% of required decision-making is actually accomplished.
