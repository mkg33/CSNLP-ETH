I imagine when the Russian state gets you out of jail, you don't have much say in your life after that.
Now Bout may very well have joined this party on his own accord, but I imagine he was given some strong hints as to what to do and say.
Bhahahahahahahahah.
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahh.
Yeah cause no one in Russian government has tested gravity or shot themselves five times.

I'm not saying he has zero value to them(or else they wouldn't have wanted him back at all and wouldn't have been willing to give us even Griner back for him).
But for some folks to think that he's just going to slot right back into some position of power is just kinda silly & naive.
And, further to your point, he probably wasn't even as powerful then as some would believe, as the KGB were the ones pulling most of the strings on arms deals anyway.
