Now it’s a fucking game.
Everything is tough guy optics now.
“Oh look at me, I’m fighting these balloon attacks.” No one is sending up balloons right now except geopolitical trolls.
Are the tolls nation states, probably.
Are solo actors and groups of motivated capables getting in on the fun, again, probably.
So why try to puff up your chest and freak everyone out, mind control; it’s coercion via the protector trope.
“Imma save you from “insert favorite enemy here, then accuse them of the balloon trick”.
Get good bellicose propagandists….
I think it's a lie.
Normally I'd give anyone the benefit of the doubt, while reserving judgement either way, but I'm just going to go ahead and call this one a lie.
Balloons are backwards tech and superfluous if you have good satellites (which China lacks, apparently.)
Also, 10 is a nice, round number.
Not 11?
Not 8?
The US has flown exactly 10 balloons over China?
Backwards against the prevailing winds across the Pacific?
Or all the way across 3 continents and the Atlantic first?
It's been a couple of days for China to attach evidence to their accusation, and nothing so far.
So, unless it's proven otherwise at a later date, this is a lie, and worryingly, more evidence that one of the most powerful countries in the world has the diplomatic skills of a young child.
