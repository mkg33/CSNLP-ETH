I think Putin was waiting to see if Trump won reelection and, when that failed, whether Trump would bring the entire U.S. government down with his "Big Lie" campaign.
Plus, he probably had to wait for spring to launch his invasion.
(I hear Ukraine is a tad chilly during the winter.
).
Nevermind... of course Mainstream Corporate Media will continue to aid and abet the Fascist putsch to provide a platform to manufacture consent for the overthrow of Democracy in favor of Tabloid Fascism, because profits overrule the will of the people.
Why would you be happy?
The idiot lost but all the damage he did is still in place and his enablers are working to elect someone just as bad if not worse.
The country is falling off a cliff and kicking Trump out slowed us down by about 20%.
Mental confusion.
Bush II created the fake WMD's, Bush I was Saddam's friend from the Iran/Iraq war days and then double crossed Saddam into invading Iraq.
Trump is mentally confused (‚Äù) and is confusing Joe Biden with Bush II who gave Saddam green light to invade Kuwait.
