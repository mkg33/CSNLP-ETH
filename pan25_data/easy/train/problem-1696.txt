The deficit was more specifically a byproduct of Covid relief spending.
The rise in debt strongly correlates with Covid relief aid and Covid spending by the government.
It was effectively a necessary burden for public relief, PPE purchasing, and vaccine purchasing, not to mention mobilizing the armed forces and operating a nation wide vaccination program.
Nothing was free even though Americans got free money as Covid relief aid and free vaccinations.
The free part is basically new debt that we will eventually have to pay off.
Basically the government was maxing out all their credit cards.
Once we got through the big Covid burden, the government always had the need to retighten spending and start chipping away at that debt.
It doesn't match which president got elected either.
This is a 10 to 20 year long burden for Americans.
It's just that Democrats are generally more fiscally sound in how they manage debt, often stopping growth and beginning to whittle down on the dept dollars during their terms.
Debt growth rates generally spike during Republican terms, either because of wars started or tax cuts that are all too common for them.
So both the tax code reform Republicans pushed and tariffs Trump pushed all shoved billions and billions again of taxation on the lower and middle class.
Good stuff.
Another proposal would to create such coins every 7 years in accordance with the biblical year of jubilee where everyone forgives the debts of everyone, again minted with date and amount spreading out over the 49 times republican presidents raised it and the 29 times democratic presidents raised it.
