Putin in fact never threatened with nukes, not once.
Just read or listen to what he has been saying, listen to his words.
As a matter of fact in one of his recent speeches Putin stated that Russia will not use nukes first and will not use nukes second either.
If one follows the events carefully , one will clearly see where exactly threats and talks about nukes come from, and it's definitely not from Russia.
For instance : if you remember , few months ago Russians got blamed for shooting a missile into Polish village and killing 2 people; momentarily Ukraine began yelling about Article 5 () and the rest of NATO followed ; Russia denied shooting that missile; in a couple of days everyone found out that missile was Ukranian , but Zelensky never admitted it publicly, never apologised , and NATO said it's Russia's fault anyway.
NATO will never admit they f@ked up in Ukraine where things get worse and worse every day.
When Putin is done with Ukraine, NATO/US will just leave as usually and will stop talking about Ukraine.
And it's awful...P.S.
I have many family members and friends in different regions of Ukraine, I also have family in Crimea and few in Russia.
I communicate with all of them.
The reality in Ukraine is very different from what MSM tells us.
Just because Putin is bad does not mean that Zelensky is a good guy.
This war could've and should've been prevented to begin with; the peace negotiations that Russia offered many,many times should've been done.
Human life is much more valuable than territories that Ukraine will never get back.
Truth will be known, it will come out.
The Serbia subreddit is full of young, college-educated English-speaking Serbians, they are not representative of the nuclear grade nationalist delusions many Serbs have.
I dont know either.
I have several family members that still believe in russia.
And i live in switzerland.
I cant imagine how it is in serbia where the general education is much lower.
