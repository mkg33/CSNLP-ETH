This is something I’m really struggling with.
She retired in 2015 and ended up spending a lot of time taking care of my ailing grandfather.
She doesn’t have any friends so after he passed away, she has stayed glued to Fox News and gone to church much more than she did when I lived at home or even the many years up until my grandfather passed away.
She’s fallen into a big rabbit hole of culture way BS that is pushed, and you can’t even talk to her about anything outside of very surface level what we’ve been up to.
She had this crazy breakdown at Christmas where she gave my kids and my niece and nephew bibles as gifts and insisted my niece read this passage.
I bit my tongue the whole time.
My husband said if she keeps going down this path he will not be allowing us to go back.
It’s gotten so uncomfortable, but my heart aches thinking about cutting her off.
It’s been really difficult.
