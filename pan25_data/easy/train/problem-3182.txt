The Irish conflict known as the Troubles was primarily political and nationalistic, fuelled by historical events.
It also had an ethnic or sectarian dimension but despite use of the terms 'Protestant' and 'Catholic' to refer to the two sides, it was not a religious conflict.
It was a conflict of Protestant unionists (loyalists), who desired the province of Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, and the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic nationalists (republicans), who wanted Northern Ireland to become part of the republic of Ireland.

judaism is an abrahamic religion.
though I'd also argue that conservative jews/hasids aren't really all that "pro-education" either.
they're really only pro education concerning the torah and judaic studies and not particularly so for women, as they're just a couple of steps above islam as far as patriarchy goes.
Cultural?
Probably... One of his parents were Swedish, so he likely has some Swedish cultural traits..
