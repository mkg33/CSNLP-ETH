Subsidies in this context don't fix the problem, for the same reason rent controlled housing doesn't fix high rent prices, and the same reason why price caps on goods don't work (see the price caps that were attempted by Nixon on oil).

Prices should largely be determined by supply.
Obviously bad actors can collude to move prices, such as oil and gas playing with prices around election day.
