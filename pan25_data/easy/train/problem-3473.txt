Yeah but this time Medvedev hopes to capture it.
The next news update will be “A heavily armed Medvedev was seen crossing the border into Ukraine after a long montage of him strapping knives everywhere and tying a red bandanna around his forehead.
Upon reaching the border he commented ‘Aa Ukraine, I’m your worst nightmare’ and immediately charged into the brush.”.
History suggests they are dramatically overestimating the possibility of popular uprising.
But it's always possible one among the siloviki will decide he's got a better chance to seize power than to inherit it, and pull a Yeltsin.
Ichkeria started out as a constitutionally secular republic.
Between the two wars there were significant struggles between the executive branch and the judiciary which chose to implement a form of Shariah, islamic republic was declared right before the second war, the emirate before the official end of second war a decade later.
Yep.
But it isn’t Mariupol - they’ll never cross the Dnipro river again.
It’s too good of a natural defense, and they’re not in a position to make successful offensives anywhere anymore.
