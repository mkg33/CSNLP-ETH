No one has explained to me, logically how gay marriage affects the family dynamic.
Gay people are not going to marry straight, at least not without a lot of suffering and ultimately a bad marriage.
Excellent question.
Other cultures who have committed mass murder and genocide such as the United States and UK start by acknowledging that these events occurred and children learn about them in school.
That's a good start, and that history is not taught in Japan (ask me about watching a group of exchange students sit through a lecture on the Rape of Nanking).
The closest ally of Japan in WW2, Germany, does the same, and takes it further with official apologies to the victim nations and people and a restructuring of their culture.
That would be ideal for any nation that has committed such atrocities.
wanna increase population?
simple, let the homo couple be, they'll adopt, either domestically or foreign, which boosts population number.
Japan, prewar, was a hereditary military dictatorship.
Not all dictators are fascists, for example, Joseph Stalin was a communist.
