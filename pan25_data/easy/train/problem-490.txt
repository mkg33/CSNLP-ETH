It reminds me of an anecdote from "Donnie Brasco" by Joseph Pistone.
It was after the operation had ended and he was remarking on the long-term effects it had on him.
A major theme of the book is the balancing act between pretending to be a wiseguy and doing his job as a cop.
A large concern everyone had, is whether or not he'd be able to keep from "going native" so-to-speak.
He said that for the most part, there were no lasting effects.
Although his wife and kids noticed that overall he became a bit more confident, aggressive, and forceful sometimes.
Even lying a bit to get his way, although nothing truly serious.
He tells a small story about himself and his family at a restaurant.
The restaurant lost their reservation and he insisted otherwise until they seated him and his family.
His family was mortified and embarrassed but he didn't see the issue.
He figures, why roll over in obedient embarrassment when he knows he's right?
If you're right, stick to your guns, there's nothing to be ashamed of.
