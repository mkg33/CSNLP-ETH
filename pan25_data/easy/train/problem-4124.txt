Yeah solar and wind are extremely cheap and a good investment........but they don't fucking work when the sun ain't shinning and the wind ain't blowing.
It's easy to turn those gas plants on to replace the irregular energy sources and they are reliable and really easy to turn on but they burn fossil fuels.
You need to have baseline electricity that works day and night, windy or not and as we've seen in Europe and Germany is that they're still burning coal to make sure they have that reliable energy source during winter.
Nuclear is carbon free and can replace those fossil fuel plants that are still needed all over Europe and now that they've been cut off from their cheap source of gas and are entering the global LNG market those gas power plants are going to stay a looooot more expensive to run than it was during the easy Russian gas days.
Huh.
This is something to do with load balancing?
Like France exports power most of the time except when it gets cold, and then they have to import it?
No, actually.
RWE, the company also most openly abusing this treaty did, which there was no way to stop because they owned both the plants and the land.
Plus, the wind power installation was allegedly broken.
