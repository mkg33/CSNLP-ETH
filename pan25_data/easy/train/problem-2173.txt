Purely guessing, but having electronics capable of eaves-dropping below the ionosphere possibly makes it possible to gather intelligence that isn't possible to get from a satellite.
Nope.
An apartment sized balloon traveling on jet streams that can reach 275mph at 65,000ft would require a Sidewinder to kill to ensure the kill and minimize hazards to the aircraft.
A Reaper UAV could carry Sidewinders but it can only travel 200mph at 50,000ft.
They'd need to arm an RQ4 Global Hawk to have a chance at reliably killing that balloon with a drone, and that's only going to save them $60k per flight hour and provide little meaningful training as a Global Hawk will and should never play its role in contested airspace anyway.
We're designing a drone for that, the Loyal Wingman, and it will be neither cheap nor ready in a year nor have simple kinetic weapons, only missiles, which I remind you are the only reliable way to shoot down massive balloons floating on jet streams of up to 275mph in the stratosphere.
The missile cost more than the flight time in probably every interception this month.
You're not getting a gun lined up on a wildly unpredictable flight path of a lighter than air balloon.
