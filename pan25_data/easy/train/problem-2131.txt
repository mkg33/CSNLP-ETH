The people who hate on Bill Gates tend to be old enough to remember the 90s.
He was Darth Vader, father of the modern tech monopoly to the public back then.
He used public source technology to build Microsoft then pushed the internet to become more privatized and commercialized.
There was a Supreme Court case about it even.
Microsoft was the Amazon of the 90s.
He’s a true believer in private IP and the profit motive which recently caused a backlash against him again when he laid pressure on Oxford to keep Covid vaccine IPs private which arguably worsened what was termed at the time as “vaccine Apartheid”.
No.
I’d his ill-gotten gains had been taxed and put to work for society, there’d be less suffering on the aggregate.
Billionaire PR has convinced you that the massive harm their hoarding has caused is mitigated by the much less significant yet highly touted “philanthropy.” It’s a net loss for society.
More people would be alive if he just paid ducking taxes.
However, less attention is paid to his domestic educational philanthropy unless you’re really passionate about education policy.
And well, Bill Gates is the Koch brothers of destroying public schools against the will of voters in this country.
He’s poured an enormous amount of money into charter schools and standardized testing and recent studies have found all of these “reforms” to be failures.
Voters in WA Stated rejected his Charter School ballot measures multiple times and he kept coming back with it.
Zuckerberg also tried his hand at this with even less success.
So yeah, wonderful he gives so much money to education but on the other hand it comes with political strings attached and it’s particularly infuriating because it was due to his own academic freedom in Highschool he learned about computers.
