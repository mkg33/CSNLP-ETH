Now, do I agree with Republicans and the very specific threats they pose to our democracy?
I certainly do not.
However, the Democrats pose their own threats to the same in addition to having a wide range of overlap with their counterparts by the simple virtue of being politicians.
Both sides are voting to preserve the rights they believe in at the expense of other rights.
That being said, Democrats do not have some ethically ultimate high ground.
Sure, voting for a third party will never net results but it is your vote.
You’re entitled to it and are allowed to make that vote of your own volition.
If neither party represents you, don’t vote for them, and by extension, if none of them do then you’re not obligated to vote.
Voting in anyway for the simple sake of denying the other party is perpetuating the exact issue that got us here today and no amount of “progressivism” is going to change that.
The parties will continue to polarize, radicalize, and ultimately split the nation and the concept of voting for one party no matter what as opposed to voting for who represents you is exactly the driving force behind it all.
Thank you.
Also I'm a "she".
I guess I wasn't as clear on my point and you cleared it up.
I don't like Nancy Pelosi, but I would vote for her 50 million times before I voted for anybody on the GOP side.
But you know what fucked us over with the Supreme Court?
RBG not retiring the minute Obama won his 2nd term.
The elderly need to get out of the way, as soon as they have security to do so.
Stop waiting until you either die in the seat or get out voted by the other side.
Start mentoring and supplying money to younger, more educated folks.
The system is broken but they're still acting like it works like it did in the 1950s.
It doesn't.
