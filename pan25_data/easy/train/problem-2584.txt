In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Good.

Absolutely not.
Recall is a bad solution.
This is not a parliamentary type system.
If someone votes for someone they need to live with that choice and next time not make idiotic assumptions and actually spend time researching candidates.

the voting block that elected him has already displayed its analytical capabilities; even money says he gets re-elected just on incumbency and name-recognition.

As the story fades and the "outraged Republicans" in his district no longer have to defend their defense of a pathological liar, they'll revert to, "well, I wasn't happy with how he got there but he seems to be doing the job!"
It's the same mental hoops they go through with DJT.
