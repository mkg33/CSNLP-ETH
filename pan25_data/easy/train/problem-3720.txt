I copied for you "The Council voted against a delay.
China, Russia, Pakistan, Venezuela and other nations spoke against the removal of Iran from the Commission.
".
Dissolving the UN would massively destabilize world politics and terminate many humanitarian projects.
This might be the dumbest take Iâ€™ve seen on Reddit.
I also imagine that there's usually not a lot of impetus within the UN to go out of their way to deliberately remove a bad actor from their position on any given Council's Commission, because membership in these Commission is not a permanent affair - they have set terms they're voted in for, different member states can be elected/rotated in to replace them upon their term just naturally expiring.
Given that the purpose of the UN is, well, diplomacy there's probably a lot of member states who are happy to just let people quietly serve out their term as an inconsequential voice screeching into the aether and just opposing their re-election in the next vote (rather than creating a diplomatic incident by overtly ousting them.
).
