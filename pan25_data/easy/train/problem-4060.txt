I am sick of the stupid "spy balloon" story.
It shows me how easily the entire narrative in the US can be directed towards unimportant events.
We aren't rioting over being expected to survive an economy where 90 percent of the revenue is taken off the top by a small minority of ridiculously wealthy people, we aren't demanding a total reformation of our police despite rampant abuse of power and corruption, we aren't taking any steps to prevent daily mass shootings, we aren't even mad that an entire political party is openly embracing fascism.
We are yelling at a fucking balloon.
The system is functioning as intended.
Republicans criticize.
Full stop.
This is all they do.
They have no solutions, no answers, just partisan bickering, and trying to get their mugs on TV with juvenile reality TV stunts.
These are not serious lawmakers.
I wish we had a way to track what they actually do for the country, a running tally, and a way to broadcast it everywhere.
It really needs to be matter that these people are doing nothing for the country.
