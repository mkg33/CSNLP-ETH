Also, if the commander who lives this everyday with intimate knowledge about his enemy’s tactics and such tells you it’s something they routinely observe and experience, you’re proving to everyone skeptical of your reporting standards that you’re trying to stir shit by giving your own “opinion” that tensions are “brewing”.
Nope.
People like to play the America bad game and make false equivalencies and say “well what if this country encroached on our sovereign borders” without even understanding this this is typical Chinese imperialism, the same thing they’d critique the United States for.
Weird.
The video I saw was more of American aircraft, you are approaching Chinese airspace and we will intercept you if you come any closer.
And the American airplane responded with something like we will be maintaining distance.
Chinese plane remained with American plane till the American plane veered away.
There wasn't anything escalatory or de-escalating which seems to make more sense for such professional encounters.
Both sides are highly trained pilots.
There is a near 100% chance that stuff related to specific topics (military, guns, abortion, marriage equality, etc) are artificially enhanced in their emotionally inciting presentation despite already tension filled topics.
