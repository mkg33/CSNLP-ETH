I appreciate you taking the time to address this.
I am kind of frustrated by the fact that if someone posts a study commissioned by PPI or the Roosevelt Institute this sub would blindly accept it as the gospel truth, but if it's commissioned by a private corporation it's automatically just straight up wrong.
Good methodology is good methodology and I don't really see a flaw in theirs.

I didn’t get a supplement because the premiums are kinda expensive so I got the Advantage plan which at least limits my MOOP.
Mine is with a good local non profit insurance company.
Being in NY, I can switch to a supplement at any open enrollment.
Perhaps the companies are being paid too much per enrolled person- I don’t know.
I do like having the option.
To end, something called Payment-for-Order-Flow (really, really, really recommend watching the 15 minute video ) makes it clear that it's truly not an exaggeration to say there's a network of drunk, coked out Wall Street psychopaths skimming off the top hundreds of billions and billions of dollars that should be going to the middle and lower classes, resulting in horrible mental health, stagnant wages, struggling families, failing infrastructure, and piss-poor regulation of, oh I don't know, braking systems on trains carrying hazardous waste.
