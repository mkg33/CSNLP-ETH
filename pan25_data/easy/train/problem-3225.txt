If Sinema decides to run for reelection in Arizona, Democrats will be forced to choose whether to support her, stay neutral in the race or back a potential Democratic opponent.
The latter option could lead to a nightmare scenario for the party: a split vote in the general election between Sinema and any Democratic opponent, leading to an easy victory for Republicans.
Sen. Kyrsten Sinemaâ€™s decision to leave the Democratic Party and become an independent is putting top Democrats in a tricky position ahead of what is expected to be a brutal election year in 2024.
It all makes perfect sense.
There's no way this narcissist could make sure she's super rich for the rest of her life after her Senate run and still be a Democrat.
You will see when she's done with politics.
She will have a high level executive job from one of the companies that gave her millions of dollars.
It's that simple.
