You mean like EU, US trading with China since 1962 when India and China had a war or how about in 2020 when there were border clashes between them and soldiers died and EU and US never condemned and instead were begging China to keep churning out cheap stuff for Western population to consume?
No that is not true at all.
Taiwan holds strong trade routes to asia\\japan.
So basically Philippines, vietnam, Indonseia etc.
A huge chain of islands.
India opposed, requested and even loudly potested for Western nations to not invade and destroy Afghanistan and Iraq and yet Americans and many Europeans were so blinded by rage and greed that you have destroyed millions and killed millions across Middle East and when all those nations have turned to rubble, you left them abandoned only for poor survivors and poor nations around them left to gather themselves and survive.
Screw you for assuming i want them to be meat shields.
My first post was simply asking a question i had no idea about the history of india and why they are supporting russia while they invaded and took a large proportion of ukraine after the treaty on top of murdering thousands of civilians.
I am still standing strong with my initial argument that the fucking actual invasion that happened in india in the 60s was over half a centry ago, and that border fight was not an actual large scale military invasion and was more a skirmish conflict unlike what we are seeing in ukraine.
its not even comparable and i will stand by that.
