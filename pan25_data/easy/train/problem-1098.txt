Yea, sad but true, resources have shrunk to the point that people are actively choosing to not reproduce frequently and en masse, fighting wars over the last few truly valuable mineral lodes, and generally failing to thrive because there simply isn’t enough to go around.
People say that “we’re all gonna die because muh Easter island wah” but fail to remember that yes, there was a resource related population crash on Rapa Nui because they devastated their environment, but the population went from 10,000 to 3,000 in over three generations and that Rapa Nui’s population was growing, not shrinking, when the Europeans arrived and stole away much of what remained of their workforce.
The Rapa Nui did suffer infighting, but it was not like people were barking like mad dogs tearing at each other over scraps, it was the compounding of multiple issues including political infighting, “too little too late” environmental policy, low fertility, religious zealotry and dangerous cultural fads that reduced the population.
You know, like exactly what is happening right now.
Just cross your fingers E. T. doesn’t show up and put us on his space-sugarcane plantation while we’re trying to get our feet back under ourselves.
Sometimes economic recession and shrinking population is good.
Now is that time.
Everywhere.
Every trade agreement India makes includes clauses that ease the migration of Indian migrants to the trade partner country.
And of course many still keep families in India so the money still flows to India.
It’s clever economics.
