It’s not so much about differences in policy as it is keeping the power of the incumbent, because it is real.
He’s already shown his ability to listen to progressives and act on issues like student loan forgiveness (take it up with the Roberts court), federal marijuana policy, and reshaping the judiciary with a diverse bench.
But it’s also important to remember that Biden’s electability came from his appeal with independents.
Left wing allies in Congress are important, but the ideal presidential candidate is someone who can answer the calls of progressives while still winning over moderates and independent voters in a general election like Biden did.
Huh?
Are you saying people that wanted Bernie are in the minority or something?
I'd agree.
Id like a younger Bernie Sanders esque candidate.
The presidency is a decision making position that requires intelligence, judgment, world knowledge, public speaking/communication skills, and charisma.
All of which Stewart has in spades.
The president doesn’t need to have all the answers, the president needs to be able to recognize the people who do have the answers and then get everyone on board.
Stewart absolutely has the chops for that.
