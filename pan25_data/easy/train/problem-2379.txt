You can't have people deciding religion on their own.
That'd be preposterous.
I mean think about it.
What would happen if you didn't raise anyone religious from birth and then had them research and make a conscious choice about faith when they were of mature, rational age.
I mean, come on, how could religion even survive.

Fuck OFF.
