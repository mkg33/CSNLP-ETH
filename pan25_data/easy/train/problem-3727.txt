Trump or not, the invasion would have happened regardless.
The outcome would have been different, but the invasion was going to happen, because Putin has a crazy mystical ideology of Russia's primacy and destiny, not pragmatic concerns about Russia's security.
The theory that Putin invaded Ukraine because of NATO related reasons is you just gobbling up russian propaganda, exhibiting a shocking display of dim-witted US-centrism AND ignoring the fact that NOT EVERYTHING IN THE FUCKING WORLD IS ABOUT AMERICA, so start treating other countries like having legitimate interests outside of what america says or does.
No, NATO enchroachment and the US were a pretext for the invasion (and a flimsy one at that, seeing as how Putin is commiting the entire strategic arsenal of missiles, and the reserve forces bordering NATO, or NATO-aligned countries), the goal was always the political alignment of Ukraine or outright annexation.
Lend-lease is what I was waiting to see.
Ukraine has tons of natural resources that are ripe for extraction.
Just like how the US saw such a boom economy after WWII (cause all the infrastructure as destroyed in Europe), Ukraine will provide a great boon for American industry.
