Tim Burchett used to live right next door to my in-laws here in west Knoxville, in an upper middle class high end suburb.
He plays the good ol southern boy real well, just far enough to pander to the east TN base here.
In reality, underneath that he is a wealthy ivy leaguer who only pretends to be a common working class guy.
His house sold for like 900K around the beginning of the pandemic.
He bought a “farm” house / mansion in a more countryish area of town to further selling his country image to the local right wing.
I’ve interacted with him many times on a personal level in family settings.
He is an absolute charlatan, who will say anything to stay popular with the fringe, and I really don’t respect him on that alone on top of how he positions himself politically.
I feel bad for his daughter.
She seemed like a nice kid when they lived there.
I disagree with you that people who are familiar with what they're talking about and correct misinformation are automatically Republicans and that people who correct you specifically are automatically bots.
