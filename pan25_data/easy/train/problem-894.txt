WTF is wrong with these arsehole countries, internal pressures as a result of our own incompetence and stupid policies, we know how to fix it lets starts messing with other countries to divert the attention away.
Instead of starting wars or building nukes how about just not being a dick?
Propaganda?
You tell me what other super power you want controlling the world.
Have you seen what Russia has done in Ukraine?
Have you seen what China has done in Hong Kong?
Stop being a fool talking on your high horse bitching and complaining.
This is the real world your feelings and beliefs are not practical given the world we live in.
I’m sorry you can’t understand that there are terrible countries in this world that want to do truly bad things on a global scale and the US is the protecter-it of it.
You give me another solution please before you give some sorry half ass explanation.
How do you stop the bad countries like Russia and China in this world without having an equally powerful good country?
You are a fool my friend a fool.
China's in for a ride awakening if it thinks it can successfully invade Taiwan whilst the US has effectively infinite budget and manufacturing capability to send a steady stream of current and next-genetation weapons and materiel to Taiwan and other allies in the area.
