This is going to be VEEP level shit-flinging behind the scenes or worse.
A majority of the Republican caucus is batshit fucking insane, but they need pretty much all of the remainder of the caucus to pass anything.
They also need all of the "reasonable" members to stop bills that are popular with the public, or necessary like the budget or debt ceiling raises because you can be sure the Democrats will vote mostly in lock-step with the senate.
All the Democrats need is a few defections to pass budget bills and I'd be surprised if there aren't a few normal Republicans that aren't willing to defect to keep the government running and not piss off their narrow majority they won with in their swing districts.
It's going to be super embarrassing when Dems manage to pass more bills and budgets into law than Republicans do in the chamber that they control.
Exactly.
This is the scum bag move that I hate the most.
They take credit for something that passed, when they themselves were actively trying to derail or sabotage said topic.
It’s the main reason I hate them as a party.
It’s the hypocrisy of it all.
Absolutely.
The Speaker will need Dem support to pass anything including must pass legislation to keep Government open.
Repubs will be falling over each other to see who can be the biggest whack job grandstanding in front of the cameras shouting about Hunter’s laptop and Afghanistan withdrawal.
At the end of the day, Dems will be the adults in the room as usual.
