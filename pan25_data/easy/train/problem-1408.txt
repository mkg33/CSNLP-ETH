I guess I am a little torn how it’ll play out, but I’ll say Desantis has created quite a buzz.
If he manages to secure his nominee spot from trump (the harder battle imo), from there, he has a great chance of winning the election too.
Any Trump supporter will easily support Desantis (assuming T gets paid off and shuts up at least a few weeks prior to the election) yet, Desantis probably has a bigger chance of pulling “moderates” or even the disillusioned left.
People with money will know that, it’ll just be a matter of do they feel more legitimately scared of Trump and consequently feel the need to support him (he destroys people after all) or feel the need to take the plunge to support the younger golden boy who, imo, has a better chance of a legitimate win.
However, Trump might do Jan 6th part 2 for an illegitimate win as well, so really it’s a matter of how well he plays his cards.
