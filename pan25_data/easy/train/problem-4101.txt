The problem is that DeSantis effort is deeply tied with the completely lost cause of a "Christian America" and the roll back of the 60s- 70s sexual revolution unlike the rollback of 2010 progressivism has little to no support outside the hard right.
The other portion of DeSantis's vision that will likely torpedo his campaign is a commitment to paleo-con libertarianism.
The Gen X suburbanites he needs to win over to win the culture war don't really want to experiment with the end of the welfare state and that is really what the Republican donor base cares about.
This is not even to mention the real problem which is that the Republican Party is neither disciplined or savvy outside of DeSantis and will not even commit to DeSantis relatively clean cut hard conservative image and instead will continue to shoot themselves in the foot by presenting themselves as moronic crazy people.
I don't really see DeSantis counter-revolution working outside of a few red states.
I don't think The Republican Party has the discipline and I don't think DeSantis has the moderation to pull it off.
Incorrect.
He’s the darling of the far right all over the country.
He’s the unofficial leader of the Republican Governors Association, and big bucks trump donors are switching to DeSantis.
Better pay attention.
He’s going to run for president He’s Evil and he’s dangerous.
