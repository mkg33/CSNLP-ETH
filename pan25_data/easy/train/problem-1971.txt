Boycotting is not anywhere near as effective as government intervention.
You stop using plastic bags, but buy food at a festival that is served with a plastic fork, I boycott plastic forks but order food on delivery which is delivered in a plastic bag, our friend boycotts the festival and deliveroo but goes to a coffee shop to buy a latte with a paper straw meanwhile the employee throws a large plastic bottle of milk in the general waste.
Meanwhile all these people think they are boycotting plastic and feel good about it while a dozen other issues are overlooked such as co2 emissions for home deliveries, air quality in cities from car brake pads due to people driving, landfill issues due to batteries not being recycled properly after use, animal cruelty due to food manufacturers, harm to river eco systems from fast fashion production in third world countries, water shortages due to drink producers, food shortages due to farming patents, e-waste due to tech company right to repair violations, sea pollution due to fishing nets, wild life destruction due to mining, land slide increases due to deforestation, slavery due to exploitation of poor children in labour camps to manufacture everything you use...
I didnâ€™t explain it very well.
What I really want is to just bring my yeti different places and drink out of that thing (using restraint glassware for the transfer obviously).
I already carry it around with me at work like a security blanket so may as well take it to happy hour.
