I agree with you population levels are a concern.
Though, I find it more likely we go off world rather than drop population levels to such a low amount.
Culling is too horrific to plan out, but wars and climate change will factor into that.
Population control for babies leads to unsavory societal attitudes and is difficult to enforce on a large population that isn't from China.
All in all, unless something catastrophic happens, humans are likely to rock the multi-billion pop levels for awhile.
But anything we can implement that reduces the footprint cost of living per human would be a great boon.
More education and a better lifestyle also show an effect of having less kids, so lifting the masses out of poverty would be behooving of us.
EPA - Environmental Protection Agency.
Executive agency signed into action by President Nixon tasked with environmental protection matters.
Oh yeah, sure.
Let's just not implement the technology necessary for space travel but is also capable of eliminating countless animal deaths, a vast amount of green house gas emissions, creating a large amount of jobs, or the fact we can literally end world hunger.
