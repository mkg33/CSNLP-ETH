The conservative manifesto the world over.
Conservatives get power and blame all their fuck ups on liberal parties, take credit for all the good they've done, and purposely sabotage liberals while they're in power - rinse and repeat.
People still buy their garbage for some reason.
As a Canadian I couldn't really name more than a handful of big things the Cons have done in my lifetime - lowering the GST and introducing TFSAs I guess?
The Liberals gave us our constitution, legalized weed, legalized gay marriage, legalized the early stages of doctor assisted death, are working on giving us dental and pharmacare, kept us out of Iraq, kept the budget balanced into the early 2000s, signed the Kyoto protocol, gave us NAFTA, saw us solidly through a global pandemic with CERB and helped make sure we were one of the most vaccinated nations on earth and on and on.
The LPC has done a lot of shit wrong and poorly, but ten times out of ten I'd pick them over the conservatives.
