Seriously, the guy represents fucking Long Island.
Is there any part of the country that had more 9/11 victims per capita in 2001?
He's lucky this is coming out now, and not during an election season, because he'd have been nailed to a god damned cross for that.
And he should be.
It was previously discovered that his mother didn't die on 9/11, and that she likely wasn't an executive working in an office in the twin towers; Forward magazine is the publication posted here, they also broke the story about Santos' non-Jewish heritage, based on documents they obtained and examined.
The story posted here is more excellent journalism, examining Santos' mother's green card history, which illuminates many aspects of Santos' biography.
I'll also be the first to admit that I appear to be wrong about Santos' immigration status, based on what's in this article, he was likely born in Queens.
