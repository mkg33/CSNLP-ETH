Eg.
The US is protectionist in its trade and employs heavy tarifs, compared to countries like Australia, who have a free trade agreement with China and helped build large trade blocs together with them like RCEP and ASEAN.
.
There simply is not enough young Chinese people to replace all the ones currently working.
Their production will soon plummet.
Sure, every country commits espionage.
Every country denies it too.
But when someone brazenly flies a spy balloon over US territory, you can't expect them not to respond angrily.
They have to!
The public would perceive it as capitulation if they didn't.
Accusing them of hysteria isn't going to help either.
absolutely agree.
It isn't China starting this bullshit.
America did the math in 2008 and figured if Chinese had half the money Americans did, the American elite lose all their power.
The American elite control American politics like oligarchs.
So you have a small slice of American people.1%, whose interests are huge into starting some crap.
