The new (third attempt) procurement platform will go live around 2038, but will quickly become overwhelmed because of usability issues flooding their German only support lines (available M-W, 9:00-15:30 CET).
No it isn't.
Germany is supposed to be increasing its defense spending to 2% of its GDP per yer.
Scholz certainly gave the impression that was going to happen:
Then IT Contractors can fax over the procurement platform RFQ responses to the individual states' processing department, receipt of which will be confirmed in no more than 30 days via Deutsche Post (please make sure your address is up to date by securing an appointment at your local State Office no more than 28 days before your submission - appointments go fast, so log in at midnight to the appointment portal to see if there is any availability in March!
).
Also the headline is misleading as most people don't know or don't want to know because they can shit on germany - reality is that there are two different kinds of budgets - one federal and one special for military spending that circumvents certain rules for the federal budget - so a cut in the federal budget is to expected when there is a special budget already.
