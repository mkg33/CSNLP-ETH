"It's disgusting, man.
Disgusting that people still make the argument that we can never cut defense but we can cut education.
Who the fuck is going to invade the US?
Really?
Really?
Use your fucking heads The only country that could invade America is America We can afford to cut defense; we can't afford to cut education.
We cut education, in 50 years, we'll be so stack with idiots with shitty jobs that we won't have enough money to pay for defense!

The public benefits from maximizing efficiency of spending.
Our defense benefits from honest management in spending.
