I think there were different purposes though.
And I feel awful typing this out, but the Islamic Republic’s aim here is to create shock to the public, whereas the Nazi concentration camps weren’t exactly public and the point was much more about the execution itself.
There’s a terrible joke to made about German efficiency, but remember, Nazis were hell bent on a mission to do the most heinous shit to the most people; the less time they could spend on executions meant the more time they could spend doing other evil things.
But the spectacle of violence and cruelty is the point for the Islamic Republic.
I don’t actually expect they intend to use it for mass execution, at least at the moment (and that could always change), but the point seems to be to strike fear and bury that trauma deep inside the psyche of the Iranian people.
Ultimately, killing too many young people will be bad for them (population about 85M currently so it’s still technically a small number, but this can still effect things especially if they keep having to arrest people), especially if they remain as isolated from much of the rest of the world economy as they are today.
So they want the most shock per death.
Again, some of them likely enjoy the cruelty as well, but there is a practical matter here and this is a key reason why simply executing 15K protesters is a problem for the regime.
Horrific.
There is a deep difference between killing protestors in the streets or in detention by police and the death penalty issued by the state.
While the first one can be blamed on brutality of police and corruption of their morals, the second clearly states the intent of the state, a sanctioned policy.
It destroys a lot more institutions that could have stopped it, obviously like the court system.
