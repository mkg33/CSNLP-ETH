Yes there is - the posse comitatus act places significant limits on the federal military to enforce "domestic policy" (with the exception of the national guard of the various states and the coast guard).
Border security outside of wartime is considered the purview of domestic immigration authorities and other law enforcement agencies.
So your source is...a guy.
That is stupid enough to get caught, and worse to only come back with cash.
Regardless of whether border protection is a "national security consideration", it's also a domestic law enforcement mission.
Which means federal military are very limited in what they can do there - they can't make arrests, can't collect or process evidence, can't investigate or interrogate, can't secure crime scenes, can't direct traffic (that one always seemed weird to me, but whatever), lots of prohibitions.
They can't do anything that is normally a function exclusive to cops.
Really, all they seem to do is repair fences and watch video cameras... and then call Border Patrol to go try and catch people.
Federally-activated National Guard.
In other words, (which covers nationalized troops) rather than (state level NG).
Two separate sections of US Code, one covers active, federal, military (those covered by Posse Comitatus) and state militia (national guard) that is not.
This is how NG troops were used in GWOT, and deployed to Afghanistan.
