At time in our recent history- laws can be immoral and unjust.
The most recent example in the United States is the current recommended penalty for Cocaine Powder or paste versus Crack Cocaine ( power cocaine with an added step that allowed people to smoke).
The sentencing guidelines were written such that a segment of society guilty of possession ( Predominantly poor and at the time the law was drafted minority-African Americans ) currently receives a much greater penalty than the segment that is found guilty of powder possession ( at the time the law was drafted -Anglo Americans. )
case in point Tim Allen (American actor “the Santa Clause “ and pretty much considered a wholesome family friendly actor, in 1978 was caught with 650 Grams ( almost 1.5 lbs) of Cocaine - did two years in jail.
Case 2 to 5,000 - unknown “ Ralphs” arrested for possession and trafficking crack Cocaine first time arrest.
By the current federal guideline the judge must sentence to at least five years in prison.
The average jail time is 74 months (6 years).
Republicans just committed an organized failure of a coup and Biden's first priority is reestablishing the Republican and Democrat power sharing agreement.
Yup.
On a Saturday.
That is also Christmas Eve.
Can't make this shit up.
This will quietly be forgotten by New Years and the rest of us will still be wondering why justice was never served.
I'd love to be wrong here, but we all know this is what will happen.
And from January 3rd onward we won't have time to think about it because it's going to be two years of solid back to back hunter Biden investigations.
Maybe another Benghazi investigation for good measure.
I know.
It’s so frustrating.
Gotta stop building the wine cellar and curtail the grow tent to deal with this crap.
