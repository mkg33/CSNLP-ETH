I think everyone already hates Iran except Russia.
Meanwhile dealing with protests they decided to start arming the Russians.
Only Iran would think assisting in the murder of people 1000 miles away is a good response to protests over citizens treatment.
Israel.
They've been trying to sink any and every kind of deal in the region that would bring about any semblance of peace, just as much as countries like Iran have.
They even lied about murdering an American journalist recently.
They've proven themselves to be untrustworthy, so why should I give them any benefit of the doubt?
I wouldn't trust anything that comes from Iran, either, for similar reasons.
israeli intelligence is awesome.
the usa uses it all the time.
its a bunch of smart jews surrounded by arab countries that would love to take them out so this isnt shocking.
Precisely.
Itâ€™s shocking how naive people are to believe publicly stated misinformation.
If there was actionable intelligence, it would never be in the public domain until it was neutralized.
