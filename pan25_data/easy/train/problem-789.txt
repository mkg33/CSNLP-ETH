The Palestinian Authority promotes apartheid beliefs by making women second class citizens (same as Israelis making Palestinians Such) and willfully support the cleansing of homosexuals.
This can be said of the majority of Muslim states - Iran, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Yemen, Pakistan, etc.
Naa.
Maybe Israeli actions are contributing to antisemitism but it’s not antisemitism to point out that there are people out there who are being mistreated.
I don’t like Hamas but I’ve had this argument enough times and done enough research to know that Israelis started the conflict.
I’m not just talking about forcibly taking land, I’m talking about terroristic attacks.
Since when is fighting back against an attacker and oppressor “terrorism”?
There are plenty of incidents where Jewish people rightfully fought the Germans before and during WWII.
Does that make the Jewish people terrorists or heroes?
I say heroes.
