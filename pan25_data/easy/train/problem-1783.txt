Acid broke me out of a funk last summer that I'd been in for like 5 years.

Lol.
I mean, that isn't anything specific to Russia - almost any country you have citizenship of will, when you are in that country, treat you as a citizen and refuse any special treatment on the basis of having a second nationality.
