Red flag laws are utterly disgusting and contemptable.
A total nullification of the presumption of innocence, the right to arms, the right to property, the right to a trial before jury of your peers, and the right to face your accuser, all in one tyrannical package.
If someone did something bad enough to justify stripping them of their 2A rights and their property, then charge them with a crime, arrest them, have a trial in a court of law before a jury of their peers, convict them, and then you can do that.
So really we are talking about removing the rights of people who have committed no crime, who have not been arrested nor charged, for not even the suspicion of a crime, but the suspicion of maybe a potential future crime with zero evidence beyond hearsay, hearsay that the accused has no right to defend themselves against.
Good.
People with violent histories should raise a red flag.
Guns should have stricter laws.
They also should NOT, and are not, being banned.
