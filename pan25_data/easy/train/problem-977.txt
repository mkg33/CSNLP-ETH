Second, your historical example seems to claim that the two party system is actually good and could even prevents a civil war, but I don't see that line of argument.
You say it yourself, no one held a majority and that is where conflict arised.
But having close to no majority in a two party system so that every election becomes a coin toss and important reforms can't be archived with the necessary majority, you come to standstill, the same standstill mimicking that historical situation, and in recent years you can see that conflict already.
I mean, really.
Why don't they just tell their people they won, Ukraine is Russia, and all the Nazis are dead, mission accomplished.
At this point they're just spending money, ammo, and lives to try to make it slightly easier to sell a bullshit propaganda piece anyway.
So, just take all that energy and effort and invest it all in propaganda anyway.
Just lie their ass off.
But all the way.
Because bullshit was all it ever was anyway.
See?
Easy!
Natural resources are extracted from Siberia and the money directed to Russia's two major cities to be embezzled rather than being reinvested in Siberia.
See.
I kinda disagree.
First of all, I didn't say it can't work, I said it is destined to go bad.
That's a difference.
