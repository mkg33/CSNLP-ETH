MAD as an intelligible tactical strategy works off the threat of mutual destruction.
Once they've already landed nukes, MAD isn't really in the picture, MAD has failed it's real purpose of discouraging first launch and you are effectively already toast.
MAD in a post nuclear detonation scenario has run its course unless you are insane enough to consider destroying everything out of spite.
Instead now you are faced with the choice of retaliating and likely ending humanity in the subsequent launches, counter launches and counter counter launches or attempting to de-escalate and salvage the world.
Yes.
If the submarines try to contact the UK for something like 3 days in a row with no response then they are authorised to fire the nukes.
Thats just the dead man's trigger response, of course.
They can also fire immeditely if ordered to by the government.
There's actually surprisingly little radiation from modern nuclear weapons as they detonate above targets to maximise impact rather than hitting the ground and spewing comtaminated material into the air.
