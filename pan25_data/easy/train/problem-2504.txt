Inflation is high and out economy is down because we keep giving ridiculous amount of money to Ukraine, devaluing our American currency, also effecting others around the world.
So is giving millions and billions of dollars to Ukraine isn't negatively effecting our economy and inflation?
Inflation affects thr economy, they go together.
And so if Trump didn't give him rockets, how?
Russia attacked after Bidin became president, no longer Tump's issue.
And some would argue that Trump is what kept Putin at bay, just like Kim Jong-Un.
Trump kept Putin at bay the entire time, like what he did with Kim Jun-Un.
It was until Biden wasn't being as strict as Trump the Putin saw a opening.
Totally incorrect.
The money that is going to Ukraine isn't going directly.
It is going to procure arms from US manufacturers and put 100000 US troops in Europe.
That money is spent domestically and is part of the overall budget.
