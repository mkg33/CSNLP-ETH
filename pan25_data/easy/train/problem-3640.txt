I’m from El Salvador and I was kidnapped by the ms 13 .
I would say fuck them, they are reason I had to break my university studies.
They target poor people who only want to make some money.
Do you have a new small business or restaurant?
Bad!
They come to you ask you for money and if you don’t pay they either kill you or kill one of your love ones.
They feel cool having some authority.
The police used to arrest them back in the days but they didn’t have proof that they made crimes, so they have to let them go, once they were again free they started to do shit again.
Now, police have the records of who was previously arrested but this time they go straight to jail.
If you walk now in El Salvador is more secure than before, I even brought my German girlfriend there and was all good.
So yeah, I’m happy about it.
"The authorities’ campaign of mass, indiscriminate arrests has led to the detention of hundreds of people with no apparent connections to gangs’ abusive activity.
In many cases, detentions appear to be based on the appearance and social background of the detainees, or on questionable evidence, such as anonymous calls and uncorroborated allegations on social media.
".
El Salvador's government moved thousands of suspected gang members to a newly opened "mega prison" on Friday, the latest step in a controversial crackdown on crime that has caused the Central American nation's prison population to soar.
Well said.
The greater good of the people should always come before the highest corporate bidders that control politicians through lobbying.
Maybe one day we’ll see a utilitarian shift here at home as well, but who knows.
