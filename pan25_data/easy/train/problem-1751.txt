If the population is accepting but their leaders are not, I figure that brings up at least two notable issues.
First of all that leadership is the one implementing policies so that means a heck of a lot more than simple opinions.
And second, if said leadership has been in charge for as long as they have, on some level that suggests that the population is willing to ignore their stances on trans issues (or has been swayed) in favor of other issues they deem to be more important.
Now, if things were better in the past then maybe that makes sense.
All I know is that in recent history - much like the US - my impression is that the UK has become increasingly transphobic due to culture war bullshit.
That goes for pop figures like JK Rowling too, I believe?
I was going to mention Graham Linehan but it turns out that's not a recent phenomenon.
In many multi-party parliamentary democracies, "forming a government" refers to the various parties coming together to create a governing coalition.
When there is an impasse in doing so, it is often said that a country has "no government" or that the government has "collapsed".
