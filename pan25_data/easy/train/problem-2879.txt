The Pope welcomed baby killing pro-abortion Nancy Pelosi but dismisses a bishop who supported a President who was on the same other side of the issue.

Notmypope.
You'd think his supporters would have noticed this by now.
He's a conman, a vampire of money, reputation, career, and sanity.
He'll wring all of those out of you, and then throw you away, moving on to his next victim.
In his business deals, he gets his cut up front, then stiffarms contractors wanting to get paid, commits tax fraud to shelter more money, and then doesn't give a shit as the project collapses into bankruptcy, wiping out the "investors" who were dumb enough to trust him or customers foolish enough to think the Trump name stood for anything beyond a tacky, gold-plated scam.
