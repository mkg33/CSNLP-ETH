Yeltsin was a criminal of the same vein as Putin.
The genocide of the Chechen people was massively ignored by the world and any democratic institutions which could hope to sprout were decimated during his second elections, all driven by the fear of communists.
Wagner OTOH is on that kind of scale.
The degree of separation between Wagner and Putin is incredibly thin.
They're directly tapped into the Russian military supply chain because the leaders are a part of the Russian military.
And their position as a "grey" market soldier is used because it provides plausible deniability for the Russian government.
And the Russian government has a degree of seperation when leaders order Wagner to execute unruly Russian soldiers.
Wagner has different levels of soldiers ranging from hired brutes culled from prisons to elite trained and equipped soldiers.
Which apparently is not on par with NATO elite soldiers.
Exactly.
How else can they have their own tanks, fighter aircraft, helicopters, guided missiles etc.
