They really thought their "lets go brandon" was so clever and would trigger the left, instead it was largely ignored and the GQP have put all their chips on willful ignorance and/or weaponized idiocy.
The GQP didn't even do any healthcare reform in the 4 years they ran the place even though every two weeks they said the plan was around the corner.
Many Conservatives I know desperately need healthcare and they still voted against their own interests, in an attempt to 'own the libs'.
Truly concerning and embarrassing how much the right wing propaganda machine works.
Skepticism is understandable.
But Mueller ultimately reported to Trump and Senate Republicans ignored the evidence in covering for Trump during the impeachments.
The fix was in for all of those previous attempts to hold him accountable.
Seriously.
I know people, including me, are anxious to see some small measure of justice done but this is unprecedented.
Of course they arenâ€™t just going to launch immediately into an indictment like with Reality Winner.
