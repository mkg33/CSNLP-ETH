My understanding is that any country with a nuke power plant is going to have waste material that they can make a bomb out of, but delivering it at a fast enough speed that American defense systems can't knock it out of the sky sounds pretty hard.
Hi.
Author of the OPEN-RISOP here.
I'm a former SIOP advisor who also was in the intelligence community.
I suspect that most of the Russian ICBMs and SLBMs are targeted against the United States.
The Russians would most likely use their "sub-strategic" nuclear weapons (cruise missiles, air-to-ground missiles, and gravity bombs) to hold European and Asian targets at risk.
Just my two cents.
So, what you're saying to me, is that the Western inspectors would know so much more about how Soviet and post Soviet rockets work, that they would be able to identify massive flaws in the entire Russian strategic rocket fleet and keep those flaws secret from the massive entirety of the highly skilled experts on the Russian end, on the off chance that the Russians wouldn't identify these threats and when they went to use them, the rockets wouldn't work?
Which is fair.
You can't afford to let a rift be sown between the two biggest forces in beating the Axis.
Even if Stalin was a bad guy, he wasn't Hitler.
If Britain had their way, many more people would have died.
