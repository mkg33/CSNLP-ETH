The original purpose was to protect militias from federal overreach.
That is clear from the text of the amendment and the history shows that the anti-federalists were concerned about the proposed Constitution's grant of authority to Congress to arm and discipline the state militias.
At the framing, no one in any of the ratification debates talked about guns for personal protection vs. criminals.
But like all our constitutional rights, the Second Amendment has evolved over time.
Beginning the early 1800s, the meaning of the right to bear arms began to shift towards personal defense against criminals -- a result of the decline of the militias and changes in gun technology.
It is clear that the farmers of the 14th amendment, adopted after the Civil War, did view the 2A as an individual right that had to be applied to the states.
Homicide is likely more related to poverty, education, opportunity, etc.
rather than just access to guns, which is certainly a factor, but also not the only factor.
