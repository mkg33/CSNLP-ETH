Absolutely.
I grew up in California, and it just didn’t feel like my vote mattered.
I knew the results before Election Day, and I wasn’t tuned into national politics at that point.
Now I live in a completely red area, and I vote out of spite.
Unilateral disarmament is handing Republicans congress.
Either we ban gerrymandering federally or we do it as aggressively as they are.
If I sound angry about this it's for a reason.
I live in Nashville and the TN GOP just gerrymandered Nashville's blue district and split us into 3 MAGA districts and now we're represented by stop the steal Republicans.
Dems cast 35% of votes in TN but only have 1 district out of 9.
They are now likely going to hold onto the house because Dems believe in playing fair while they kick us below the belt.
