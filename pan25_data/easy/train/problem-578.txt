To the OP: NATO is not further encouraging Russian behavior.
NATO should not respond as Russia does because we are better than that.
You are asking for direct NATO involvement and your comment is stoping well short of a full analysis of what would happen.
You are asking for an extensive escalation.
This isn't Afghanistan or Iraq, this is a nuclear power.
NATO would present an existential threat to Russian Leadership.
NATO exists to protect NATO territories to avoid encroachment by Russia into NATO land.
Unfortunately, Ukraine is not in NATO.
It is the job of all the worlds major powers to avoid world war III, and they are toeing the line of it as far as they can without encroaching into it.
Incorrect.
Those products are produced regardless of whether they are used, because they need to be available on standby.
Sending them to Ukraine does not increase the spending on that production.
Escalating what?
The Ukrainians want the Russian rapists, thieves and murderers out of their land.
They're giving their lives to the freedom of their people and we're giving them a chance to fight.
