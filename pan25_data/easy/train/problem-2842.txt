Right, it's an easy way to keep Ukrainians on board with the government by making it seem they are all about to die all the time, instead of rethinking their support of the revolutionary junta in kiev and its obsession with keeping Eastern Ukraine and expelling all the Russian speakers.
No.
It’s normal flights of aircraft in Belarus.
It happens regularly just like in every other country with their military.
We get notified of the alarm only being for aircraft and not for an attack in Ukraine.
Someone just posted this with out context.
The northern Ukrainian border is currently littered with land mines any invasion from the north would be very costly in terms of lives and belarus only has about 10000 combat ready soldiers which are significantly worse in terms of training compared to Russia Lukashenko loses these troops he has bo defense against partisans and protesters and will be overthrown within days.
Yes.
Just didn’t go into the specifics.
It’d be nice if they could have two different alerts at least rather than the alarm and then telling us later it’s not an important one.
Like one for a threat and one for an actual attack.
