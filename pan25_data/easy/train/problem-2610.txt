They'll be like Russia where they are a constant brake on any progress.
Like how they are demanding that the rest of the world pays for their renewables or they'll build coal power plants.
In spite India being filled with some of the worst smog filled cities in the world.
And it having a renewable industry that can create energy more cheaply than through fossil fuels.
They don't have the geopolitical influence of Russia or economic influence of China yet.
But their orthogonal self-interest is as clear as day.
They chose to increase trade with Russia as Russia is causing a global economic recession.
They are a security threat.
They are relishing in this economic collapse so much that they are literally taking actions that will prolong it.
Building up the Indian economy and becoming dependent on it for our own needs is just setting ourselves up for the same issues we have created in post-soviet Russia with Putin and China's imperialist ventures in Hong Kong and Taiwan.
How about instead of propping up yappy dog states in exchange for their cheap labour we start working on sustainable local economies that won't try and sabotage us with hostile economics a decade down the line.
Yes?
Indian politicians themselves have been asking to stop aid?
Especially forcing NGOs to document their foreign aid.
But then you guys cried it as authoritarianism lol.
