Same kinda thing happened to me in high school.
Our beloved biology teacher was also the football coach, after an away football game (an hour away) the bus was no where to be seen to take us home.
The bus driver decided he didnâ€™t want to wait, in early November, in the rain, in Michigan.
We waited an hour and a half outside for the bus.
When the driver showed up, the coach went absolutely haywire on the bus driver.
We learned the following Monday our coach/ teacher was fired for his outburst.
We planned a walkout, the teachers tried to stop us, the principal was taking names and threatening expulsions, we held firm, 2 days of showing up at school and refusing to enter the building he got his job back and retired as a teacher from that school (years later).
When cancer caught him his funeral was held in the gymnasium and it was packed, he was a great guy, great coach, great community leader in our small town.

I was wondering why the ones most affected by this stupidity were so quiet.
The students are rightfully upset.
This type of educational censorship has no place in this 21st century.
