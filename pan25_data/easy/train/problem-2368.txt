The SNP want to make Scotland a nation state once again.
Right now there is only one nation state in that entire area, a nation called the UK.
Are Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland nation states?
No, they have not been since 1707.
They are now regions inside the UK.
For sentimental reasons we've decided to call those regions "countries" due to their history.
We can call them countries if we want, but it's misleading as the general public use the term country when they mean nation state.
Country has no legal basis.
We can call them flippity floppity flutes if we wanted to and it mean the same.
Westminster â‰  England.
At least not legally.
There is no devolved English government that only represent the English.
The Scottish Parliament is not sovereign.
It's only existed since 1999 due to Westminster deciding to devolve some of its powers regarding Scotland to Holyrood under the Scotland Act 1998.
But ultimately the Scottish Parliament derives all its powers and legitimacy to an act of the UK Parliament.
The UK Parliament can repeal the Scotland Act if they had enough votes.
