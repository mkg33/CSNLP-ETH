If they bring the government down and crash the economy on the heads of the poor and what’s left of the middle class, and strip Medicare and Social Security, there will be nowhere for them to hide.
That will trigger a civil war.
There are a lot of aging Gen X’ers, and middle-aged Millennials hitting their 40s now, that have paid a good chunk of change into the Social Security system at this point.
Many of whom who know they will have nothing but Social Security, when time comes, because everything is so goddamn expensive you can’t save money anymore.
With no economy to work in, basic necessities like food and housing skyrocketing overnight from a possible rapid deflation nightmare scenario as a result, and you take Medicare and Social Security away?
That’s a “nothing to lose” situation for a lot of folks.
Republicans want to strangle the government and shrink it, but I don’t think they’re going to like the result as much as they think they will.
