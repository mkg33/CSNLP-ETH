I think someone else’s bid to address deaths by country is more interesting: generally if you kill a reporter it’s to stop information getting out or being collected which would be pretty gender neutral, where by country would give you an indication of what countries are heavily involved in censorship.
Yep.
News media constantly pat itself on the back, and take glory from a tiny portion of journalists that take actual risks and paints the entire industry with the glory of their work.
Most of the journalists aren't putting their lives on line, most of the journalists ignore important and relevant News and pump out cheap news that gets clicks/retweets.
Journalists and editors are also responsible for curating news, manipulating story, pumping out headlines that grab attention and distorts the truth.
Most of the journalists, are too busy selecting news that fit their readers viewpoints, using their wild imagination to create headlines, use all of their education to pump in opinions in news, all to get more clicks/retweets/subscription.
