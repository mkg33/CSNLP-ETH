The actions of China recently are very concerning, there illegal police stations in other countries, their takeback of Hong Kong before the agreement was over, fears of them invading Taiwan, their leader being sworn in for life, the comments about the UK's response to the Chinese diplomats kidnapping a Hong Kong protestor was very disturbing, the list goes on.

They have more people, so of course, their emissions in totality are going to be more than most countries.
That is why you look at it in per capita.
Maybe if the US actually helped with renewable technologies manufacturing instead of, y'know, freezing out semiconductors?
What are we talking about then?
Why are we talking about China?
Were we not talking about Chinaâ€™s emissions?
Is it not useful to compare their emissions relative to the rest of the world?
What better way to do that than to compare it to a country that a lot of people on Reddit live in?
Fucking idiot.
