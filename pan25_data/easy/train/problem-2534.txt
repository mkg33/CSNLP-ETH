Ukrainian individual troop morale is better.
If you tell Ukrainian troops "Hey we need you guys to split off and go man the trenches over there instead of all cramming into this one big building", they'll do it.
Troops with bad morale are much more likely to say "fuck you, we're drinking in here, try and make us".
Supreme overconfidence and disbelief.
Early on Ukraine also wasn't great at dispersing their forces and made easy pickings for Russian strikes, but they learned quickly.
Meanwhile Russia is still using their good old approach of "Just because it didn't work the first 30 times doesn't mean it won't work on the 31st".
Besides its just more internal propaganda rotting their war effort, since admitting Ukranians can target that far with HIMARs that were supposed to be destroyed three times over is not something any career vatnik is going to do.
Well.
They probably ordered them built.
Ukrainian engineers and workers would have done most or all of the work, at the behest of the Soviet government.
