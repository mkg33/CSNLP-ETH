The generic party vote is likely to end up around Rep +2%, but them only taking +1% of the House seats.
There were more uncontested Republicans than Democrats and where Republicans did solidly better than expected was in areas where they either still didn't win or they were already expected to win.
It’s 7pm PST.
I’m looking on NYT and seeing Democrats pretty much on track to win 20 seats, not counting the Cali seats that I feel like it’s too early to tell.
If Dems can get 4 additional seats (AZ 1, AZ 6, CA 3, CA 13, CA 22, CA 41, CA 45?, haha CO 3), they get control of the House.
Is this feasible or even being discussed?
Is there actually a world where Dems get all 3?
Yes, catastrophe barely avoided.
I think people are not realizing that we actually just saw a blue wave.
It wasn't a red tsunami, wave, or trickle.
It was a blue wave that started from a deficit and fought it's way back up.
