Story from my coworker about Vietnam.
He and his buddy didn't want to get drafted and the branch with the lowest deployment rate at the time was the Navy.
So a ton of people joined the Navy including my coworker and his buddy.
His buddy felt good about not getting deployed because he also had an English degree because he wanted to be an English teacher, that's useless to the military right?
Well they wanted to build schools and teach the Vietnamese english, so guess who got sent to Vietnam?
Meanwhile my coworker did not.
But not all countries are like this, i am also against conscription in times of war but the government first priority is the country and without conscription they will very likely just collapse and fall (similar to Britain, china and the soviets in ww2, without conscription they would likely not exist today).
Nope.
I will not be doing that.
I am just as valuable as any other human.
No person is more valuable than any other.
If my government tried to draft me I would refuse outright.
Put me in prison, kill me, idk.
I would rather do any of that than fight for a country that thinks it’s ok to violate my rights and force me to fight against my will.
That’s not a country worth fighting for.
It's utterly ridiculous.
Random people being drafted didn't choose to fight the war.
No one has the right to force anyone to harm, fight, or kill and any thought otherwise is a serious problem to humanity.
