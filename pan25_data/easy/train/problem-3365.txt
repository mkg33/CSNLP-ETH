That's not accurate.
It's more effective to use conventional explosives since 1.
You'll be able to control the damage better and 2.
You won't have just irradiated your new front line.
Nukes are really only viable if you need to unbuild a large city in a strategically and economically unimportant location.

Ukranian war propaganda ?
You mean news of Russian atrocities right ?
You do understand that Russia invaded a sovereign country, in fact did that already in 2014 at which point "the west" made the mistake of appeasing Putin.
Mistake which Ukraine is paying with blood, the world with economic downturn and Russia with the future of their younger generation.
