ITT: People across the world woefully unaware of the Dutch nitrogen crisis, it's relation to the Dutch housing crisis, the relative amount of nitrogen emitted by farms, and the percentage of food that we're not even producing for ourselves.
WHY?
If you lower your food production, somewhere else will pick up the slack, and the total nitrogen produced will be the same.
You even admit as much in your last paragraph.
Earlier in the year the government came out with a map about where they planned to reduce farming businesses that emit nitrogen, but forgot to give any nuances, so the farmers (and people that support them) got the impression that in some places 70% of farms would be forcefully appropriated by the government (with the implicit notion that they would not get full reimbursement), resulting in protests and small-scale riots using dangerous farm-equipment to force their way.
Resulting in a split in society with on one side the environmentalists and the regions with big population centers (Called the ‘Randstad), and on the other side the ones working for or owning agricultural businesses and the more ‘rural’ regions that have a lot of farming.
1.
75% of produced food in the Netherlands is being exported, and they are the second-largest exporter of agricultural products in the world.
So yes, easily.
And this concerns mostly livestock farming, which is not even a necessity.
