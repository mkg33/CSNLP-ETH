An okay 2br townhome (so, not on land of its own just like a condo with maybe a garage for your reference) house sells for $400K.
A 20% down payment on that is $80K.
A 5% downpayment on that is $20K.
Housing goes up 10% a year (on average, over the last decade in the US - my state is like 13% a year over the decade).
So, next year you have a $440K house with a down payment minimum of $22,000.
You were able to save $2400 in the year - which assumes nothing bad happened all year, but your down payment required to purchase a house of your own just went up $2000 in that same year.
So, you progressed $400 towards your goal of home ownership.
And next year, your pay went up maybe 3% but your rent went up 10% so you're able to save less money than the year prior, not more.
Actually.
Where I am, many police officers are not paid well.
Though, there’s more of a problem in my state’s department of corrections and department of juvenile justice.
Constantly hiring more prison guards.
And the juvie near me actually had a riot back in October.
Struggling to recruit and retain people.
