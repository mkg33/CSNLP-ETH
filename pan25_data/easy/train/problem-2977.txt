A canary trap is a method for exposing an information leak by giving different versions of a sensitive document to each of several suspects and seeing which version gets leaked.
It could be one false statement, to see whether sensitive information gets out to other people as well.
Special attention is paid to the quality of the prose of the unique language, in the hopes that the suspect will repeat it verbatim in the leak, thereby identifying the version of the document.
Not necessarily.
There were plans drawn up but that's what any competent military does (not that they actually are one).
America, for example, has plans for how to invade literally every country on Earth.
Not out of maliciousness, but strategically, it's better to have some sort of plan to work from if you need one.
Never know when an ally might get invaded and you need to save them ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
Absolutely.
I have no doubt they have plans on how they would invade New Zealand, if nothing more than as a thought exercise etc.
But the current anti-Russia fervour is payday for cretins like Newsweek and Daily Mail.
