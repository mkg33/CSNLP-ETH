It's been awhile since I looked but I had an studio for $400... that was in a not so nice neighborhood.
Even if the Christians are folks who support economic policy to help the poor and workers, effective climate policy, and social policy that protects women's right to choose, protects women, racial minorities and LGBT people from discrimination, supports humane immigration laws and civil liberties, and supports a secular state?

The Catholic church hierarchy is far from a bastion of liberalism but isn't nearly as conservative as the religious right in the USA wishes, and Catholics also tend to be a swing vote with around half of the religion in the US being rather to the left (even socially) of the church hierarchy itself.
Of course there's still also the conservative wing of the membership rank and file, and plenty of them align with the us religious right too.
But there can definitely be more diversity among that religion than some acknowledge.
