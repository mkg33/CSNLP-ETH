In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Exactly.
If being "blamed" gets them elected anyway, then they have every incentive to keep sabotaging the republic.
They literally staged the first putsch in the history of the nation and instead of expelling the members responsible, they embraced them and expelled the members who criticized them.
And they still won control of the House.
White supremacy is political teflon.
Played ball how?
Outlawed abortion or banished all LBTQ people.
Or how about if they cancelled social security and Medicare.
Perhaps they could kick out all the muslims and bring back slavery.
No wait I know, they could help privatize education.
Maybe if they just went ahead and abolished all labour laws and gave corporations control of the natural resources.
Or they could help the GOP stop taxing the rich people and get all the poor people to pay the taxes required to fund the military.
And finally to really play ball, cancel all elections and appoint the republicans to elected positions.
Then maybe, and I say this with all sincerity, if they did all that the GOP would vote to raise the debt ceiling.
But they still probably wouldnâ€™t if it was the Democrats wanting to raise it.
