The label “neocon” applies to people like Willam Kristol, who had been a democrat.
They believe in big government, they just want it to pursue conservative aims.
“Neo” means new.
As far as I know, Carlson has been conservative his entire life.

and I heard it just the other day, you had Tucker Carlson, who has treated us very fairly if we're being honest about it, and he said that I'm the World Champion, World Champion can you believe it, here we had so many good things under Trump and now under Sleepy Joe we're in a Total Wasteland.
you have, and when I say this I say it with a great respect, a great great respect, but we had it perfect when I was in charge, incredibly perfect, incredibly good, nobody's ever seen better, you look at Honest Abe, Abe Lincoln, he had The Hat, and he looked pretty Presidential, not as much as me, but a lot, and don't forget our Economy was in Overdrive, our Beautiful DOW, it was up many many millions, but now Sleepy Joe is letting Kamalah and Pocahontas run it into the ground, it's horrible what they're doing.
remember, we would've never even had a Military if it wasn't for me, and they're coming up to me, our Beautiful Soldiers, our Strong Strong Marines, coming up, tears in their eyes, "thank you, Sir, thank you for saving our Constitution and saving our Marriages," and I said it's not a problem.
ok, you can say thank you, money is better, but thank you is ok too.
you're lucky to have me.
