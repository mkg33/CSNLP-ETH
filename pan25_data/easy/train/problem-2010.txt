Wasn’t he always associated with mafia bosses in New York, the Republican Party will become like Putin’s mobster state sponsored administration like it was denying the election loss of 2020, not getting his taxes released, mafia bosses get special favours while corrupting all of government like he did, a return of a presidential candidate with mafia connections will be interesting the second time around as he places people’s heads on the chopping block.
I will bet he won’t be charged also because it will not connect to him, as they fall from windows and commit suicide.
Something to look to forward to.
What really happened is that he made the casino issue loans to his other businesses to such an extent that the casino (casinoS plural- as he did this three times at least) could no longer afford its own obligations and had serious cash flow issues causing them to be insolvent.
But all that initial money didn’t come from him in the first place- it was all from outside investors in the casinos and banks loans to the casinos so he literally just essentially stole all the money from one company (the casino- and by extension investors and banks) and put it into his other companies.
That’s sinister, not incompetence (which again, I think is even worse).
