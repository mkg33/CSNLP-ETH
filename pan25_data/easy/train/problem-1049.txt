They are?
That’s fucked up.
Here in Costa Rica government employees use strikes for everything.
And it works.
Primary school teachers union wants something?
Strike.
2 days later, secondary school teachers (high school) teachers join the strike to support them.
Next day the electric power National company ( electricity is nationalized here since like 90 years ago) join them.
A few hours later the port authority employees (also government) join.
The small country comes to a halt.
The government is forced to sit down and negotiate.
At agreement is made.
Rinse and repeat every few years.
It works…how do I know it works?
Government employees have waaaaaaaaaay more perks than private ones.
Yes some of these are abusive but those normally get stricken out by courts, but in general public servants by the force of their unions, have it better.
Private unions are not illegal but they hardly exist because, well, private owners destroy them before they even start to exist .
Un-fucking-believable.
Biden just slapped the workers that helped elect him in the face.
Really hoping he doesn't run in '24 now.
This won't bode well for Democrats.
