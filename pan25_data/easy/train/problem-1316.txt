It’s not his fucking job to decide what laws are legal or not.

As far as I've seen the term when used in conjunction with abortion is simply talking about cities that are in pro-choice states that will be having to service out-of-state patients, and they have no obligation to inform or help the abortion-ban states enforce their abortion laws with regard to those patients.
Just like immigration sanctuary cities have no obligation to inform or help federal government enforce federal immigration laws.
How so?

Elaborate.
They/them had mental health issues judging from previous issues like bomb threats reported.
They/them did not receive help and red flag laws already on the books in Colorado were not enforced.
