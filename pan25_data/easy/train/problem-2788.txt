Would be nice if we could focus on the more important systemic background problems that lead to gun crime.
Wonder how much violent crime would go down when instead of being pushed to join street gangs, kids/teens werent living in poverty and food scarcity and were able to get a quality education no matter what district they lived in.
I wonder how much gun related suicides would go down if we had a universal healthcare system that gave everybody access to mental healthcare services and prescriptions instead of letting them fall further and further through the cracks.
Wonder how much domestic violence related cases and homicides would drop because of the same?
Would probably help as well if there was a living wage and affordable housing and a better social safety net for when those things aren't available.
How about if we had better judicial and prison systems that focused on rehabilitation instead of forced slave labor and churning out repeat offenders?
