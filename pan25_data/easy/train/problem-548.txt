So even when we're in a position to get her out of the Senate she'll still be doing her best to mess the Democrats over.
What's terrible to me is that she makes Manchin look half-decent.
You can say a lot about him, you can say he's a oil baron tycoon, you can say he's a DINO, but AT LEAST HE'S STILL A DINO.
Kyrsten did this move just to screw the Democrats over and it's becoming clear it's her modus operandi.
It probably was the whole time.
I'd almost say she was a Republican plant, but more insidiously this is probably some big corp's efforts and we'll never know who exactly, we can only guess based on what job she gets when she's inevitably ousted from Congress.
Post-senatorial gigs.
That gets under my skin.
A public service job should not be a stepping stone to some exorbitantly lucrative job in the private sector.
Anyone here actually from Arizona?
Why did people vote for her in the first place?
I thought she supported a bunch of republican priorities when she was in the state legislature.
