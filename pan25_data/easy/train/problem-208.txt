In any event, this was an interesting discussion, however it appears to boil down to “Asian Americans are over represented in CA schools and they receive more Pell grants than proportional to their presence in the population… that’s still discrimination and if AA comes back those advantages might go away which would be bad for Asian Americans” compared with “once these bills go through it no longer is possible to determine if discrimination is occurring because the bills legally prevent gathering that information”.
Perhaps you’re willing to trust the conservative white groups driving these bills to not turn around and say “hey, white people are now at a disadvantage to Asian Americans, that’s not fair”.
I’m, respectfully, not exactly sure where that trust comes from given how they reacted to the Asian American community during Covid but perhaps your trust is better founded.
Perhaps conservative white politicians will not be racist to Asian Americans _this_ time.
I suppose we better hope so because if the lawsuit wins we won’t really be able to get the information to tell either way.
