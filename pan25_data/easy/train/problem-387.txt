This conflict was absolutely atrocious.
All major combatants (Tigrayan forces, Ethiopian military, and Eritrean military) are responsible for large-scale, widespread atrocities/human rights violations (mass rape, induced famine, indiscriminate murder of civilians, etc).

Again, they are not our responsibility.
They are their own problem.
Are you offering to spend \YOUR\ money and \YOUR\ life to end these evils?
Nothing is stopping you from going over there and fighting against these evils.
Stop demanding we spend our treasury and young on fighting their problems over there.
Totally!
I mean I am from the Bay Area and I have met many from the region.
Especially from both sides .
Ethiopians and Eritreans.
How they describe their time living there are sad.
Are you fucking historically illiterate?
Japan literally bombed the US, and Germany openly declared war on the US afterwards.
What were we supposed to do, just let the Japanese kill our POWs, bomb naval forces, and just say "Cheerio chaps, not very nice of you lads to bomb us.
Please do stop, we don't want war with you"?
What a shit comparison man.
What’s happening in Ethiopia?
The best most of us can do is some “well this is probably because colonial practices somehow” but otherwise it’s lost in the sordid generational conflict that has defined many places in Africa.
The coups and clashes so numerous that Westerns have lost the thread entirely.
