I've heard that westerners always get sick in India their first time.
Knew a guy who was 1st generation Americam born Indian.
Went over for a couple months in his 20's and was bed ridden for for the entire 3rd week.
A cousin nursed him the entire time.
He's a sax player and went over for inspiration for an album.
Aakash Mittal Quartet.
They're on Spotify.
Videsh is the album he wrote on that trip and he dedicated a 12 tone row to that sickness.
This isn't an argument against overpopulation.
Just because that many people can survive in a place in the immediate moment doesn't mean it's sustainable.
SK is also overpopulated, a lot of Europe is overpopulated, NYC is overpopulated.
No?
Great, then they can and should continue as the please.
The nation has a right to progress through the stages of economic development just as every developed nation before it.
Are you going to fork over the trillions of dollars needed for the country to bypass the industrial stage of development entirely?
Are you going to fund them to replace their factories with clean ones, at your own cost?
