I heard that russian missiles flying to Kiyv... Wouldn't it be fair that Ukrainians missiles would fly to Moscow?
Everywhere?
It was dropped from the US Common Core, but more than 20 states have laws/regulations that require it be taught.
And in case you need reminding, other countries exist.
It's still part of the curriculum in my country, for example.
“Don’t listen to the “propaganda” that says Ukraine isn’t attacking Russian civilians, listen to this very-reliable-information which justifies Russian aggression against their neighbor (and its civilians) with unsubstantiated claims that they are attacking Russian civilians!”.
Its longer in the air and bigger.
And Ukraine does double or Triple Tap where they can to be Safe.
Seems reasonable.
FFS nuclear weapons is so Fucken cheating... Like literally Rashist can do what ever they want to Ukraine... For example try to destroy electricity, heating and etc...
Meanwhile if Ukraine would try to do something like that to Russia, Ukraine probably would be nuked...
This is bullshit... World should really do something about this issue... Or there should be some sort agreement that each non nuclear county must be protected with nukes by country having them (so more NATO type alliances, I guess), or then nukes for every country (which would be terrible)... And 3rd option is probably de nuke the world, what is not possible, because there is at least few countries which have nukes and won't give them by any cost...
