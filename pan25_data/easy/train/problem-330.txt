That and the fact that historic foreign interventions in countries like Afghanistan and even Haiti(see the US' initial colonization project in the 1910's) always leads to some corporate entity to slime their tendrils in to extract value from the country.
There will be ample fat contracts for private firms to provide construction, resource extraction, and security services in such a situation.
Just by occupying a place you will allow for some amount of colonization efforts to take hold.
Furthermore I cannot see any foreign state actor looking to get involved in Haiti without wanting something to sweeten the deal.
What's Central America's overall military capabilities?
Could they try to form some kind of coalition effort?
The Ukrainians universally appreciated the US help.
While if the US was to help in this, the second you get dead Haitians in the street due to the US intervention youâ€™ll a have complete shitshow.
Not to mention all it would take to turn Haitians against the US would be a picture of a single white American soldier getting deployed.
