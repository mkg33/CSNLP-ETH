Yes she is which makes her even more dangerous to the trans community.
She is a transmedicalists which means she believes those who don’t take HRT and don’t experience Dysphoria and don’t get gender reassignment surgery aren’t trans, and being trans herself and a conservative she can convince GOP lawmakers to put up even larger boundaries and further gatekeep trans people from accessing medical care they need.
Ouch.
How selfish can people be?
It’s not about them Every parent should want their child to be happy.
I’m sorry you’re facing such difficulty.
I hope your transition is going better in other places though.
Good luck!
I’m rooting for you.
Legislators debating bills and legislation is not damaging to any communities.
Repugnant and even wrong opinions are still protected speech.

Silence offensive debate by legislators?
I feel that.
Started low dose experiment in May, went full dose in September and now I’m full timing as a girl at 7.5 total months of HRT with the changes coming along nicely and my T properly suppressed.
