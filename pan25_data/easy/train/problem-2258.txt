Honestly, I just saw you asking the same question a few times and gave a few answers.
Now, being serious, I don't think an exact percentage is the best answer.
Ideally, it would be something like a minimum amount plus a percentage that increases the more net worth a person has.
Otherwise £100 is like 10 hours of minimum wage work vs 103 seconds it would take richi to make it assuming a 1% return on his net worth for just sitting in a savings account.
Even doing that isn’t necessarily equitable.
Imagine handing a billionaire a 50% income fine.
Would that hurt?
Almost certainly, but at the end they still have hundreds of millions of dollars.
They’re still impacted far less by that fine than someone who’s struggling to put food on the table who gets fined $100.
Exactly.
A $100 fine can be a big deal to someone living on the edge of poverty, but can be virtually nothing to someone else.
The more money you have / earn, the higher the fine should be so it's somewhat of an equal deterrent for everyone.
Percentages aren’t inheritabtly equitable either.
Losing say, 10% of your daily wage has a much bigger impact on someone who doesn’t have much to begin with.
