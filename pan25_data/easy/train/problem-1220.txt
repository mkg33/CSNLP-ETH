'Even during the last years of Reconstruction, Democrats used paramilitary insurgents and other activists to disrupt and intimidate Republican freedman voters, including fraud at the polls and attacks on their leaders.
The electoral violence culminated in the Democrats regaining control of the state legislatures and passing new constitutions and laws from 1890 to 1908 to disenfranchise most blacks and many poor whites.
They also imposed Jim Crow, a combination of legal and informal segregation acts that made blacks second-class citizens, confirming their lack of political power through most of the southern United States.
The social and economic systems of the Solid South were based on this structure, although the white Democrats retained all the Congressional seats apportioned for the total population of their states.

Contemporary 21st century American "conservativism" is conservative in name only, it advocates for a lot of radical positions.
Fascism is a distinctly right-wing ideology but one could argue that it is not conservative, as it is too focused on revolutionary strenh, and the "conservative" movement in America resembles fascism far more than just, like, advocating caution.
