One from late last year (while DeSantis was in the news because of hurricanes) gave him almost a 20 point lead.
70 points in polls that didn't include Trump.
Start an investigation.
None of us give a shit.
Certainly not enough to come into a thread and vainly hope some people lack the moral consistency to not just be like “find out if he’s a creep and if he is kick him to the curb”.
Such a weirdly gross Hail Mary of a comment hoping people will be as willing to toss away morals as republicans.
Who cares, if he did something to kids toss him in jail and find someone better.
If there’s no proof that he did then move the fuck on.
B) explicitly prevented from exercising political power by the white conservatives with power because they’re heavily non-white.
It's because of the news cycle.
DeSantis hasn't done anything to "own the libs" lately.
As soon as he makes some full faced...
But half heated...
Gesture towards Trump's own base they will get a little hard on fire DeSantis in the next poll.
This go around no one is going to blow Trump off as a joke in the primary debates.
His first go around in 2016, no one took him seriously and just kinda left him alone so he could attack other people for them.
