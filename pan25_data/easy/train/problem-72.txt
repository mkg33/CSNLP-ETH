If the second-worst outcome happens and this Doomsday Glacier calves off and then promptly melts over the next year into the oceans, does that literally mean this thing has enough water stored in it, by volume, to literally raise global sea levels by a half-meter, or about 19 inches for the Yanks?
Not really.
Let's say you could capture the runoff (which would simply be impossible), and pipe it (or float, whatever) to Jordan (likely the first country to completely run out of fresh water) sure that gives a statistically small amount of clean, fresh water to a country desperately in need of it.
But now that cold water that was in the glaciers is gone and replaced by warm air and no pressure keeping the ice up.
Think of it like an early spring day as snow is melting, if you take the melting water out from under the ice on your driveway, the ice sits directly on the concrete, which is heated up by the sun a lot easier than the water, and the ice melts faster.
I don't know if I'm explaining this right, cause I'm now rather stoned.
Hope it helps.
