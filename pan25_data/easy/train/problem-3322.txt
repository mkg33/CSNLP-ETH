Absolutely.
Alito's opinion was faux religious outrage.
It was a xtian only approach to politics.
The satanic temple should instantly have been granted a religious exemption.
According to the article followers of Judaism should have been granted the same.
They were not.
Instead the state laws often included language to protect rapists and abusers (no exemption for rape or incest).
Exactly.
If they were serious about freedom of religion instead of "freedom to only do what my interpretation of my religion says" than I can just make up my own religion (like every other religion anyways) and just do whatever the fuck I want.
It would be anarchy.

Henry Hudson discovered Manhattan Island on September 11th (completely ignoring that the name Manhattan comes from the people who were already liv8ng there), FDR ordered the navy to shoot german u-boats on September 11th, construction of the Pentagon started on September 11th, and Jerusalem was destroyed by the whoever's on September 11th (ignoring that 'September' wouldn't be invented for another couple hundred years).
Oh I 100% agree.
But the people running things believe in a different history, a different interpretation.
