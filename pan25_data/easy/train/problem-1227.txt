Yes, Fat Billy saved the Orange Shitgibbon’s ass many times in his Presiduncy.
That said, Merrick Garland still has not demonstrated that he’s overly concerned about the fate of the Republic.
He’s advocated for weak sentences for insurrectionists.
He’s scored some convictions of low level assholes, but thus far refused to touch those in “high positions of power” that were the masterminds behind the insurrection.
These two things combined mean that the next insurrection will use the same assholes, but this time MUCH more capable and aware of how to fuck the system.
The next insurrection is on Merrick Garland’s head.
He hasn’t done NEAR enough to save the Republic.
Maybe because he’s just another Federalist Society stooge?
I agree.
It is extremely difficult, to have any faith in this, or pretty much any aspect of “Justice”.
Not after the last time.
Not after how many years is it now?
The "special counsel" is someone completely different -- much like Ken Starr, has the power to complete the investigation and bring charges outside of the normal processes of the Justice Department, so as to avoid the appearance of improper political interference into a criminal investigation.
