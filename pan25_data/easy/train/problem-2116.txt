and there's been no Overtaking, no nothing by Governor Ron, and don't forget he's totally 100% for Trump, even if he's too afraid of the Radical Left to admit it.
I came in, Florida had nothing.
and he was begging me, "Sir, please help us out, Mr. President, we're Dirt Poor," and I said I'll think about it, but then out of nowhere comes the Radical Left Democrats with their Phony Elections, and now, now we're getting screwed.
you all saw the Polls, we had almost close to 100%, especially when it came to Trump, I was leading in every Place, everything you could think of, until Sleepy Joe stole it all away from us.
you know our Country used to be Beautiful Under Trump, but now, now we're just, and I hate to say it but I have to say it, we look even worse than that dog Rosie O' Donnell.
ok, you're welcome, thank you.
I can't picture any Republican politician beating Donald in the Republican primary.
Doesn't anyone remember how wild the 2016 primary was?
All of his opponents called him out for the empty, cheap suit he is yet he annihilated the establishment (Bush, Graham, Huckabee, Kasich, Pataki) and a bunch of then-hot names (Jindal, Perry, Christie, Paul, Rubio, Cruz, Walker).
For real.
Going to bed on Nov 8th I just wanted Trump to be arrested.
The next morning I wanted him to stay out of jail long enough to split the GOP.
Wild times.
