That's the best case scenario, because Russia is failing at the easy part right now: seizing control of all of Ukraine.
The hard part would be occupying a nation of 40 million people while being under extreme sanctions, said people being virtually united against you, and having the resistance be armed by the West.
The situation is hopeless for Putin, but he has been surrounded by too many yes-men to see it.
Albania, Bulgaria, Belgium, Croatia, Canada, Denmark, France, Greece, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Germany, Hungary, Lithuania, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Türkiye, USA and UK.
Tried that in 1812.
America got pissed that they got turned down so they just started trying to set Canada on fire, and then got their asses kicked.
The British burning of Washinon D.C. was direct retaliation for this.
Moldovan is Romanian.
The only differences are that it borrowed more words from Russian and that it still uses some words & phrases that would be considered outdated in Romanian.
It’s nowhere even remotely near the differences you see between Italian or German dialects.
As a Romanian, I can understand 100% of what a Moldovan would say, unless a lot of Russian loan words are inserted into the conversation, especially when there are Romanian equivalents available.
For example, a Moldovan guy I knew used the Russian “dvor” instead of “curte” (meaning yard), even though the Romanian word is not new by any means and did not need a loan from another language.
