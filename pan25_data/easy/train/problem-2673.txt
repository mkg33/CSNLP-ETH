While everyone was saying that Russian pull-back was a victory for Ukraine, I said it cleared the field for Russian missile attacks.
The big problem is that the USA told Ukraine it could not use weapons against Russian soil, but that is where the missiles are being launched.
I'll say it again, Ukraine has to ignore the USA handcuffs and go take out those Russian missile launchers wherever they are located.
Kick putin!
Provocation.
If nothing happens, they can point and say “see, NATO is worth fuck all”, if something does happen they can scream about how unfair it is, they didn’t do nuffin, it’s a false flag!
etc.
They have managed to accidentally hit their own country.
And has had accident on launches.
They might be precise if they work, but malfunctions happen.
Why in the name of Vladimir Lenin's butthole would Russia deliberately attack a NATO country after months of showing the world how utterly shit the Russian military is, and the undeniable superiority of NATO weapons, training, and intelligence in the hands of Ukrainians?
