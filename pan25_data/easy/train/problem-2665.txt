Well, not to sound like I support Russia, because I don't.
But it was very different before the war.
Putin has used this situation to drastically change the russian political and economic world, trying to wrestle more and more of it under his control.
I feel genuinely bad for the Russian people, it will take them decades if not longer to recover from this on a global economic level.
And im sure that many of them, just like in the states and everywhere else, don't support the actions of the current leadership.
And their lives are now fucked all because of the country which they reside in.
And through no real actions of their own.
Independent media already recognized convicted murderers in photos/videos released by Prigozhin (and state-owned media) from the event.
Yes.
Because serial killers typically do not have confrontational personalities and their chosen craft depends on them preying upon the weak.
The truth is; the majority of people here could probably intimidate your average serial killer as they depend on fear and intimidation as their means of power.
You take that away and they are helpless.
