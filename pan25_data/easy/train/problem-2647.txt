Problem with your analysis: Republicans really did go after abortion, enacting changes that are genuinely unpopular.
This is true.
The corruption is real.
I am so angry and hope we can rid ourselves of this.
My district had one choice, Bridget Fleming after everyone else mysteriously dropped out before the primary.
She lost the general.
In the article, the Nation makes a few valid points, but IMO, they missed mentioning quite a few contributing factors; in addition to the already mentioned gerrymandering, there was plenty of voter suppression, along with voter caging, several instances of reduced number of polling locations in heavily Democratic registered area, some polling places apparently ran out of ballots, early voting was significantly reduced, mail in voting was just about dropped completely in certain areas, and many reports of voter intimidation as well (Florida “election” police, for one).
Throw in the fact that mainstream Democratic politicians seem to fear progressive candidates so much they cut funding and support to the point it looks like they would rather have a Republican elected instead of a progressive.
Yeah, Democrats could have done much better, but all things considered, it should have been much worse.
