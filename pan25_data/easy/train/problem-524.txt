Not to mention the dispersion of light.
A laser shined from outer space would not stay collimated after a trip through turbulent atmosphere, crossing into a material with a significantly different index of refraction, also turbulent and filled with particulate matter, and then reflect back up through the same conditions with any useful information.
Mie scattering, Rayleigh scattering, index gradients induced through temperature inversions....without some highly advanced nonlinear optical set up with multiple beams mixing, allowing for the laser to self correct, being modified by either some phased array or passing through some advanced metamaterial, I don't think this is feasible.
The only way it would be feasible would be if the Chinese stole the IP from the US, because I know we have the tech to do this--I cannot imagine the funding and time this project would take at the budget available to the Chinese military.
And so are you.
Other comments are saying the same as me.
Wanna take a shot at it, or just say bitchy shit that adds nothing?
I'm guessing you'll take the latter option.
