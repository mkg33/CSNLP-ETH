Hereâ€™s the ultimate field test, we are going to hold the World Cup in a boiling hot desert country where alcohol is illegal.
Respectfully, no.
The world does not need this lesson.
The Qatari's made a bid for the tournament and as part of that bid agreed to allow sales of alcohol.
2 days before the event, they reneged on the agreement and FIFA was stuck.
You can't lie, expect everyone to accept your lie, and then criticize them for calling B.S.
This is a western sporting event.
If you don't like that, start your own tournament.
The Qataris lied through their teeth.
I guess they shouldn't be trusted with things of international significance.
Might as well have given the Cup to N. Korea.
Brazilians?
As a Spanish-Mexican I have 5 siblings but my dad has 16 siblings and my mom has 7.
I got a lot of fellow Mexican friends with 5-12 siblings.
Crazy..
It's like the entire world needs to learn to leave religious nutters where they find them, whether it's a desert, the mountains, or the cotton plantations, you need to keep away and not let them integrate into modern society until they can learn to follow basic codes of behavior without justifying misbehavior as being a result of their beliefs, such as when lying.
