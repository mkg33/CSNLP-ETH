>The mine field's size ― 250,000 square kilometers ― is larger than not only the entire Korean Peninsula (around 221,000 square kilometers), but also Laos, Romania (each around 238,000 square kilometers) and Britain (around 244,000 square kilometers).
Yes, you're correct.
I did a simple kilometer to mile conversion not taking the fact it needed to be squared into account.
You are right.
One of my favorite books is about a government deer culler in NZ and he got a gig trying to eliminate a “killer pig” that was eating a farmer’s lambs as soon as they were born so he baited the area with potatoes that had detonators stuck in them.
At night he could hear the soft explosions off in the distance.
Pretty ingenious method imo.
All of those places have to be searched and cleared.
There are the conventional mines sure, but there are all the other things that are effectively mines.
The unexploded ordinance.
Edit: As /u/Torbid pointed out, it is around 96.5k square miles, not 155,000.
My math is incorrect.
That being said, the point still stands.
