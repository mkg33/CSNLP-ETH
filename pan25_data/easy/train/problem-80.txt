This is not entirely accurate.
The Obama era rule only applied to trains carrying crude oil (not Vinyl Chloride).
Due to ridiculously poor regulations, the contents of this train wouldn't have been considered "highly explosive".
The ECP brakes are still the right improvement to make.
Obviously the Trump administration would have stripped the regulations either way, but the Obama admin did back down to the pressure from the train lobby when it mattered and the Biden administration never fought to bring the regulation back.
See what I mean.
you are saying that Trump breaking things has nothing to do with Dems fixing what republicans break, but it most certainly does.
Correct the republicans are complaining the Dems didn't fix the thing they broke in the first place after the Dems fixed it the first time.
Not entirely accurate.
The Obama administration capitulated to industry pressure and that regulation was only applied to trains carrying crude oil.
Not other flammable materials (like the Ohio train was carrying).
