It would be strategically disastrous, but I recall the last Republican president was prepared to withhold aid to Ukraine in exchange for dirt on his opponent.
The risk of Republicans obstructing support to Ukraine without consideration for the consequences if only to spite Democrats is very real, they've already indicated this.
It's the right call.
There will need to be hundreds of negotiations before a peaceful settlement can be made.
Even if Ukraine keeps saying we won't give you any land and we expect you to withdraw, that keeps communications open.
If they keep going back and forth saying no and the UA keeps pushing Russia out eventually it might lead to a brokered peace where Russia agrees to leave the last sliver of Ukrainian soil inexchange for an agreement not to host a NATO base.
Essentially a small token that could save the lives of thousands on both sides.
