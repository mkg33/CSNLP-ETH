Originally left and right was a question of Democracy vs Monarchy in France.
It had nothing to do with capitalism.
Throughout history the left has been used to describe liberalism and since the Democratic party is a liberal party, the term is appropriate.
After the growth of movements such as Marxism and anarchism, the term "left" became more commonly used to describe people of those philosophies with the original "left" liberals and other left-leaning capitalists being rebranded as center-left (which I am perfectly fine with.)
But to be perfectly clear, center-left is still left and no mainstream definition of the term puts social liberals or the Democratic party on the right.
They might be center righteous, but the Democrats as a whole are globally on the left side of the political spectrum.
They believe in an expanded government that regulates corporations and serves the people, they support social welfare like healthcare and food stamps, fund education, protect the environment, and put a great deal of focus on making a more free and equal country.
Nah.
Biden can go fuck himself after how he threw unions under the bus.
Him and the 80 Senators that fucked all those railroad workers are dead to me.
