I’d say yeah redistributing gerrymandering and changes to election laws and also intimidation and closing polling locations were some of the reasons… and mega churches telling their parishioners to vote Republican … and all the mass propaganda making democrats look evil… and dark money, corrupt candidates (giant douche or turd sandwich) have all played a part… and oh yeah does anyone remember how the post office had dejoy appointed and he immediately eliminated mail sorting machines and forbid employees from overtime - throwing away ballots because he made the mail take way longer.. or what about the lawsuit Bernie sander’s had against the Democratic Party because the votes were so close and Bernie probably got more votes… the judges decision was that since the Democratic Party is a private organization they can choose to run whoever despite if they had less votes… we need publicly funded elections more poll locations mail in voting and short term limits.
Admit I haven’t read article yet.
But the Dems have also ridiculous examples of gerrymandering like Maryland.
Not as prevalent as GOP.
Wonder if SCOTUS would do anything even if there were a scientific solution to districts.
Seems unlikely-fairness and a disinterested judiciary is not expected anymore.
Thats by design.
The courts are controlled by Republicans and they won't draw fair maps.
Ohio passed laws against gerrymandering but the Republican majority ran out the clock.
The only way gerrymandering will go away is if it is federally regulated, and the only way that will happen is if democratic States start gerrymandering.
