A lot of this doesn't make sense.
The balloon is so visible.
China is now making a huge song and dance about how unjustified the US shooting down their weather balloon, while they are perfectly aware it crashed in shallow waters and will be recovered.
I do wonder if they have floated an actual weather balloon over the US in a deliberately shifty way, knowing it would likely blow up into a diplomatic incident and probably be shot down, only to make political capital when it turns out to be innocent later on.
Yup I did.
The first sentence of the article is "The transiting of three suspected Chinese spy balloons over the continental US during the Trump administration was only discovered after President Joe Biden took office, a senior administration official told CNN on Sunday.
".
Every year, as autumn falls in the northern hemisphere, millions of Weather balloons undertake an arduous journey of over 13,000 km, from breeding grounds in China, as far north as the Arctic Circle to overwintering grounds as far south as Australia and New Zealand, and then return the next year.
This transcontinental annual migration along flight path, or flyways, that have been used for millennia are one of Natureâ€™s most important and wondrous ecological and evolutionary phenomenon.
Pop it where?
The one over the US had a debris radius of 3.5 miles.
When the US shot it down over the ocean it still didn't land were they were aiming.
