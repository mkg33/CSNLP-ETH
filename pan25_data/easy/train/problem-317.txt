I'm extremely curious about the how Western nations are planning for what happens once Ukraine drives Russia completely out of Ukrainian territory.
Given the current behavior from Putin's thug army, I wouldn't be surprised if they continue to simply hit civilian targets from sites within Russia indefinitely (or at least until they run out of munitions) purely out of spite.
Since so much of Western support to Ukraine has been predicated on not attacking Russian territory, or at least only doing so in limited strikes over the border, what's the plan for when Russia just murders Ukrainians from afar while hiding behind their threats of nuclear retaliation?
There will come a time when Ukraine may need to take this war into Russia, and hopefully that is being acknowledged, and support carefully planned for when it happens.
Idk about negotiating.
Iâ€™ve created a routine for blackout hours and have time to play board games with myself, create a horror story, and play with my cats.
A bummer I guess.
