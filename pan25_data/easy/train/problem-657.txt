Changing a window out for a vinyl double-paned one isn't actually that hard.
First, figure out what kind of walls and siding you have, so you can decide what kind of window flange you need if any.
If it's masonry, you generally don't want a window with a nailing flange.
Watch some videos about installation for the kinds of walls and siding you have - you need to know if and how to cut back siding, make sure the rough opening is appropriate for the size of window you have, how to shim it, flash it, not damage the vapor barrier/sheathing, fasten the window, seal it with foam, trim it out and do whatever needs to be done with the sill and casing, and caulk it.
This makes no sense.
If you aren’t getting condensation on your walls right now, putting in new windows won’t make condensation start on your walls.
Condensation doesn’t occur on the coldest point in the room, it occurs on surfaces colder than the dew point of the air.
New windows will not make your walls colder.
