It's really not rocket science.
Doug Mastriano was up there beating his chest about ending abortion in the state, and Oz was not even from here.
Their views are dying, hence they're only popular in areas of the state with lower populations that tend to have a higher age.
The only thing they have going for them over the dems in the state is that they're slightly more small business friendly than the dems in PA - if they were smart they'd lean into that aspect, but they will only go for identity politics - which is wearing off on the conservative suburban voters and only really resonating with smaller populations in Pennsyltucky.
The middle class is struggling increasingly year over year and they're a one trick pony that's getting pretty long in the tooth and the dems ran better candidates.
It's really not a puzzling thing.
When your party's platform is based on racism, nationalism, stacking the supreme court, eliminating abortion entirely, tax cuts for the rich, removal of environmental regulations, eliminating Social Security/Medicare, and is generally abhorrent to the average American you get what you deserve.
