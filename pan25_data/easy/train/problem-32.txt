Putin deep in his core wants to be a weird fusion of Peter the Great and Joseph Stalin.
Too bad he is more like Ivan the Terrible in his later years mixed with Nicholas II.
Anti-LGBT legislation being passed all over America.
Attempts at systemic erasure of a valid group of people.
No, the casualties weren't understandable.
Not only was the early WWII Soviet Army woefully under-led (they purged anyone with a semblance of skill in favor of party loyalty), their doctrine was also very bad, and their equipment was tragically poor.
One doctrinal example, while they were technically on the retreat, they had the policy of constantly counter-attacking, regardless of situation.
Attackers (and counter-attackers) usually suffer more casualties than defenders, for obvious reasons.
Later, with some competence, they created a solid defense in depth strategy (like you can see at Kursk).
Early Barbarossa is how they earned the reputation of human wave tactics... which didn't really end even at stalingrad (north of the city), which they spent masses of lives to pin the Germans down to buy time.
Americans love speaking in hyperbole.
If you take what most what of they say at face value then you'd think that anything that they don't like is a grave threat to their freedoms.
