Please, can an Iranian answer this question: is life better under the Islamic Republic than it was under the Shah?
This marriage/rape/execution dynamic makes me wonder.
I’m not baiting or being stupid, I’d like an honest response, please.
I know there were horrific crimes committed by the Shah’s secret police, but I’m honestly curious if Iranians regret the overthrow and Islamic Revolution.
What would you change, if you could?
Would you keep the Pahlavi dynasty?
Do you prefer life under the Mullahs?
It seems things got to such a point under the Shah that a popular uprising overthrew his government, but no such general fury has truly erupted.
I’m in the west, so honestly, I don’t know.
The news was full of protests over the death of the young girl who was caught without her head covering, but now…nothing.
It was like the Iranian regime cracked down and the protests stopped, but we don’t know what we don’t know….
Christianity, Islam, whatever, they're all just variations on that perennially toxic "Abrahamic" monotheism.
