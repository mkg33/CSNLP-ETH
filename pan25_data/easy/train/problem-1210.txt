Republican Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert was indicted on federal charges of structuring bank withdrawals after prosecutors alleged Hastert had molested at least four boys as young as 14 and attempted to compensate his victims and subsequently conceal the transactions.
Hastert eventually admitted that he sexually abused the boys whom he had coached decades earlier, and was sentenced to fifteen months in prison.

Republicans are kakistocrats.
You elevate the worst because they aren't qualified, then if they do get power it all goes to the leader since their position is entirely because of leader nepotism and nothing to do with merit.
They are easy to control, feckless, willing to fall into any line required, and completely without scruples.
