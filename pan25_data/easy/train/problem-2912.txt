"The traditional Vaudeville comedy routine while juggling five swords was fantastic and it really is a feeling that we'd love to see replicated in the Chambers.
I'd love to see more of it!
I'll give you two big thumbs up".

Definitely legal.
The constitution states “The House of Representatives shall chuse their speaker and other officers”.
There is nothing that constitutionally prevents the house from choosing the 9 year old Prince George as speaker of the house, though he is not a US citizen, is not 25 years of age, and holds a foreign title of nobility.
Edit: this took my brain to some strange spaces, and it turns out that while young Prince George could be speaker of the US House of Representatives, he is not eligible to be the speaker of the House of Commons; as the speaker must be elected from the members, and he is ineligible to be a member of the House of Commons due to his age <18 and peerage.
