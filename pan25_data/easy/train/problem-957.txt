Time for working class voters to stand up against elitist corrupt judges who don't seem to have to answer to anyone You police yourself cuz you are doing a bang up job so far (in your mind) and we will then go on and police ourselves and see how long before this country implodes The people who are in control in this country need to get over themselves, get off the self promoting self enriching train and to the damn job you all took an oath to do!
Or has it been that long and you just don't care anymore Here is a hint - we the people are getting pushed to the point we don't care either and the state of this country shows it You all should be ashamed and do your job or step away so someone with honor can step in The right is in such a power feeding frenzy since mid terms they haven't stepped away from a self promoting mic long enough to realize we see all those empty promises they threw out about improving the country are just that - absolutely nothing - they are jumping right back over to spreading hatred and intolerance - not sure what oath that is in but whatever The history of this country that the right is in such a big hurry to bury is full of stories of citizens being pushed to the point they won't be pushed anymore - and they push back The working class knows this history and is tired of the oligarchy giving to itself over and over and over again - just sayin...
