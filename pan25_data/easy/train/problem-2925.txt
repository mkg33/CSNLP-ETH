I even can bet with you that after Ukraine win this war, and obviously ask NATO about joining alliance, and i think I don't need to explain why NATO needs Ukraine as participant of alliance, NATO leaders will softly refuse to Ukraine, saying bullshit like "yeah, doors are always open, Ukraine deserve it, but its looooong process, we are not suuuuure, we need to start negotiaaations, consultaaaaations and maybe in 30 years or more, we will find out, Ukraine will get a chance to not join NATO, but become a XXL VIP ultra best NATO partner, because you know put any stupid reason here" - or simply will start singing the same song that Ukraine been listening for many years from NATO.
