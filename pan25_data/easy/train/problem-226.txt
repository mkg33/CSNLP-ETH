At best, Russia will have 10 million casualties.
With 3 million dead and 7 million crippled.
Russia will be reduced to a country of 137 million people with 17 million men aged 18-50.
Of which, 7 million (or about 40%) are crippled.
The other 120 million will be under 18, female, or over 50 years old.
Thatâ€™s 1 able-bodied males in every 13 people.
Aka disaster.
Well they actually are maintained and run right.
So that automatically puts them leagues ahead of Russian armor.
As far as everything else most in service western tanks are much better than Russians in terms of electronics, optics, and survivability.
Guns tend to be a tiny bit weaker but not by much, and it doesn't much matter seeing how they are able to put rounds on target while moving MUCH MUCH better than Russian tanks.
Speed is pretty much same or better.
Weight is the big thing, most western tanks are fucking cows in that regard.
Of course they also require a lot more training to effectively operate all those advanced systems, and they cost a lot more to make and operate.
So like all things in life, there are a lot of tradeoffs.
