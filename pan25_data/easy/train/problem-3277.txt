Outright traitor.
Send him to the front lines on the Russian side.
They are so desperate they accept anybody.
He might even find a boyfriend among the murderers that Wagner hired.
People really need to understand the history of Russia over the past 100 years - it's a history absolutely brimming with imperialistic invasions/annexations, with a population either apathetic or in support of such policies.
Well yes.
Nukes make everything even more complicated on top of trying to find a proportionate level of intervention/punishment.
But noone is making the case that Russia ought to get off scot free should they lose.
It's about only administration-controlled parties , making it absolutely impossible for people who are not government-controlled puppets to register a political party or movement.
Bureaucratic barriers that are stipulated by laws can be totally ignored by pro-regime government actors, while even a single flaw in documents or procedure of party registration will lead to full halt and cancellation for any opposition.
That seems like a bad idea.
I don’t know if creating another pariah state on the level of Iran or Libya would be productive or moral.
Because that’s what excluding a theoretically defeated and humiliated Russia from the broader international community would probably create.
Not offering some kind of path to reconciliation would probably just even further exacerbates distrust and resentment on both sides, not a great outcome when it comes to a nuclear power.
And that’s not even mentioning the suffering that the general population would likely experience as a result of international isolation.
