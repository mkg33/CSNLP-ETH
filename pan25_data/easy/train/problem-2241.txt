Why didnt they have someone in the White House in charge of enforcing the law to that ex-President whom habitually broke the law and to this day still brags about that by saying "top secret stolen documents are mine give them back".
He publicly also put government documents in toilet instead of the proper file to brag about not following any rules.
And i will "stall all court indictments against me for years because YOU allow me".
And police lives dont matter when his maga army protests.
White House allowed such pathetic daily actions.
Need someone appointed in the White House to supervise and ENFORCE the rules of law on anyone working in the White House Our White House is not a place to purposely disrupt and disgrace.
Our police Officers will never be attacked by trumps maga army again.

Unfortunately right.
We have clearly articulated requirements for POTUS eligibility and we can’t add to it via passing a bill.
It would need to be constitutional.
Even though I’d 100% support it.
