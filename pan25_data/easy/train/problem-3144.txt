that depends whether you're coming at it from a virtue ethics or consequentialist point of view.
given that we're talking politics that have far reaching repercussions, i give the consequentialist view more weight.
and since we are talking about a country that just gave half of its legislative branch to the republican party because gas prices too high (and remember, this was seen as a better than expected outcome), i don't think any of these assumptions are much of a leap at all.
it's unfortunate, but ultimately this stuff is happening because it's what americans want.
after all, there's nothing stopping us from enacting basic workplace standards and protections, except for all the americans that would rather gnaw off their own arm than allow the creeping specter of socialism to... i don't know, cancel their dog?
something about 5g microchips and new world orders, probably?
