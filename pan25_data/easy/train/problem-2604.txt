The point I’ve been making, to say it louder for those in the back, is that religion is a disease.
It’s lies, slander, and bigotry wrapped up in the guise of humanitarianism, and if people truly kept it to themselves as the first amendment guarantees their right to do, I wouldn’t have a problem.
The religious freaks refuse to adhere to the barrier between church and state and continue their attempts to force all free Americans to comply with their imaginary beliefs.
And the religious tolerant seem to think they have a point worth listening to and refuse to reinforce the wall that was supposed to exist between religion and politics.
Ok?
There are billions of people that still believe in a higher power around the world and ,whether or not you agree, people in the US have the freedom to have religious views under the 1st Amendment.
If you think that religious individuals shouldn’t hold power you are infringing on the 1st Amendment at that point.
As long as the church and state remains separate I don’t see why it matters if someone is religious or not?
