We should be working on comprehensive prison reform.
This most certainly should include review of how to release many non-violent offenders/non habitual criminals, minor drug infractions etc.
This is factual.
But acknowledgment of this is not exclusive to prison abolitionists nor does it counter legitimate use of incarceration.
Grievances with the prison system suggests reforms that don’t require abolition, confinement has legitimate ground to stand on (specifically POWs, suicidal children, and mental patients).
Prison officials don’t require absolute or arbitrary power, prisoners can’t be bought or sold (as they used to in convict leasing), and constitutional rights sometimes including voting are still free to be exercised.
Nah.
Just turn them into places where criminals are simply locked up instead of places that serve the purpose of satiating the dark desires of sadistic and/or greedy people.
Someone losing all their freedom is punishment enough.
You don't have to subject him or her to the lowest level of hell.
