It slipped your memory to not drink while carrying a gun?
That’s not really something you should just forget, it should be drilled in your head pretty hard when learning to shoot.
You gonna just forget to not aim at anything you don’t intend to shoot?
Maybe you’ll forget red lights mean stop?
My other cousin is also non binary and AMAB (assigned male at birth), they identify exclusively through gender neutral terms because they align neither as masculine presenting nor feminine presenting.
They exclusively prefer gender neutral they/them pronouns and only use gender neutral titles such as partner/child/sibling,nibling.
They would feel dysphoric if referred to by pronouns that are traditionally associated with feminine or masculine presenting people as they do not identify with either sides of the spectrum.
Gender identity is a spectrum non binary people can choose which pronouns they prefer without it being indicative of their entire gender identity.
Often those who were born as one sex find euphoria using pronouns that traditionally indicate binary gender but those are just words that don’t indicate the totality of someone’s experience with gender.
Remember, gender is a social construct and a spectrum; identities such as trans masc or trans fem are terms typically used to describe non binary individuals who are towards one side of the gender spectrum in their expression but still identity as non-binary vs binary trans (trans men/trans women).
