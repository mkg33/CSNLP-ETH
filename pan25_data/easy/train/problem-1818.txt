The real takeaway from this war has been solidification of the Sino-American split into a new cold war, rather than Russia stomping Europe.
Putin, inadvertently, has created the pretext necessary to split the world into two opposing factors of which Russia has little leverage with.
Instead of strenhening Russia's international position, he has completely destroyed it.
Even in eastern/global south politics, Russia's failure to win Ukraine has put it far below China, below Israel, below South Africa, placing it between the DPRK and Brazil.
What do you mean?
It’s been rocky af since like 2005, why would it be any worse now?
A big part of this whole saga is Germany’s reliance on Russian commodities and the pipelines despite all the US protests, the non-existence of the Bundeswehr, and no preparation prior to the invasion, despite all the 5 Eyes intelligence.
Germany has refused to lead Europe despite enjoying the benefits of the economic unions.
Wouldn’t Germany have a big egg on their face and be more cooperative with everyone?
