It is not great, but there are a lot of caveats not mentioned in your comment.
For a lot of overseas deployments for over half a year, the company is required to provide resources and financing for moving your direct family with you, if you request it.
Being assigned to a position overseas is usually seen as being put on fast track to promotions etc when you return (international business experience, most likely language skills, etc).
Also the business is responsible for paying for regular trips for you and family to your country of origin.
Potentially.
It's a reasonable theory and if we did want more kids that would be the moral thing to try.
However lets remember birthrates didn't drop because life got shittier.
It's not like the past was some golden era where things were good and people had more kids because of that.
99% of the past fucking sucked worse than today.
Also general observations.
The cost of living in Tokyo and Osaka is cheap in comparison with comparable US or European cities.
This is a myth that perpetuates from the bubble times and never got updated with the last 25 years of development.
