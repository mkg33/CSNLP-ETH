In 1991 Sandra Regina, a poor Brazilian woman, tried to contact Pelé to reveal that she was his daughter.
Apparently Pelé and Sandra's mother had a relationship many years ago, she was born, but neither Sandra nor her mother wanted to approach Pelé and ask for financial help because they didn't want to be labeled as "gold diggers that were only after her famous father's fortune".
That's sad.
I grew up watching football because of him, Zoff, Rummennige and would sit with my dad during the war watching the world cup games on a tiny battery operated tv.
I can say my love for football was because of the flare of his play.
After he retired from football Pelé got involved in a few situations that pissed a lot of Brazilians, like his eternal denial that racism exists (he even criticized - instead of support - other black Brazilian football player in 2014 that suffered racism during a game), in that same year during the World Cup in Brazil, while a huge portion of the population was protesting against the event in our country (because Brazil should spend the money with more important things like education, healthcare, security, etc) Pelé said that the World Cup is more important than providing healthcare to the population...
