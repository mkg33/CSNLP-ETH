Actually there may be more institutional intertwining between religion and state in Saudi Arabia than in Iran.
Wahhabism, a subsect within sunni islam which is aggressively iconoclastic, largely is tied perpetually to the al-Saud dynasty.
The founder of wahhabism, Muhammad ibn abd al-wahhab formed a pact with the founder of the al-Saud dynasty where the two families would work together with the wahhab branch handling religious matters and the sauds handling the financial and political aspects.
This happened in the 1700s and has generally speaking remained the case up through the foundation of modern Saudi Arabia and to the modern day.
There was a period of slower separation between both the ideology and religious branch of the family, though this was ended in 1979 following the siege of Mecca.
Really interesting stuff.

Aside from pockets of homophobia, Black churches are generally liberal and tolerant and have a very long history of alliances with some of the greatest music ever (blues, rock and roll, gospel, even early rapping).
