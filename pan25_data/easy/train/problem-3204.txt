Honestly why shouldn’t India buy cheep oil and gas ?
India is a developing country that need those energy to keep developing I don’t see why they should stoop the same with China China also considered developing countries by the IMF.
unfortunately there are a lot of poor Indians areas that need to be developed so they need reliable cheap energy and why should India give up this opportunity if you look at it from India perspective and not western perspective also when did the west ever stand with India ?
America still supports Pakistan till this day Ukraine sell arms to militants group in Kashmir so UK did stolen Trillions of dollars when they colonize India Russia is a reliable partner to India that supplies cheap energy and grain to India and would hopefully keep be reliable partners in the future I don’t understand why it’s so hard for people from the west to understand that other nations had their priorities too.

Attract as much FDI from the Western World that are fleeing China.
This will shut up the western elites for 2-3 decades while he is oppresing muslims and other people who are slowing his project (and the project of people after him).
