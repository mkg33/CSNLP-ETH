That's too easy to say without knowing how, when, why and by whom this legislation was drawn up and agreed upon.
In any case, I don't think "shoot on sight" is ever warranted as it either assumes that the victim will always do exactly the same, or it assumes that human life is expendable (or both).
Both are unjustifiable if you ask me.
Another factor that contributes to this positive result is the development work and overall security enhancement in the fringe areas of Kaziranga, especially in the Karbi Anglong district in the southern periphery of the National Park.
Poachers would always travel through the rough and very lightly guarded hilly terrain of this district, pay the poor local villagers a handsome amount in return for a safe passage for themselves and the horn, and do the dirty deed without much of a hindrance.
But now that these rough and underdeveloped areas are being developed and policing and guarding there is becoming better, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the poachers to reach Kaziranga.
Kudos to all the forest guards and police personnel working tirelessly in those difficult regions.
