What does the committee hand over to the prosecutor?
Why would they need unrelated embarrassing information from 30 interviews that have no bearing on the case,or any other crime?
5 provide testimony relevant to the crime, 10 provide information on unrelated crimes, and 30 end up spilling personal embarrassing information that has nothing to do with anything.
Yep.
"Hey, Gym, be careful.
They didn't want you to know this but, Meadows already said he talked to you and they have the phone records.
".
Similarly, internal White House emails and communications, call logs and other records that the committee received from the National Archives after a lenhy legal battle with former President Trump were also expected to be sent back to the Archives unless directly cited in the report.
THIS!
The Rethugs don't want the raw data, they want the names of the people who gave it.
They want to "own the libs" by attacking and intimidating already terrorized witnesses.
If they publish these names guess who will be next on some whacko's kill list?
