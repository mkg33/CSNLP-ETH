I think this shows that Putin doesn't have an exit strategy or a plan in general.
This will drain Russia if he continues this, and unfortunately even with Western backing, it will drain Ukraine as well.
Second episode.
After the initial breach or wall Maria, there are too many people within the 2 inner walls left.
So they send like 200k people out to "fight titans and regain territory", aka send them to death for less mouths to feed.
It's where Armin's grandfather dies.
Absolutely.
I have stated and in certain subs argued this for months.
The first rate assets are substantially depleted.
A good example is ground attack missiles: varying from 50% to 90% depleted.
Many of which they no longer have manufacturing capacity, and those they can the burn ratio is several times that of production.
Latest gen attack helicopter KA-52?
They have now lost about 35% of their inventory and production is halted due to lack of foreign sourced components.
Worse is the loss of pilots.
Most of the skilled pilots with combat experience are dead.
Ok don't underestimate Russia.
But what in the ass is this man thinking?
We just sent 80-100 MBTs and.
Exactly.
This war is going to be substantially if not fully resolved by the end of 2023.
Not only is the asset transfer from the west ever increasing but Ukraine is starting to manufacture more and more of the assets it needs.
It can't make planes or tanks.
But it is making drones, artillery ammunition and now the newest item commencing production is its own 155mm self propelled guns.
The rate of production is very low, but it is happening.
