ACA at the federal level is a game changer and a way forward for fixing the health system(medicare for all too, but first we have to fix the fuck out of medicare which is just as bloated and broken as anything the insurance lobby has gotten their hands on).
Obamacare literally is saving my life and sparing me the additional hardship of having to attach health insurance to my job(which would have put me in significant debt because it's crappier than what I get on the open market, and more expensive because I live in a state that took subsidies to make it cheaper).
150K worth of healthcare and surgeries is costing me about 500 bucks for ER copays and some imaging copays - I see drs and specialists for a 1 dollar copay, I had no deductible to meet and an OOP max of around 1200, it costs 250 a month on the open market with tax credits that my state offers to offset the cost.
