Because Vladimir Putin is the single biggest threat to international stability and world peace that exists in the world today.
Because through Russiaâ€™s petrodollars, Putin has been seeding authoritarian and far right movements across Europe and much of the world.
Much of the global instability we are experiencing today (see the 2016 US Presidential election and Brexit) are events that Putin himself pushed to happen.
Through Vladimir Putin, Russia is the greatest threat to the post-WWII international order we have seen since the fall of the Soviet Union.
Now with Ukraine, Putin has made an unforced error and stumbled into what is potentially his own Waterloo or Stalingrad.
If Ukraine can survive and ultimately defeat Russia in this war, it most assuredly will topple Vladimir Putin from power.
For that reason, it is 100% in the interest of the United States to support Ukraine in its efforts to win their war.
2: humanitarian reasons.
Most people don't like seeing genocide, even if their own nations have been responsible for it in other places.
Ukrainian civilians are being maliciously targeted by the Russian military.
They're bombing hospitals, schools, and refugees as well as raping/executing civilians when they take ground.
When civilians get pulled in people tend to carr more about conflicts.
