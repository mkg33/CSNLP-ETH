Basically, I think there's a very large fraction of the population that has no real desire to bear/raise children.
It's uncomfortable, stressful, time-consuming, and hideously expensive.
On the other hand, there's also a small fraction of the population that is just naturally good at parenting, but whose talents are sadly under-utilized because parenting is treated as an essentially private matter, rather than as a skilled profession.
It seems like technology could (a) maintain a stable birthrate, while (b) reducing distracted/half-hearted/inept parenting by "filthy casuals.
".
I think a majority of people would be fine with having children if the way our society is structured didnâ€™t make it so hideously expensive, career-damaging, and isolating to do so.
But for how long?
We're rapidly depleting phosphorus for fertilizer.
We're rapidly depleting energy resources which will be needed to mine phosphate reserves, the vast majority of which are located in the west Sahara; not very practical.
We're rapidly depleting resources required to sustain modern technology.
Most people can care less about future generations than they do about animal welfare.
As a vegan, I for one welcome the coming Apocalypse.
