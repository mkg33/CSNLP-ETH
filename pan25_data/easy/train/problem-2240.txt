I don’t know why but something about the timing of this feels so weirdly suspicious to me.
Days after the republicans take the house vowing to start all kinds of phony investigations…it just feels really dodgy.
I feel ridiculous even thinking that but after the last minute Hilary E-mails scandal and the last minute Hunter Biden laptop thing, it feels like the republicans have been playing a lot of games.
I don’t know anything, but I genuinely wouldn’t be surprised at this point if those documents wouldn’t be planted, I have so little trust in the republicans to play fair anymore.
That said: If Biden did take some documents home (as seems to be the implication here) I think he should be investigated for it.
I think we should hold all our public servants to the same standard.
I’m not personally as bothered by the current allegations as I was by Trump’s, particularly because Trump was so uncooperative and still currently is known to have had documents which are unaccounted for and some which were copied…the latter bit being particularly suspicious to me.
Also the nature of the documents could be wildly different, we just don’t know.
All I know is the optics are bad because the average American probably doesn’t understand the difference between a couple documents being found in Biden’s personal residence and filing boxes of nuclear secrets being found in a few locations around Trump properties.
