Keep in mind that Germany had to actually change its laws to support Ukraine as before the war started there were laws in the German constitution forbidding exporting weapons into active warzones.
That Germany isn’t taking the issue seriously for one, the other problem with your comment is that you do not differentiate between Germany exporting tanks to Ukraine and then issuing re-export licenses.
Germany aren’t willing to send tanks to Ukraine unless the US does that does NOT mean they are intending to block re-exports from other countries as stated by the German Defense minister.
No other country apart from the U.S. has supported the Ukraine more than Germany that is why I called your post bull shit because it’s an unfair and uninformed take on Germanys support of Ukraine.
For better or worse the US is the most important psrtner in the NATO and as such Germany is orienting their actions on what the US does.
Exactly.
If Germany can't take its neighbourhood's issues serious enough, then its neighbours have no choice but to disregard its concerns and rules.
Poland had signalled its willingness to break its Leopard 2 resale agreement by transferring its tanks to Ukraine without German consent.
