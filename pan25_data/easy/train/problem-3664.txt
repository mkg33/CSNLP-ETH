Taiwan seems to be doing exceedingly well regardless, and something tells me that the CCP doesn’t really have the balls to change that status quo.
By the time they need to, they won’t be able to.
It's dangerous when so many people support a movement that has no logistical planning laid out for the public to see, people should know what they're getting themselves into, which is one of the reasons why Brexit shouldn't have happened the way it did, there should have been several years leading up to it so all of the false promises would have time to be shot down by people who do actual research, that's one of the reasons why Scotland's independence vote is so dangerous, because no one has a clue what it could actually entail yet many vehemently support it.
And let’s be honest here.
Anyone who says it should be 75% wouldn’t agree to recognize the result if a referendum ended up being won by the Yes side with 75.1%.
They’d say it was too close and should now be 80%.
It’ll just never be enough.
You mean a voluntary union as a result of colonialism - specifically Scotland’s failures to establish colonies.
Thereafter Scots, if anything, played a disproportionately large role in the British Empire.
Exculpatory narratives on the latter shouldn’t be used to distinguish Scotland and its ‘civic nationalism’ from the rest of the UK in a revised tale of self determination.
No issue with self determination in principle, although the idea that the UK is just a ‘union’ that you can leave, rather than a nation state, will always underplay the complexities of independence.
