It’s become a very effective political boogeyman used to manipulate the public with fear and moral outrage.
But it’s so transparent.
It’s always only the opposition party that is so terribly terribly concerned about the national debt, and only until they are in power again.
Americans really need to start paying attention.
We are being led around by the nose.
"Since 1960, Congress has acted 78 separate times to permanently raise, temporarily extend, or revise the definition of the debt limit – 49 times under Republican presidents and 29 times under Democratic presidents.

Then you have the progressives who back Sanders who intentionally sabotaged Clintons campaign by spreading negative messaging about her in rural communities.
Sanders had no chance whatsoever, still has no chance at all of winning a national election...yet hes going to run again in 2024 in two elections, one to retain his Senate seat and another to fuck over Democrats again in the Presidential election.
And dont forget that Sanders did the same thing in the 2020 Democratic primaries screwing over Warren.
