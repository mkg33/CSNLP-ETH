Actually, not a lot is going to happen, because: (1) the House Republicans don't come in with any articulated policy; (2) they have the thinnest of majorities to work with, and a highly cantankerous "Freedom Caucus" whose members don't really know how to govern; (3) the presumptive Speaker (McCarthy) is struggling for support, and has very little political capital to work with; and (4) just by last evening's announcements (by Jordan and Comer), we see that they aren't really interested in governance, but instead want to keep driving the Klown Bus toward ideological oblivion (there was no "red wave" that materialized because voters rejected this sh\t, and yet these clowns learned nothing from it).

If Kevin McCarthy’s own statements and recent history are any indication, we’re in for two years of seriously dysfunctional government—including investigations of the Biden administration, retaliation against House Democrats for the January 6 committee and for booting far-right Republicans off their committee assignments last year.
There’s also a fight brewing on the debt ceiling that has the potential to crush the U.S. economy.
