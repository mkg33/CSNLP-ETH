Which fields might those be?
As I understand it, it's almost always about start-up costs being prohibitive.
For example, to build a chip fab, it takes billions just to build one.
Same with mining rare earth metals.
Very few companies have that kind of cash laying around to invest in long term projects like that.
Hence the Biden subsidies to build fabs here in the U.S.
It's to help offset that start-up cost.
And when they build widget factories in China, Singapore, Vietnam or India, it's with western plans using eastern labor.
That's why many companies are avoiding China -- they don't want their business stolen and then undercut.
That's terrifying.
What's also scary is that a lot of young people are on it, & are constantly consuming content while also being surveilled on their behavior patterns.
It has been discussed before that the "algorithm" is influenced by mass marketing campaigns as well a frighteningly narrow view of what "should" be popular.
Social engineering at its finest & no one bats an eye.
