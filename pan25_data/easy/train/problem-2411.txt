I think Erdoğan loves this nonsense.
It's a distraction from the economic mess that he helped create via incompetence and medieval policies, it'll get the masses riled up and lets him portray "the west" as anti-Islam, it could make him more popular in the upcoming elections and it also serves as justification for vetoing Sweden's NATO membership.
It's perfect, really.
Indeed... while our esteemed Turkish redditors have good reason to mock all the keyboard warriors demanding that Turkey should be kicked out of NATO (it won't, Turkey's location is still very useful) they are at the same time incredibly ignorant of how valuable Sweden and Finland are as well, and how much all key NATO members want to include them in the collective defence system.
Burning books is sin.
The sinful will be punished by reading the book they burned.
Libraries are now considered holy sights, and librarians are anointed.
🌩🧖🏾‍♂️.
If Turkey continues on its current trajectory, Finland and Sweden will be integrated into collective defence through alternate, complementary arrangements, bypassing Turkey.
This will only weaken Turkey's position.
