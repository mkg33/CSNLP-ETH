Some of their cities has a population from 10-25mil.
With Shanghai (The highest) at 27milion people.
They have completely unvaccinated population, have absolutely minimal previous immunity, horrible hygienic conditions in many places like wet markets, and apparently they just reopened absolutely everything at once with no control and no thought, and positive people are apparently now being forced to work as if they weren't.
Yes.
They tried vaccine mandates, aka forced vaccines.
But people protested that so they trashed it.
So you have a barely vaccinated and immunologically naive population.
(Most people until like now hadn't gotten COVID yet while the vast majority of people in other countries have already had it at least once or twice) everyone's immune system is different.
One person might get vaccinated and never get any strain of covid.
Another person might have vaccinated and get every strain of covid.
The same applies for people who get natural infections and recover.
The potency of their immunity could vary dramatically from one individual to the next.
