“Russian missile strikes hit critical infrastructure in cities across Ukraine this week, as many parts of Ukraine, including the capital Kyiv, saw the first snowfall of the season on Thursday,” it says here, and “President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address Thursday that more than 10 million Ukrainians lacked electricity, and that most were in the Kyiv, Odesa, Vinnytsia and Sumy regions.”.
i think this is where we will see the real resolve of the E.U.
theyre gonna get a peek into the future by how the ukrainian people handle this winter.
i think they will be able to convince the citizens of their various countries that the sacrifice is worth it to be righteous for this winter but given the severity of the winter sanctions might be a lot harder to sell next winter.
the high road doesnt come with blankets.
if this winter is really bad i imagine the peopel of those countries wont care how low the one comes with them is.
Hopefully.
Unfortunately there are laws that the west actually follows.
And from what I’ve heard it’s not clear what portion of the frozen assets can be used as reparations.
Actually no.
A Bond villain would plant a nuke right in the middle of Kyiv but on a timer.
Then walk away very pleased with themselves that they didn't just kill everyone immediately but they used a timer for dramatic effect.
Then Zelensky would defeat the nuke with 1 second to go.
