While you're right about the rich selling out the poor while the Indian Removal Act was being enforced, it's still not the root cause of the removals occurring in the first place.
It definitely made the situation worse for the poor and survivable for the rich, but it's not something that would have happened organically without pressure from the US Government, and the historians I've spoken to who are able to discuss the nuance of events like this in significantly more detail than a blurb in a textbook (and without the censorship state boards put on textbook makers) would agree with that.
The fact that in both situations, the rich could have used their power and influence to make things better for others is a moral question humans have faced since the beginning of time, but it's not the reason either of those situations happened in the first place.
Completely agree.
CollegeBoard has its problems.
But Academic Integrity is not one of them.
It's interesting because, for example, the AP World History curriculum was actually developed by the Air Force Academy.
That is one of the last places in this country you would accuse of having a "liberal slant".
