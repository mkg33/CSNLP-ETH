Nationally, local property taxes account for nearly half of public school funding, creating inherent inequality between wealthy communities that are replete with high-value properties, and poor ones, where properties are worth less.
State and federal funding is supposed to help level the playing field, but it is often insufficient to make up the difference.
And even if the funding were equal, advocates argue, students in poor communities often require more resources for things like special-education teachers and English language learning.
It is why, for example, the federal government allocates extra dollars to schools that educate high concentrations of students in poverty.
I feel that so hard.
I was in band, when we would go to competitions and see the highschool from one country over dump what had to be thousands of dollars into new costumes and set pieces every year was mind boggling.
