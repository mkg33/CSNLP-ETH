By the state, sure.
A church may have a more specific doctrine regarding marriage.
And no one is required to get married in a church to actually be married so going to a place that defines marriage as between man and woman and demanding a same sex marriage is kind of like going to an Indian restaurant and demanding chicken Parmigiana.
But this shit?
I totally don't get it.
This is the equivalent of black folk demanding the KKK give them membership.
It makes no sense.
Just saying, although I can appreciate that asking a religious man to invoke religious words towards something that is against his religion is a somewhat more sensitive situation, the idea of "its his belief" is a dangerous path towards outright discrimination.
Ok then.
I'm from a Catholic country but even in theology at school we don't do much bible reading so I'm really out of touch with all the do's and don't's except for the 10 commandments.
I have a Bible here somewhere but I find it a bit hard and confusing to read, especially as the discussions are about different interpretations.
