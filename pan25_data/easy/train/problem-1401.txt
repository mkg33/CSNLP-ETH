I'm quietly hoping that the reason for the slow progress is fossil fuel companies lobbying to keep funding relatively low and not actual scientific or engineering issues holding it back, and that their influence is being cut back (at least in the EU) to allow that field to progress faster.
It's not.
Trust me, it's not.
The last time I got into a serious discussion of the engineering challenges of fusion reactors someone flat out didn't believe me because the fuel they run on is so insanely rare it literally cannot be found in nature (tritium).
Challenge two is the fusion temperature of 100,000,000 C, which is what we'd tend to call "pretty hot."
It kind of goes on from there...
- Note that energy ≠ electricity.
The debate around renewable mostly focuses on electricity, whereas most of the energy consumed (and by extent, most of the greenhouse-causing energy) does not relate to electricity at all (think about heating homes, transportation, industry, …).
Yeah.
These articles bother me because a lot of it is just the Green Party saying it’s working and that they’re delivering when the reality is that Germany is seriously stepping up it’s brown coal production and consumption.
It’s not like I want to shit on green energy (I love wind power because it works at night and love it when solar panels are used in sunny places to power things like AC), but pretending that much of Europe isn’t furiously burning coal and natural gas at night is being dishonest.
