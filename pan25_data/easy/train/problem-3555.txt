The teachers could also provide a list of recommended books for reading to give parents more insight into how the lesson plans are taught.
My understanding is this is part of the conversation.
I am part indigenous, some of the things I learned in school were jarring when I was younger.
Luckily, I had parents that could walk me through my unnecessary worries.
(I had nightmares I was going to be taken away from my parents in elementary school and put in a residential home.
Lol.
History is more jarring when you realize it was your sweet great grandparents.
I am glad I grew up in a time where the battles and deaths were taught, but we didn’t focus on the atrocities.
It allowed me to research events from our perspective when I was ready and I didn’t feel different than anyone else.
The younger generation is mad when you teach them History.
History should teach the bad side but also the progress.
We should focus on a brighter future.
Yes, there are reforms I would like to see but I don’t feel hatred.
History should be a lesson so it’s not repeated.
I would want to know the books and materials used if I had a child in school.
