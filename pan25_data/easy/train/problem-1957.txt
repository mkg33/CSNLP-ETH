You don’t know what the hell your talking about and clearly don’t live in GA otherwise you wouldn’t have made this idiotic and belligerent statement.
Here in GA they actually made it illegal to give someone food or water if they are waiting in line to vote.
This is because the republicans running elections here always make sure in districts that have significant numbers of minorities there is always a conspicuous lack of polling places and operational voting machines.
This is to discourage gramma from being able to tolerate waiting in line for hours on end to vote.
There are also always news reports of people lined around the buildings in most democratically leaning districts which in and of itself is a deterrent for many to participate elections.
I live in a mostly white district and my wait time to vote, and I always wait to the day of because I am a procrastinator, is zero-10 minutes.
