I've consistently heard that Russians tend to answer such questions not with their own opinion, but with the answer that they think will result in them being left alone to live their lives.
Negotiations?
Negotiate about what?
How much Russia will pay Ukraine for their barbarism, how they will pay to make amends for their war crimes and just how fast they will leave Ukraine, including Crimea to never return, and how quickly war crimes can be argued for Putin and his minions before the court in the Haag.
Anything else is a disgrace.
Negotiations are simple.
Get the fuck out of Ukraine and your sons, brothers and husbands stop coming back in caskets.
