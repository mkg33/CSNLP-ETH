While the 26th is laser focused.
When asked, what age, the answer is 18.
When ask what constitutes infringement the answer is, denying them the right to vote just because theyâ€™re 18.
There would be no way to write a law that would be able to frustrate voting because someone is 18.
It would either be overly broad, or vague, both of which fail.
While I am a newly minted lawyer, I assure you it is impossible to skirt around this particular amendment.
It would be the same as trying to get around the amendment that allows for a direct vote of senators.
How would you even do that?
It says that state legislatures can choose congressional districts and virtually all rules regarding who is allowed to vote, how they vote, etc, and courts cannot rule any decision state legislatures make as illegal, even regarding state Constitutions, because the legislature has ultimate authority.
Don't be stupid.
That's not how this one goes.
This is not Roe v Wade, or even the Voting Rights Act, where the SC claimed to have some leeway.
