They didn't "gain" it, it was voted.
And so far it's the only country I know of where men voted to let women vote, it was imposed everywhere else.
The Swiss love voting, and that system makes them more democratic than lots of western countries.
Short-sighted analysis.
Finland is a NATO candidate right now, and has been given security guarantees to ensure Russia will not attack during the membership process.
Perfectly workable solution.
Not really.
In 2008 NATO proclaimed unilaterally that Georgia and Ukraine should join NATO.
Georgia was promptly invaded by Russia.
And once Ukraine had the audacity to get rid of a pro-Russian government was promptly invaded by Russia, too.
I think even the former NATO secretary general said it was a mistake by NATO to make such a statement and not follow through, leaving Georgia and Ukraine (initially) to their fate.
NATO should have made it perfectly clear when Russia invaded Georgia that such behaviour is unacceptable.
Maybe this war couldn't have been prevented, but NATO should have acted sooner.
