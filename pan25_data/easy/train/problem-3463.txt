Want to find out if someone is a partisan hack?
Ask them about Afghanistan or Ukraine.
If they say the thing you said they would about Afghanistan, they’re a liberal partisan hack.
If they complain about giving Ukraine money, they’re a fake patriot conservative.
Both situation are atrocities and we should be doing our best to find a solution for both (as well as other atrocities across the globe).
That’s an America I’d be proud of.
Afghanistan not being able to fight back a well armed terrorist organization who sees collateral damage as a win, and whose entire command base is in a different neighboring country who protects, arms, and funds them, is not the same thing as wanting the terrorist organization, especially when they had the rug pulled out from under them when the country that was supposed to be supporting them made a deal with the literal genocidal terrorists about the future of the country, without even consulting them, and then pulling out the NATO contractors who actually maintained all their equipment, and were intergral to how they logistically supported their FOB's, and units throughout the country.
