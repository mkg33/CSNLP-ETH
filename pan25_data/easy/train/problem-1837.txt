Sure, which is why the logic is broken.
Extend it far enough and everyone is guilty of everything.
This is why we don't say a car manufacturer is guilty when someone commits vehicular homicide.
Edit: Also when someone violates and doesn't follow a regulation and that kills someone, the company isn't guilty of murder.
They're guilty of not following the regulation and gets the punishments associated with that.
Which is why people get so up in arms when CEOs aren't arrested for murder after a kid dies in a car accident or something.
However, we do NOT want laws to overreach like that.
No we don't and neither does law.
I guess that's why I'm even talking about this.
This is why murder isn't man slaughter.
It's why gun stores aren't responsible for the act of murder that one of their clients committed.
You can blame the parent for being a bad parent, but you can't arrest them for murder.
And there are laws for child negligence which is what they would be guilty of.
They're not responsible for the crime their kids committed, but the are responsible for the kid.
That's why murder is not child negligence.
And ooh yes, removing Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in favor of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1953 didn’t backfire at all, and didn’t create a totally anti-American attitude in the country that led to the revolution in 1979 and the creation of the Islamic republic of Iran with the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini.
