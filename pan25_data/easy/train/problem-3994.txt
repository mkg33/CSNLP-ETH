Turkey is, as it were, sandwiched between the Arabian, African and Eurasian plates.
As the Arabian and African plates move northward towards the Eurasian plate, Turkey is slowly being 'squeezed' towards Greece.
Turkey is located in a very sensitive area where several plates meet.
Within Turkish territory, the great Eurasian (on which Europe lies), African and Arabian plates converge.
The country itself lies largely on the smaller Anatolian Plate.
That makes the area one of the world's most active earthquake zones.
There is a high risk of aftershocks in the areas after an earthquake.
Normally, the plates move about two centimeters per year.
But that's an average.
It is actually a kind of elastic in which the energy is stored until the pressure becomes too great.
Then the plates can suddenly move meters.
