Also because the propaganda doesn't have to convince anyone to support Russian causes, it only has to convince them to oppose local causes.
So anyone who has a problem with anything is a potential target for propaganda that simply magnifies the existing problem, and suggests counter productive actions.
Russian propagandists have already spent decades infiltrating every kind of extremist or malcontent group you could imagine.
The only thing that's changed recently is that social media has made the approach more effective.
Putin is destabilizing Europe?
Europe is doing a great job of it themselves.
So much so that the EU leaders even said that all the EU sanctions were going to crush the EU economy, but they were sure russias economy was going to fail first.
How's that working out?
There’s fascinating analysis of the Russian involvement in Brexit, it was primarily fed by platforming pro-brexit politicians and pumping out thousands of fear mongering articles to weaponise exisiting British ‘patriotism’ and convince the public they’d be better off alone.
I dunno.
The Ukraine invasion was terribly miscalculated, but Brexit was definitely a long term win for him.
That mess isn't getting fixed up any time soon.
