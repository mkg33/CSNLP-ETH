A target pellet inside a hohlraum capsule with laser beams entering through openings on either end, seen in an illustration.
The beams compress and heat the target to the necessary conditions for nuclear fusion to occur.

The science of nuclear fusion relies on smashing two atoms together at incredibly high speeds and transforming the energy from that reaction into electricity that can power homes and offices without emitting carbon into the air or dumping radioactive waste into the environment.
The Department of Energy plans to announce Tuesday that scientists have been able for the first time to produce a fusion reaction that creates a net energy gain â€” a major milestone in the decades-long, multibillion-dollar quest to develop a technology that provides unlimited, cheap, clean power.
In the decades scientists have been experimenting with fusion reactions, they had not until now been able to create one that produces more energy than it consumes.
While the achievement is significant, there are still monumental engineering and scientific challenges ahead.
