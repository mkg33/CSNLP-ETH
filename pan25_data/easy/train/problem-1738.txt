These things are what I believe they are most worried about.
The masks do not work at nearly the same level as pre-Omicron, as it's the virus itself that is less damaging but far more transmissible, where XBB1.5 is even more transmissible than BA5 by a large amount.
Some studies have shown the immunity over time has gotten shorter instead of longer where one showed the possibility of antibody dependent enhancement.
I agree with you there.
I had this for a short time after I stopped wearing my mask and “went back to real life”, but I can imagine losing loved ones would compound that issue for many people.
I only know one person who died of Covid, a friend who was around 40 and had health issues, but we weren’t all that close and I hadn’t seen him in a few years prior.
I guess when the trauma response is mostly just from having to sit around at home for a year or so, it’s obviously not going to be as impactful as someone who went through loss after loss over the same period.
I really feel for you, and I commend you for trying to work on things in a healthy way.
I 100% agree there should be some type of support for people who are struggling to get back to normal life.
