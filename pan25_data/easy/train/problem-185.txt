Earlier up someone commented on this guy's investments.
He won a couple but he lost some too.
I bet you if the people living in the streets had that leeway, to make big mistakes but have the resources to try again, they may not be in the streets.
The guy has lost more money than every poor person ever made in San Fran combined but is still rich.
He gets to play the game with many lives, while everyone else has a single life to get through life with.
Then he complains about how they don't take risk.
I mean, I donâ€™t know where that person is, but I have been involved in the party and there are plenty (like a couple handfuls I know personally off the top of my head just in my state) of far-left socialists and communists who are registered Dem and engage with the party, seeing it as an effective vehicle to organize locally.
Super clean?
SF?
You must have been in some selective areas because they seem to work hard to keep that gorgeous city looking like a trash dump.
It's a shame some residents don't care to take better care of the city.
