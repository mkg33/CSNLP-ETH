I think being incarcerated should be irrelevant to voting.
Even life sentences and death sentences.
What, are there enough lifers somewhere it's going to change the outcome?
They're such a tiny sliver of the population it won't matter in any but the closest elections.
Prisoners get treated terribly in the US, and they're an easy target with little ability to fight back for their own limited rights.
Plus, the ability to disenfranchise people creates a perverse incentive to create and apply criminal law for the purpose of shaping the electorate.
For sure.
I'm not sure how that impacts each party's hold on power, but it does seem notable that the special election in that list, if it was the one for Deal's seat, had 6 Republicans facing off against one Democrat and one Independent (who received 5.6% and 2.2% respectively) for the first round and two Republicans in the run-off.
It seems likely that the special elections in May and June of 2010 were for 9th District US House election - Nathan Deal resigned from the House to focus on his campaign for governor and a run-off was necessary when no candidate claimed more than 50% of the vote in the 5/11 election.
