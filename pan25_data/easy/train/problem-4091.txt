Ukraine pre and post 2014 are two very different beasts.
After Crimean they made a significant effort to get their shit together.
It probably wouldn't have been nearly enough without foreign intervention true, but Russia still got heavily bloodied even before Western aid started to trickle in.
Russia definitely went in half-cocked and without nearly the force they could have mustered, but the fact is that this all was still a significant investment of their potential military power and they got their teeth kicked in.
If this is how they performed against a military with only a minimal amount of NATO standard equipment/training (at least initially) it seems like there's little doubt NATO would utterly demolish them without much trouble.
Nike walks in.
A wooden signpost clicks flat on the counter as her fingers tap tap tap along its surface.
She leans in and speaks with a slight grin to cover up her annoyance.
This leads to a number of Ukrainian soldiers that can operate more complex weaponry as their own autonomous unit, against mobilized Russian "soldiers" with minimal training that need to outsource all of their decisions up the corrupt chain of command and are constantly having to be brought in just to keep up with the casualty rate.
They could still win it.
If they want to lose likely over a million or more.
But that’s only if China starts supporting them like we do Ukraine.
But I don’t think China wants their fingerprints on this one.
All this war has proved for Russia is that a relatively rag tag conglomeration of mostly former Soviet equipment and training in the Ukrainian military, plus a trickle of Western aid since 2014 and then a huge infusion in 2022, is all it took to halt and ultimately reverse a significant thrust of Russia's military.
So plan B.
Get shit off North Korea and Iran that older than Putin himself, and we already know how well these weapon systems have worked for Russia so far.
