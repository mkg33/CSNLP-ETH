It hasn't been talked about much, but corruption cost Ukraine control of the city of Kherson.
The governor stonewalled the deployment of defensive plans, and the city fell with almost no resistance to Russia as a result.
Russia funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into bribing Ukrainian officials; too bad for them that most of the bribes were either ineffective,or siphoned off by Russian corruption.
They fully expected no resistance based on the level of bribing and corruption going on among Ukrainian government officials.
Hell, even one of the lead negotiators from Ukraine at the start of the war was bought and paid for by Russia, and was feeding them information while "negotiating" a ceasefire.
Ukraine has done an incredible job rooting out corruption in the last year, but they still have a long way to go.
Exactly.
Corruption is drag.
And ever since Marcus Aurelius wrote it- “the most efficient army ALWAYS wins”, it has been true.
Corruption = Russian.
If they manage to draw this parallel they will solve the issue.
Corruption should mean not only getting charged for that but also getting charged with aiding the enemy during war time.
