We ALMOST replaced Manchin this month with Mandela Barnes in Wisconsin.
He only lost by 2 points after getting minimal funding from the DNC/DSCC and relatively minimal attention or assistance from the party until the last week or two of the race.
Had the Democratic Party gone as all-in on Barnes as they did Val Demmings, Barnes would have won.
Democratic leadership wasted money and time swinging for the fences in red-as-Satan's-ass Florida because said candidate is an Obama Administration alumna, while relatively ignoring a far more easily winnable race because the guy running is a Progressive Berniecrat who overturned the apple cart by beating the Moderate party favorite during the Primary.
is she?
fake progressive sure.
otherwise her record matches the history of most dems siri if you're just looking at the last 6 years like the democrats didn't do the same sort of shit for 40 years now.
