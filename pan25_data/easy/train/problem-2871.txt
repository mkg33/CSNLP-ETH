Syria was supposed to be Putin's own Iraq and Afghanistan.
He gets to intervene, control militarily, have a little puppet government and make money out of it.
He could even meet Assad not in his palace but rather make Assad come to his base, just like they made Karsai and Ghani come to the US base for rapport.
On top of that, some perceived strategic value: Mediterranean port not subject to Montreux convention, being able to influence the region militarily, threaten US interests, threaten Turkish interests etc.
But I don't think one should underestimate that Putin seems to strive to do everything to get a twisted mimic of the US - the eternal strive to be on par, but in the most twisted and scripted way.
Disagree.
Kadyrov was one of the last to know.
In January there was as scandal where Kadyrovs men abducted a former judge's wife (they couldn't take him due to immunity) because their son, an emigre, had a highly regarded anti-Kadyrov blog.
SHTF hard with (Kadyrov is disliked in most of Russia).
