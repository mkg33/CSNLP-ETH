There's some situations where autodictats can be acceptable and college education is maybe unnecessarily demanded.
But that's not going to be the norm.
College is useful for many people, and you can't just replace college with internet videos.
Professors do more than just regurgitate tasty information into the mouths of little baby college students as if they were some sort of birds.
They also have the ability to curate information and sources, so that students can actually get what works, rather than having to fend for themselves in an internet that is filled with lots of useful information and even more bullshit.
And they can actually interact with students, get to know them and their strenhs and weaknesses, and address them as individuals.
Plus the university space is one where students can collaborate with each other, which can have a sorts of benefits that you can't get from YouTube university either.
