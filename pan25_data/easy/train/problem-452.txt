The democrats won many elections this time around because they helped people like Green win primaries.
Let her be the face of the GOP.
Sure that may motivate the GOP craziest base voters to turn out but it will turn off what were once reliable Republican voters and motivate democrats to come out and vote against any and all republicans.
All the Crazy GOP running in the last election not only affected their elections but many down ballet elections and even seemingly unrelated elections in other states.
How many state houses were flipped in part because of this effect?
I actually disagree.
If the dems can push the narrative that MTG represents the entire republican platform then the GOP will alienate the moderate red voting block and be stuck with just the loony minority willing to look past the obvious lack of actual policy.
Why?
Rr daughter was doing drugs while he was prez.
No one investigated her.
The kids of prezes can have their own jobs, and make money.
That's not suspicious.
Powerful peoples kids get sweet gigs.
Same as it ever was.
