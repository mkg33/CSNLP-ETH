Zelensky generals told him an explosion happened in Poland caused by a Rocket, he immediately jumped on social media blaming Russia without due diligence ignoring the possibility of It being his own Rockets, probably due to ignorance or blind trust for his chain of command.
Yes they would.
Putin wants a military response from NATO that he can manage and spin (say retaliatory strikes at launch sites), not one that will turn his armies in Ukraine to dust which is what would happen if he targets a NATO military base in Poland.
It was a Russian missile but they don't want to give Putin what he wants - a military response from NATO that will allow him to escalate to a nuclear standoff and then try to spin that into talks a ceasefire while making himself look like good guy saving the world from nuclear war.
If NATO admits it was a Russian missile and strikes back, Putin can escalate that into a nuclear standoff with very little cost, then push for a ceasefire while making himself look like the good guy saving the world from nuclear annihilation.
