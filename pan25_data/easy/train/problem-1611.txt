In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Also conservation.
No growing strawberries in the desert.
No building homes in the desert.
Water use in CA could be cut by 50% in homes, industry and ag so the problem is solved from two directions.
Conservation and desalinization.
Yes, yes it is.
Farmers and ranchers can change their tune now or after there's no water and no power.
I'll bet 2 almonds that those damns stop producing power before anything gets done.

California?
Last I heard they have a problem with NIMBYs blocking desalination development because most plants don't take care of the brine discharge.
It adds more cost.
(Other states, especially landlocked ones reliant on the Colorado river, should perhaps get a clue as well: prioritize crops that don't need as much water, and maybe arrange for a new compact that allows for a replenishment of the Colorado river itself, if they don't want a lonerm collapse, that is.
).
The water being taken from the river is being shipped to unsustainable homes, farms and businesses so time to move them or supply them with a sustainable water source which would be solar powered water desalinization.
No it doesn't.
It's a bad opinion article.
If people in Arizona want more water they will need to force farmers and ranchers to use less.
Same for California.
