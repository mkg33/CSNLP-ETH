Republican voters reeeeally need to get it in their heads that when they vote out of spite or hate because they want politicians who will hurt the people they want to be hurt, those politicians will do the same to them.
So when they can't get medication, or their daughter is dying because the operation she needs is considered an "abortion", or their social security is cut, or they're dying from a preventable disease because they believed the lies about vaccines, or they're freezing in the cold because of a bad power grid or so on, they can't be surprised because their leaders showed us how little they value life.

If they behave as Jesus preached in Matthew 5, 6 and 7, sure.
They chose the pieces of the bible they want and then cram it down our throats.
