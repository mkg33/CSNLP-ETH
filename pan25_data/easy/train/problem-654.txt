Russia is forcing Armenia to provide corridor to Azerbaijan, to join Union State, Security Council chief says.
Region:Armenia, Karabakh, Azerbaijan, RussiThe Armenian authorities have announced for the first time at the highest level that their strategic ally Russia is forcing Armenia to provide a corridor—through its sovereign territory—to Azerbaijan, as well as to join the Union State of Russia and Belarus, reported the RFE/RL Armenian Service.
Sometimes difficult decisions have to be made.
Armenia keeps getting beaten up by Azerbaijan and Russia wants to stop this.
If Armenia blocks access, Azerbaijan will attack Armenia, they will win and they will kill Armenians, destroy infrastructure and take the land.
No one will do anything about it.
The secretary of the Security Council of Armenia, Armen Grigoryan, stated directly on the air of Public TV Monday that the invasion of the sovereign territory of Armenia by Azerbaijan on September 13, as well as the closure of the Lachin corridor, is within the scope of the pressure being exerted by Russia on Armenia.
