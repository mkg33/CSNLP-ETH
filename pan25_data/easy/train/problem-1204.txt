I don’t think anyone has ever said ALL conservatives are fascists but to say you can’t see the fascist tendencies in the American Republican Party (especially in the past few years) is being academically dishonest at best.
“Small government” means a lot of things to a lot of people.
Many conservatives I know conflate “big government” with that time they had to wait 30min to get their photo taken at the DMV.
Unless it happened to them personally or one of their own, they have difficulty empathizing with folks even if their economic interest align.
For example, obviously I don’t want to lump all Latino people together but generally speaking as a group they tend to be very Catholic and pretty conservative.
You would think the GOP would be all over that but I’m assuming leaders made a calculation and figure it wasn’t worth risking the 1/4-1/3 of GOP who can’t let go of their racism and xenophobia.
Also, immigration?
The immigration system wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for policies in Latin America that has led to destabilized countries, which both Republicans and Democrats have played a hand in.
Republicans haven't even mentioned once a pathway to citizenship for immigrants.
I have a friend who's been waiting for citizenship status for a decade.
He's paid taxes and everything.
What is the Republican plan to help create a pathway to citizenship?
They only talk about immigrants like they're demons, without realizing a majority of immigrants have been here for almost a decade now.
