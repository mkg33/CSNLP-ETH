We use propylene glycol as an emergency energy source for weak animals here on the farm as it effectively can be burned directly in the Krebs cycle.
If an animal goes down with pregnancy toxemia (extreme hypoglycemia) then PG can often save her as it is absorbed very rapidly and bypasses the early steps of sugar metabolism.
It also requires no involvement of insulin or the pancreas, which is obviously in no state to contribute.
Exactly, most cells will not uptake glucose without being commanded to by insulin.
We do give glucose in combination as if the animal is capable of burning glucose it will benefit.
Livestock are very good at hiding signs of weakness, and an animal that has collapsed due to pregnancy toxemia is near death.
Hypoglycemia, hypothermia, ketosis, acidosis, there are so many things that have likely gone wrong.
Ease up dude.
First I’m not American.
Second it’s practically a generic term for conservatives.
Do you get pissed if when you see someone say Kleenex instead of facial tissue?
