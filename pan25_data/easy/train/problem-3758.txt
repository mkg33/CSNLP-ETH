Kind of impressive that I'm reading someone justify immigrants rioting in a country that took them in by blaming the country.
Moroccans aren't the only youths that live in those countries that are immigrants by the way.
I think it's just a lack of accountability and you pretending that riots haven't happened in Morocco in the past.
Learn to hold people accountable especially when other immigrants live in those countries and don't go out and torch people's cars.
Arbitrarily revoking citizenship is against international law.
I'd bet having a two tier system for ethnic/other dutch citizens is also grossly illegal, not to mention racist as it disproportionately and negatively affects ethnic minorities.
