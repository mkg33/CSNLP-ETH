There also probably aren't that many women working in NGOs in Afghanistan today.
Obviously some of them stayed after the Taliban took over but if you're a foreigner working in Afghanistan (especially a woman) you already know that you are risking your life.
Most NGO workers are passionate about what they do but not downright suicidal.
Yes, America has propaganda.
However, if you speak up and criticize it, no one is going to come to your house in the night, throw a fucking sack over your head, and drag you, your spouse,and your children off to a dungeon to be tortured to death.
And no one ever even knows what happened to you, by the way.
You just disappear.
Its authoritarianism by definition.
Control from the top down.
All life is dictated by the most "pure".
When things are going right, its because the state is perfect.
When its bad, its the people who dont blindly follow.
All must think the same things or the authority will condem them and life will be bad.
Look at North Korea.
Ignoring isn't an interpretation.
You claim they have some "insane interpretation", when it looks like a pretty straight reading of their religious text.
