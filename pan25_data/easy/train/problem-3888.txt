Granted, medical law is a complicated field, and it's not a great idea to speak in terms of absolute rights.
The government does have to create laws regarding medical practice and be able to enforce those laws.
There are certainly sticky areas of the law where someone who isn't a lawyer probably isn't qualified to talk about simplistic answers.
Generally, though, the government should not be in the job of prohibiting medical professionals from giving medical care (except in cases where a doctor is trying to force some kind of medical care on a patient who does not want it; again, generally speaking).
Exactly.
Just look at how Republican attacks on the trans community are rooted in gender stereotypes.
If you're a woman who wants to get involved with body building, you can easily become a target for not looking "feminine" enough.
A guy who grows out his hair gets targeted for not being "masculine" enough.
It all boils down to a philosophy of, "This is how I think that you should look/act/feel, so it shouldn't be legal for you to look/act/feel any other way.
".
