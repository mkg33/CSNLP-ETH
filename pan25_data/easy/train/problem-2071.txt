It’s important that people understand how important climate change is and that we still need to do a whole lot more to make things better.
That being said it’s also important that people realize that the changes we’ve made so far and the progress seem to point to things getting better.
If people think that we’ve accomplished nothing despite huge strives being made in almost every category to curbing climate change than they might think it’s better to give up.
Emphasize the importance but you have to show people that there is hope.
Also, individuals cannot affect this directly.
You don't get to choose what power company is available to you locally, and not everyone can afford hybrids or EVs.

You drive, or you don't work.

Capitalism isn't a natural system.
It's a made up economic model like mercantilism that preceded it.
And besides, I'm not saying capitalism is bad.
It does some things very well.
However, it's flaw, that it is poor at dealing with waste, corruption and other externalities are exacerbated by a global economy with no space for waste.
