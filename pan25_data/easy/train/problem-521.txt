Desantis is certainly smarter than Trump, but he lacks Trump's charisma... or any charisma at all for that matter.
Any competent speaker will destroy Desantis on a debate stage during the primaries.
I almost hope that Chris Christie decides to run again so we can see him snuff out another Florida politician's presidential aspirations like how he killed Marco Rubio's.

DeSantis has demonstrated recently with the jet flights dumping asylum seekers in New York, that he will break any law to attempt to score political points, especially if he can steal state funds and siphon them into his campaign at the same time.
However, he cannot steal as much as Trump can gather from Russians and small donations, and it is fairly likely that Trump's FSB backers will set a trap.
They will get DeSantis on record doing something illegal, and then turn him in.
DeSantis is as likely to be in jail before the 2024 nominating convention, as is Trump, and more likely to be convicted.
Same goes for Ted Cruz and Greg Abbot.
