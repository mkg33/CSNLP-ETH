Many citizens are raised to hate war and especially being proactive and aggressive.
If you buy gun toys, soldier figures or tank models for your kids, you count as a bad parent.
In school, they teach us Germany became wealthy because she stopped fighting her neighbours and started to trade with them, and trade was seen as the cure against war.
You dont want to fight your business partners, so in that theory it will make war impossible.
That has become the truth for the relationship between France and Germany, and you cannot deny it.
The whole situation is uncompromisingly complex.
Germany has to think about its own national interests while taking into consideration greater European interests.
It also has to tackle American pressure alongside the potential ramifications of what may happen with Russia (win or lose).
Then there is the domestic politics of getting involved.
Social democrats are inherently "anti-tankies".
They agree to follow-up and but don't want to be proactive and want to avoid being the aggressors at all costs.
