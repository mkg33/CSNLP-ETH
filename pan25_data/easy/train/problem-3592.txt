Now show me how five black cops who seem to get along quite nicely somehow are racist against black people.
Then show how white supremacy brainwashed them to hate and kill within their racial group.

Is it black supremacy that causes white people to kill each other?
Why or why not?

Well there you have it, folks.
Five black cops murder a black suspect and you have someone unironically blaming white supremacy.
