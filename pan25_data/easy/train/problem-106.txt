This guy is using the slippery slope analogy, saying that the more we allow Christo-fascists to get what they want, the closer we get to those horrors becoming a reality.
Afghanistan?
I hate what the Taliban is doing.
Especially as a woman, I really hate it.
But we gave them 20 years to get their shit together and they just didn’t care enough to do it.
The few that cared at all wanted us to fight their battles for them forever.
No pride in what they were doing.
No thirst.
Many Muslim-majority territories, including Brunei, Qatar, Iran, northern Nigeria, Yemen, and Indonesia's Aceh Province, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, Maldives, Malaysia, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates employ judicial whipping or caning for a range of offences.
The last 4 rely heavily on tourism.
Afghanistan was ambivalent about freedom, not particularly interested in self determination, and unbelieving that prosperity was even possible.
Sad but also true.
The US tried training Afghans to defend themselves for this and the footage was… hard to watch to say the least.
It’s like hoping for a good before/after results, but the after never came.
