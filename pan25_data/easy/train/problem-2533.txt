Would be better to read "government buildings of iran light up, and burn to the ground in support of protesting".
Because at least that would have an effect, instead of thoughts and prayers.
More fundementally, Ukraine is a nation-state with soliders, the Iranian protesters aren't even a solid group or organization but rather large unorganized public reactions to police burtality and sexism from the Islamic Regime.
That's your solution?
that is not going after the root of the issue.
That is not a solution.
maybe stop trying to make deals and negotiating?
maybe stop your citizens from going to Iran so they can't be used as prisoner swaps and bargaining tools?
maybe declare the IRGC as a terrorist organization?
how did you take down apartheid south Africa?
The solution is to facilitate the evacuation and relocation of innocent Iranians to safer nations.
We have the space and resources, we just need to give them protection, transportation, and loan them cheap property outside of major metropolitan areas.
