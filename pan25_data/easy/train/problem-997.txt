Eh, probably about as well as it could end.
The deep cultural rivalry and distrust between Northern and Southern colonies is well documented as far back as the 1770s.
Inaction by Congress (the main cause being a refusal to answer the slavery question) lead to the Civil War after over a century of hate and distrust.
The US remaining stable after the Civil War is remarkable.
The main problem with reconstruction wasn't lack of punishment.
It's not like you could punish a handful of Confederate leaders and the South would suddenly end their deep rooted racism and hatred for the North.
I'm usually hesitant to condemn collaborators.
A lot of them are terrible opportunists who sell out their neighbors, obviously.
A lot of them are also forced into desperate circumstances though, they sometimes help the occupiers because they're trying to protect their own family or have no other way to eat.
I don't know, it's a weird situation that I hope I never get stuck in.
Northern communities who benefited from cheap Southern raw materials and components were Southern sympathizers.
