This is a real problem with operational jobs where you need them to be staffed around the clock.
However, the problem only persists because scheduling is handled by a person and they don't want to be on the phone all day finding someone to swap schedules with you.
You can solve this with software easily.
I know because we did the same thing at my company (my team built the damn thing).
I wouldn't doubt if there is a stipulation in the union contract for the people that handle scheduling to not allow any automation to protect their jobs.
Damned if you do.
Damned if you don't.

Totally agree.
As a proud union member, it hurts to see this.
But remember, it was the Republicans who filibustered it.
If the Dems and Biden had their way, sick leave would have happened.
To those of you who say Biden screwed you and you won’t vote for him because of it, I say this; if a union busting Republican were in office, the contract wouldn’t even be this good AND he/she definitely would not allow a strike.
If you want grandpa Joe and the Dems to take action and make this a more inclusive democracy, VOTE in numbers too big to ignore.
