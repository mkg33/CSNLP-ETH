Extremism rises when the system in place is failing citizens and is corrupted.
Bad living conditions are in contrast with riches of few, people stop seeing it for its glamour and lean towards seeing it as a class injustice.
Tensions rise, desperation turns into blame, reason to violence.
Rise of extremism is natural reaction to something.
Impossible.
US courts are controlled by corrupt people 100%, ever person with an R next to their name is a traitor to their country, and they'll continue doing it as long as dumb people go to church for brainwashing.
I've yet to meet a pastor or priest outside of military that weren't corrupt morally and financially.
They're snake-oil salesmen, just found a way to not produce the oil and just the snake (deception).
That's because democracies aren't taking tyranny seriously.
There are extreme right wing movements in nearly every democracy now, and they're all working together like globalists (coordinated by Steve Bannon and his ilk and sponsored by Russia) to overthrow democracies.
Most of them continue to operate unimpeded despite having committed numerous crimes for which they haven't been held accountable.
It's time to hold them accountable.
The fascists who are trying to overthrow democracy belong in prison for life.
The turning point in this war against fascism will be when democracies decide to take the problem seriously and start going after fascists and arresting them for their crimes.
Democracy isn't intrinsic to capitalism.
What we need now is democratic socialism, and as soon as possible.
Public ownership, workplace democracy, electoral reforms, welfare and basic needs met unconditionally, wealth equity and a major rebalancing of power back towards the people.
We need democratic renewal away from the failure of this current economic system.
