This isn't "falling for spin", it's a response to you saying that transporting them across state lines is a crime because they're "illegal aliens".
They weren't.
They are asylum seekers waiting on a hearing to determine whether they will be granted asylum, and are protected by law from deportation.
They get documentation saying that they are in the asylum process and they're allowed to travel freely throughout the United States.
I think what DeSantis did was abhorrent and very possibly illegal but calling asylum seekers "illegal aliens" is just factually incorrect.
They're not undocumented either, because they literally have documentation from the United States saying "this person is currently in the process of seeking asylum and is allowed to be here".
PS.
We should probably both keep in mind that we are mostly in agreement, morally the act was terrible.
We're only discussing if this one point is truly a crime .
Asylum.
Seekers.
Are.
Not.
Undocumented.
They are considered an "authorized stay".
They are allowed to travel freely throughout the country.
It can't be true that it's "illegal to transport them across state lines" and that they're legally allowed to travel freely.
Heck, they can even apply for an authorization to work.
