If a former military member's staff packed up a bunch of classified documents, haphazardly mixed them with personal items, and stored them in various locations on his multiple properties, and it were unclear what documents were still out there, and there were legal hurdles involved in accessing the documents, and burden-of-proof hurdles involved in proving that the former military member personally directed some of the documents to be hidden from investigators, and there were suspicion--but no proof yet--that the former military man didn't merely hoard the documents but actually intended to give/sell them to adversaries, then this would probably result in a much longer and more complex investigation.
There was that Comey guy and I think someone else?
I'm not sure about the exact details, but it seems counter-intuitive to me.
Surely there's some other reason at play here?
