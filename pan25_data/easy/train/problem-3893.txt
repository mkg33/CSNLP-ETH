In the case of the 3 Texas cases, the lawyers there tool about a 30% cut.
The court proceedings took about 4 and a half years due to Jones not cooperating and trying to stall things whichlead to the default judgement.
I would suggest checking out the Knowledge Fight podcast as the two main plaintiffs lawyers, Mark Bankston and Bill Ogden make multiple appearances breaking down the cases.
So far in Texas on the Heslan/Lewis case has made it through the damages portion of the case and today they were in court discussing sanctions against Jones and his lawyers for their conduct during the trial.
Today's hearing went really, really bad for Jones and Co.
The Pozner case is scheduled to start at the end of March and the Fontaine case is scheduled for September which Jones has lost by default but still has to go through the damages portion.
Exactly.
Rich people can be assholes.
Poor people can be assholes to poor people.
But poor people cannot be assholes to rich / powerful people.
Thatâ€™s when consequences happen.
