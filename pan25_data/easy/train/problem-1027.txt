While post natal centers are indeed popular among women, I don't think no non-birthing parent leave is main reason, considering way more women prioritize "government aid on post natal center fee"(roughly 75%) over "giving partner parent leave"(roughly 38%) according to.
Yup.
I think this will just have to be something the world finds a way to adapt to.
We're not really like other animals who act purely on instinct.
Now that we have access to birth control, no reliance on having children of our own for survival, and many different opportunities and paths to pursue in life, the truth is just that a lot of people will decide that having children isn't something they want to dedicate so much of themselves to.
It's perfectly rational.
It's a huge investment in terms of time, money, freedom, and even health.
Why would we expect it to be something all or even most people decide to commit themselves to?
People say because reproduction is a natural instinct, but look at us.
We're clearly not all that bound to simple animal instinct.
That nurse/doctor/contractor/service worker/ etc.
taking care of you when you are 80 is the person who would have been born by someone your age.
If you have too many people in the country not having kids, there will be serious consequences down the road unfortunately.
