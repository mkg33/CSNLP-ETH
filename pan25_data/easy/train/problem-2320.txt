I sincerely hope so, what the asshole did, how fucking close we came to democracy dying in the USA, holly shit, it still touch and go and that scares me almost as much as that orange monkey taking the White House again, unless Republicans in congress grow balls and ban him from running again like the Jan 6 comity advised.
Why would that matter?
All that would change would be the name of the tyrant they try to prop up.
The support so many of them showed for Trump even after he tried to send a bloodthirsty mob into Congress shows how utterly broken and despicable the Republican Party has become, and their longstanding habit of enacting anti-democratic voting policies wherever they get control shows that this isn't some isolated incident, it's the end goal.
That’s a great point.
All these years standing there with my palms facing upwards saying, “this is crazy, right?” And then to see tens of millions cheering this madness on it’s all too easy to begin questioning reality.
But yes, just total shitheads; exactly as it seemed.
