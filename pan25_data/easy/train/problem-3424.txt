Canada has stronger worker protection laws than many countries.
The cop broke her contract and her employer is punishing her relative to her breach.
She might bring this to court, but firing her could lead the supreme court.
Also, the journal this article was published in, Surgical Neurology International, sent me on a really enjoyable Wikipedia rabbit hole.
The editor-in-chief, James Ausman, co-authored a self-published book with the author of the article you linked, Russell Blaylock, titled "The China Virus â€“ What is the Truth?"
Ausman also has some kind of lecture online about being a good doctor where he stops and makes a ten minute rant about how George Floyd was a criminal and the cops did nothing wrong.
He also publishes his own editorial articles in his "journal" like [this one] ( about how hyperinflation is going to destroy the global economy and collapse world governments in the coming years, the government wants to take away our guns to centralize control, and the existence of welfare means the US is a socialist country.
Nail on the head.
I thought my head was going to explode when I saw the same people who vehemently supported the protests and riots in the US then turned around and lambasted the convoy in Canada and the US.
People believe in the right to free speech.
Yes you can still be infectious, but your immune system already knowing what to target straight off the bat means that you are infectious for a shorter period of time and don't spread as much of the virus (since there's not lag time in which the virus is reproducing like crazy while your immune system finds its feet).
Ergo, less infectious than your unvaccinated counterpart.
Sorry!
I should have said "foreign nations".
But the narrative was primarily pushed by US shit disturbers.
The amount of airtime the convoy got in the US is probably more than all the airtime Canada got in the las decade XD.
