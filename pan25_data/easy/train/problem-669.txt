In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
We didn't.
A conspiracy of rich people did.
Look at the Federalists' Society, the Kochs, the Mercers, the John Birch Society, movement conservatism, et alia, et cetera.
Sup.
Court got this so wrong.
Corporations are NOT people.
If they were people, then the government couldn’t force them to have annual meetings or corporate governance rules.
If they were people, they couldn’t be used as legal liability shields.
They are a made up entity who’s rules can be established by the Congress who gave them existence.
One of those rules was limits on campaign finance.
There is also a legitimate fiscal reason for this rule since it is the shareholders’ money and shouldn’t be given away by employees.
Finally, money isn’t speech.
It is related to speech so limits should be scrutinized closely, but money is also inherently corrupting so the government has a legitimate interest to pass laws to keep corruption at bay.
