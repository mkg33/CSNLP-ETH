Russia threatens to send 100,000 more of it's citizens to their deaths if Ukraine won't immediately give up it's sovereignty.
Ukraine baffled by these conditions.
Honestly?
MAD is a farce.
If we want our species to survive a nuclear exchange, NO ONE must retaliate in a nuclear attack.
Nations cease to matter when nukes are in the air.
The only thing that matters then is the survival of our kind.
Reducing the lives and infrastructure lost, and the effect on the climate, is paramount.
Don’t underestimate putin.
putin’s leverage is HUGE this winter.
This winter the Russian Special Operation will become the Gas War, with putin buying loyalty and hundreds of thousands of troops from nearby countries who will avert freezing by helping putin destroy Ukraine.
N.Korea is supplying weapons and troops.
China is sending tons of military winter gear (in 50 ton loads) to Russia.
Watch for troop coordination, training and war games over the next few weeks.
The attack will happen during January and into February.
NATO and the EU need to make sure that allies don’t switch sides to get gas(looking at you Hungry).
Belarus will succumb to putin’s demands and fight.
From the Dead Sea, Russia will attack via Moldova.
NATO and EU must be proactive to avoid losing because their inaction means Ukraine is overrun a month from now.
Kick putin.
