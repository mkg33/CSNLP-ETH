From Argentina and lived back then in a very Jewish-German neighborhood I am attest there is a lot of cool history within all these untold stories or who knows what belongings or people we have yet to encounter History and this time was bizarre I love this history from that era.
Anyway.
Not looking to get into some long drawn out argument so I'll just say we agree to disagree.
Have a good one fam.
Exactly.
People have been selling goods to save their life since time immemorial.
The descendants should think about how they are alive today because their family member was so prescient as to leave Germany.
The whole family could very well have been wiped out, as many of our Jewish cousins were.
Isn’t that worth the 100 million valuation today?
The life of your children and grandchildren?
Exactly!
Like I mentioned, who knows who is who, maybe some fled and wanted to live in peace with a new identity and still live there till this day or have new families in the blood lines… USA does the same - Lots of high profile soldiers have new names and lives… ya think these people stay public?
Ugh I don’t think so..
