You're taking a lot for granted here.
Russia blowing up their armed forces for a pointless war in Ukraine will not make us "fall behind".
Russia has had victories in the past where nobody cried wolf about WW3 as you're doing now.
Ukraine can definitely be compared to other countries where a much larger aggressor has attempted to bite off more than they can chew without it spiraling into a global conflict.
I wish you luck when you ship out to go fight but it's the opposite of brave for you to volunteer other people's lives in a pointless conflict on the other side of the world.
Not only are you that kind of person, but apparently you volunteer people for a war you can't even justify.
All you got is "its WW3... trust me... don't be a pussy".
It's the kind of opinion that only comes from someone with zero responsibility for anyone but themselves and no grasp on global conflicts.
