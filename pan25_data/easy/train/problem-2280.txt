But you're right in at least one aspect.
It doesn't matter to the people who voted for him.
They'll happily believe any lie so long as that "R" gets in the office.
Disappointingly mild headline.
This guy appears to have made up literally everything about himself.
He didn't "misrepresent" parts of his resume... the entire thing is an exercise in creative writing.
r/politics is currently accepting new moderator applications.
If you want to help make this community a better place, consider !
He lied about working for Goldman Sachs and Citibank, lied about his employee's dying at the pulse nightclub shooting, lied about having a real estate fortune, is wanted in brazil for checkbook fraud, had eviction proceedings filed against him for not paying rent on campaign locations, had a company dissolved for failing to file records, doesn't live at (or even own!)
the address where he was registered to vote.
This isn't exaggeration.
It's bald-faced lying for decades of work and education, and attempting to curry sympathy from a massacre.
