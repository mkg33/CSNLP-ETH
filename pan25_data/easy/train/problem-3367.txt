Don’t make the mistake of thinking that europe and the west is doing the wrong thing by only using it’s “bark”.
If it were to bite, it would create a huge escalation not just in Russia, but across cities and towns (non-strategic too, Putin like to pick them and blow them up to make a “point”) which would create a wartime population.
On the event of decisions to send massive forces to Ukraine, Putin may decide to use heavier weapons , heavier shells, heavier missiles, and we know he likes to throw bodies at a problem.
Arguably Putin wouldn’t surrender/cancel his special operation even if pushed back to the borders by a larger and stronger force.
He is an evil fucker but he knows how to play an enemy and wait them out.
Or maybe the new Allies push forward to Moscow to topple Putin there?
Extra escalation and as an attack has now been made on Russian soil, all Allied countries can expect an attack on their soil too.
It’s not inevitable that Belarus gets directly involved, and if they do it opens a huge amount of border to defend against.
It’s not a border to go across and bring battles towards the Belarus capital, but instead makes the country need much more manpower to defend than currently, which is better spent defending elsewhere and better still - attacking, and taking back land.
....ok?
I don't really understand how this sentence has anything to do with the event or topic.
I don't think anyone even died here.
