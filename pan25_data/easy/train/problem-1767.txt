A state can't decide there's one tax rate for people born in the state and another for people who've moved to the state, and that the first set of people get a disproportionate share of the tax revenue on the basis of where they were born.
Huh?
Most of the land in PR is owned by Puerto Ricans.
Mainlanders own land in a handful of places that are nice and that is it.
There are even laws on the books in PR that limit land ownership - laws that are a major reason why the agriculture industry in PR is essentially dead b/c no farmer can buy enough land to set up an economically viable farm operation for crops PR used to grow a ton of like rice and sugar that require a hell of a lot of automation and scale to be competitive in the 21st century.
Heck, a lot of the big US companies that operate in Puerto Rico don't even own the buildings they operate in down there - they lease the buildings from PRIDCO who is probably the biggest landlord in Puerto Rico and an appendage of the Puerto Rican government.
