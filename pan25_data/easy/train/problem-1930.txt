Yeah it's...really fucking bad honestly.
I'm not someone that thinks that Russia can't win a battle(because they can and have many times so far) but currently it's excruciating seeing some of the drone footage.
Last one I saw a few days ago involved a group of like 8 guys just traveling what looked to be nearly 100 meters of growing fields with no crops in it.
They were pushing a group of of guys in a an extremely dug in trench/bunker position and they just didn't get fucking close.
The last few 2 guys crawled to maybe 20 meters from the trench before taking multiple frags.
The shittiest part is I saw 1 actual weapon between all the Russians.
Maybe they had stowed siderarms or something, but idk.
The reports show that they throw small waves like that all night and then the Russians will shell arty nearly on top of where the Russians pushed up to the furthest before dying.
autopsy???
you live in a fantasy land.
They aren't even picking up the bodies anymore, and the dead get torn apart where they fall by packs of dogs when the shooting dies down.
War is hell.
This war is hell.
Its a horror in reality, not some clean tidy police procedural TV drama.
