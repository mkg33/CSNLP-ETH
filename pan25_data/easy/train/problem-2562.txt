Same, took me like two weeks before I hit positive.
Rapid and PCR showed negative over and over while I was running a 103 fever.
My boss probably thought I was milking it but I finally was supposed to come back when it came back positive lol…got another four days after that.
It’s very individual.
Some super healthy people like pro athletes got it and had lasting COVID that affected them for months after.
Some people get brain fog.
I’ve gotten it twice now (once before vaccines existed, once after I was double vaxxed) and I had zero symptoms the first time and was sick the second time but not worse than previous sicknesses I’ve had.
My most recent booster had me feeling worse than when I actually had it.
Exactly.
This entire thread is just Americans who are assuming that EU/European regulations are as bad as theirs.
The EU has plenty of laws on these things and the foreign workers are seasonal workers to help with farming/agriculture because the domestic population aren't willing to fill in all the gaps in those sectors.
