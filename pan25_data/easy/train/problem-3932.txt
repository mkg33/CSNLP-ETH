Even if you could purchase a car and somehow get it to your house without a license, it’d still be effectively useless to you.
There’s a very good reason that you need a license to operate a car: bad drivers can pose a serious hazard to public safety.
As I see it, there’s no good argument for letting someone own something much more dangerous if they’re not willing to take the steps to learn how to safely and responsibly use it.
Gun ownership should be allowed, but it should be regulated to protect public safety.
Exactly.
The only purpose of registering guns is to enable confiscation of the large amounts of routine firearms the Democrats hold as a party goal to ban.
Registration is unacceptable.
Owning a gun makes you less safe, not more safe.
The person most likely to be shot by your gun is yourself.
I was robbed at gunpoint once and was very glad I wasn't armed.
I would have turned me losing $25 and a budget watch into a gunfight to the death with someone who had the drop on me.
That's just stupid.
