I've been watching street questionnaires from the 1420 YouTube channel.
It makes me really mad that the ordinary Russians lead their normal lives.
They don't have to hide in their basements, there's no blackouts, their lives haven't changed that much.
They say they either don't care about the special military operation, don't want to think about it, or they don't care about politics.
This will make them care about politics.
Good!
The sooner, the better.
But then if you go more in depth you realize that the RUB is stable because it's basically not traded (there are a lot of restrictions in place so the exchange rate means nothing as long as you don't have a free market), you realize that yes, prices for energy have skyrocketed last spring / summer and Russia made a ton of money, but it also had a ton on expenses related to the war and since summer the global prices have crashed back to pre-war levels.
Yes Russia has a rainy day fund it took more than a decade to build, but with current trajectories that fund will be empty before summer.
Yes, they had "only" a 2% recession, but the pre-war forecast was for a +4% year (so in reality the economy lost 6% last year).
Etc, etc.
