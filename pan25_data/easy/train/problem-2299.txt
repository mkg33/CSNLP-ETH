That isn't how the pricing is done with farming products.
If the meat price rise, I'll produce feed and profit.
If the grain prices rise, I'll grow grain and I'll profit.
If the vegetable prices rise, I'll start growing vegetables, and profit.
Same goes for anything that can be grown on my land including trees, wildlife, poisonous flowers, insects or what ever else you can come up with.
I'll grow what makes a profit, if it will grow in my climate (sugar cane and grapes are not viable yet, but with these massive contributions to global warming who knows what it will look like in 10-20 years).
Nice explanation unfortunately complete horseshit.
If you don’t know about a situation don’t act like you do.
The netherlands has a huge amount of ‘extra’ food that is exported since the government decided that we needed to be less reliant and therefore boosted food production.
So no there wont be any production pushed out of the country and ?transport costs?
also won’t increase and in fact emissions will heavily go down, as is the entire intention of closing the farms.
Don’t talk about things you have no clue of.
