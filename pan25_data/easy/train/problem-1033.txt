Among other things Ihor Kolomoyskyi owned several football clubs in Ukraine.
He would recruit people from the "football firms" which he also funded (football hooligan scene) as enforcers and hired guns for security and to do criminal corporate raiding and protect his businesses from other mafia doing criminal corporate raiding against him (common issue in post soviet sphere).
No they were not.
They were just told to chill out and are kept out of the public eye.
You don't "purge" a battalion as large as Azov, lets be honest here.
An interesting parallel of this phenomenon is how in the West post-war there were many groups that idealised Communism and the USSR, as despite the USSR also being an authoritarian state responsible for countless atrocities, they had fought the Nazis (considered the greater evil from a western perspective as western nations in Europe had only experienced invasion and occupation by Nazis) and so lay on the “good” side of history and still held positive PR with some groups in the West even through the Cold War.
