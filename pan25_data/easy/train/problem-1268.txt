I particularly enjoyed the photograph provided by her uncle that shows her grandfather on her fathers side in his uniform as a Nazi soldier.
She literally has a Nazi grandfather.
To be fair, the grandfather was very young and said he had no choice but to serve in the Wehrmacht or his “life would be over”.
And other family members said he was ashamed of it and didn’t like to talk about it and didn’t seem to be antisemitic and all that.
But, still.
He was a Nazi soldier.
You’d think someone with a literal Nazi grandfather would be a little more averse to hard right fascistic ideology, but apparently the money and fame was just too good for her to turn down.
She is 100% manufactured and the idiot conservatives just gobble it up because they’re dumb as fuck.
