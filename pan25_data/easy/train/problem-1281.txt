Oil prices are gonna do what oil prices are gonna do.
As long as we cowtow to SA they won't be a reliable source of energy dependence.
We can get off our knees and the oil prices will do what they do and if SA decides they'd rather go back to building trillion dollar cities while American taxpayers pay for their defense the they can treat the US with more respect.
Until then, fuck em.
Let them solve their own problems.
So Saudi Arabia, after fucking over the world with their oil shenanigans, told the US that iran is going too attack them (which is probably a lie why tf would iran do something so stupid when it’s barely functioning), and the US immediately jump to Saudi’s defense, sad.
Why?
Why are we defending Saudi Arabia when they funded 9/11 and increase oil prices to help Russia?
Not to mention they murdered Jamal Khashoggi.
Interesting.
I'm reading, that there has never been a formal treaty in current times.
You may be right - USA has no obligation to defend or sell arms to Saudi Arabia.
