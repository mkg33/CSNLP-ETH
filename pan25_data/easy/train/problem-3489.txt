For Crimea Russia used to issue passports with "issuer: Krasnodarsky Krai" (a neigbouring Russian region) instead of "issuer: Republic of Crimea", that's how EU can't distinguish passports from legitimate Russian ones.
Ok.
So Ukrainians live in this country called Ukraine.
They got attacked by this power crazed fuck called Putin who controls Russia.
Putin being a nut job that he is annexed parts of the country with a fake vote.
Because Russia is well known for killing fleeing people of any side.
As well as known for killing entire villages.
Many people would think it wise to stay where they are and hope that Ukraine can take it back.
If they need to leave the country for whatever reason they need a passport.
Only offices in Russian controlled parts issuing passports are issuing Russian ones because Russia pretending itâ€˜s Russia now.
So Ukrainians who need a passport will be told to go fuck themselves if they try and use the only passport they can currently get through no fault of their own.
They are not at fault for Putin being a madman.
Different governments have verification processes?

Mine took around 5 weeks this spring.
