You are showcasing why wars happen in the first place.
You aren't even understanding common sense - you are just being guided by your own rage.
u/WhiskeyMarlow may be Russian - but they cannot be held accountable for the entire country of Russia - especially it's government & military.
Can you answer for the countless number of innocent lives that America has killed in numerous countries?
Can you answer for all of the abuse in the Catholic Church under John Paul II's papacy (he was Polish)?
I think not.
I find your comments utterly lacking in self-awareness.
If you have an entire structure based on everyone being in position due to loyalty to the people above them, rather than merit… And if you have crap equipment poorly maintained because of a poor population and rampant corruption at all levels (meaning they want to steal and sell stuff, or just get away with not maintaining it)… And people conscripted out of desperation or force, rather than decent careers and a belief in what they are fighting for… It doesn’t lend itself to having a highly motivated and well equipped military who can be trusted to use their initiative.
