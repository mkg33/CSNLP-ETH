You see 9th Amendment arguments all the time in SCOTUS case briefs.
Consider the "fundamental right to self defense" alluded to in Caetano v Massachusetts: if it's important enough to be used to shoot down Massachusetts' argument that Ms. Caetano couldn't use a stun gun to defend herself from an abusive ex-boyfriend, it must be in the Constitution somewhere, right?
Where, if not the 9th Amendment?
Republicans pre-overturning did a great job of painting Roe v Wade as the court decision that made it legal for loose women to have consequence-free two-weeks-before-birth abortions, and that all of these abortions were the result of women intentionally going and getting themselves knocked up multiple times per month due to their own irresponsible habits and freedom from consequences.
Yes, it is.
It's also a nice distraction from the fact that they might have gotten by with extremist stances on abortion if he wasn't also a grave threat to democracy.
A lot of voters don't care at all about abortion but don't like seeing videos of armed men parading around capitol buildings.
If we don't have a stable government with rule of law then none of the other stuff matters in the end.
