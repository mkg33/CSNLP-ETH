I think that if McConnell is proven right— that the crazies can’t win the Senate— it would be a big knock on his brand.

But losing and claiming fraud still isn’t winning.
Gerrymandering maybe?
Suppression of voting, banning mail in voting, changing the rules, installing nutters who are conspiracy cults, intimidation of ballet boxes, invalidating your ballot because you forget to date it, umm there’s so much more but im tired of thinking about it.
Nope.
