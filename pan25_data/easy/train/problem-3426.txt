My point is that you can't simply assume that the fundamental values which you take for granted will be taken for granted by everyone, and if such values are expected to transcend cultural differences, then there needs to be very strong arguments as to why and how that can be the case.
The west can't even ask itself questions about what meta-cultural human values might be, or what basis we might have for even believing such values could have validity, bc the west has essentially abandoned the concept of genuinely real moral objects, even though we operate under the unspoken assumption that such moral objects do indeed exist.
I worked with a Russian dude for many years.
He talked to his mom and his wife on the phone multiple times a day.
I say "talked to," but the calls always ended with him arguing with them or berating them.
He exclusively spoke Russian with his mom, but his aggro tone was the exact same.
Somewhere between Somalia (basically governmentless) and Russia/North Korea is their paradise.
Exactly.
