As you might expect, the experience of the Easter Islanders only gets more tragic due to the slave trade and colonial exploitation, a process that transformed Easter Island from a lovingly cultivated garden to the treeless expanse we see today, with only a handful of locals to carry on their anscestor's traditions and stories.
To make it worse, there is a widely-held belief that the Islanders collapsed their civilization with their own incompetence, when in reality it was purely due to outside influence.
Huh?
The island was mostly deforested when the Europeans showed up.
There were recorded no trees taller than 10 feet.
Obviously the colonists fucked the Rapa Nui people over but Polynesians were INCREDIBLY destructive to the islands they inhabited.
New Zealand, Madagascar (austronesian but related) etc.
It's not clear from the article.
Is the lake recently dry or was it a lake bed tens/hundreds/thousands of thousands of years ago?
Obviously it wasn't a lake when they were built.
But did a lake form after and disappear or was what they originally were built on once a lake bed?
Also, if it was on a former lake bed then the formation of that lake must be relatively new as well, no?
Seems like a lot of geological processes happening in a relatively short period.
