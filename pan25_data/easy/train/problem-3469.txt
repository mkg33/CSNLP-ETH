So instead of fighting the war NATO hopes their economy will collapse or infighting will take them down.
Ukraine however cannot replace every combat age man (approx 60k training in Europe amd the US).
Ukraine is hoping 60k conscripts will counter the 100k man advantage Russia curfently has/had.
(Approx 1M russians to 800k Ukranians).
ukraine can maybe squeeze out 1M but Russia will conscript up to 1.5M... Its not an escalation Ukraine can win.
I agree, however Ukraine will run out of manpower long before Russia will...
Even trading 20:1...
So economic crash is best hope to emd the war.
Given to the disposable "separatists".
I know it's fun making jokes about them but it would be foolish to fall into the trap of thinking that's standard behavior.
It doesn't take much to make more AKs and the most expensive parts necessary for significant production already exists, namely the tooling.
Equipment?
They are ramping up production but that will take a long time.
Its being used/destroyed faster than they can manufacture it.
