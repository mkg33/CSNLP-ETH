Stinger is really great because it extremely limits Russiaâ€™s ability to use helicopters.
Which is important because helicopters are amazing for close air support and for evacuating wounded.
We were able to use them with almost impunity in Iraq and Afghanistan because we completely destroyed both of those countries air defense.
Right now stingers are not used a crazy amount because Russia is being more careful with their rotary aircraft because they know they are a threat.
Stingers can be a threat to low flying fighter bombers but they are only vulnerable for an incredibly short window because The singer operator has a limited range so they almost have to be set up beforehand to intercept fire bombers.
We knew.
We spent years explaining this to entitled people from the West who kept calling us russophobes (I have many an Internet quarrel about this behind me...) and westsplaining our history to us.
