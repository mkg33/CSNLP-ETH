Well, we apparently expected Russia to let the neighbor they share the largest west-facing border with join NATO.
We were making serious progress towards that end, and Russia (like it or not) is a major power.
I do not like them, I do not support their goals, but I acknowledge that they are a major power and will not be backed into a corner quietly, any more than we would.
I recognize we'd unleash hell on anyone inviting them onto our border, and I recognize they feel backed into a corner, with areas that have always been a safe zone around them since WW2 rapidly joining NATO after the cold war ended and we claimed to be at peace.
100%.
Pure MAGA politics.
But this is one place where I think there are enough sane Republicans left to push back, even though it means supporting a Biden policy.
Well, hope.
If you want to understand what is going on in Europe, imagine this: Mexico (a sovereign nation who supposedly has the choice to form their own alliances) is inviting Russia to form an alliance and establish a military presence in their country, and it sounds like Russia is considering taking them up on it.
Do we wait for Russian arms to arrive, or do we get a head start on dealing with it?
Surely we wouldn't just allow Russia to box us in because "Mexico has the right to choose"?
