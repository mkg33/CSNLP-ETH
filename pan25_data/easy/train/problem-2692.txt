It's a big stretch to call them promoters of war now, I understand those athletes have nothing to do with the war and their career is usually very short.
Everyone here seems to care so much about the fact that Russia then will claim some sort of superiority if they win something, but that's bullshit, none of you even know nor care about medals anyway, as most people do, almost only the athletes care and they're individuals with nothing to do with anything that's going on in their countries.
Let those people compete, ruining their dreams will do nothing for the war.
Focus on the real issue ffs.
Then you must also permanently ban Greece because Alexander the Great attacked Persia, you must ban Germany & Austria bc of Hitler, ban France for Napoleon's war on its neighbours, nan Israel for killing Palestinians, ban Palestinians for terrorising Isreal etc etc.
Why?
The Russian people don't exist while their country is waging war in Ukraine.
They can't be bothered to complain or protest so that means they fully support this war.
so fuck them.
It's hypocritical, period.
I get it that shitting on anything that's russian is a must in this sub, that doesn't mean you can be a hypocrite.
As simple as that.
