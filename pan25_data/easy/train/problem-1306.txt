I agree with your assessment, this is why I’ve always said I would be a conservative in a universe where “conservative” wasn’t code for “right wing bigot”.
I grew up poor so I’m pragmatic and, let’s say, thrifty.
Even tho I make good money now, I squirrel it away for those rainy days (like my dogs brain cancer that I thankfully had the funds to treat).
I’m self reliant, I like to backpack, hunt and fish, and I’m all about conservation and generally I just kinda want to be left alone.
Fuck the police state, fuck the nanny state (I mean like NY banning large sodas, not like, regulations on corporations), and like generally let’s all just try and focus on community and building it up better at the local level.
Unfortunately tho, other people who think like that also have some pretty awful views on human rights, women’s rights, other ethnicities, etc and so I’m firmly on the democrat side as just a decent human being lol.
It fits their brand.
My opinion of both is "nice but overpriced and you can probably find something you'd like more at half the price if you bothered to look around".
