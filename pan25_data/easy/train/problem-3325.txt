I didn't just mention our standing in the world.
The Infrastructure Bill, Inflation Reduction Act, Chips Bill, etc.
will have a positive effect on the economy.
It doesn't happen immediately.
I sure am glad people who need insilin won't have to pay more than $35 a month for their prescription.
Some used to pay hundreds of dollars a month.
My elderly father won't have to pay more than $2,000 a year for prescriptions.
As roads and bridges are being built across country it will bring higher paying jobs.
At least it isn't 'infrastructure week' anymore.
Things are actually getting passed.
We were hit with a global pandemic.
I hope things improve for everyone.
We had a chance to raise the minimum wage but Sinema and Manchin messed that up.
I hope it gets raised to $15 an hour.
My new senator, John Fetterman, will definitely push for raising the minimum wage.
He definitely understands it isn't fair people live paycheck to paycheck.
