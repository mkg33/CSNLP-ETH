The Courts have an automatic majority in the Judge Appointment Committee, so they can block (and have blocked) anyone who does not agree with their politics.
So that adds up to the justices + the Bar members having an automatic majority over the panel.
One of the proposed reforms is to the selection committee, which would give the politicians the majority.
I’m opposed to that as well because it just moves the power from one branch to the other and doesn’t solve the problem of activist judges.
No, blocking constitutional amendment is not what a Supreme Court should be doing.
The people should decide what makes up their constitution, not unelected judges.
The Court should be able to strike down regular laws that violate the Constitution the people decided on, they should not write it themselves?
Such “shortcuts” are needed because if they aren’t used the Supreme Court is going to start to strike down constitutional amendments.
They’ve laid the theoretical groundwork, and last year have even drawn up a specific test for how to determine when an Amendment should be deemed unconstitutional.
They’ve even gone as far to say that they will use it in the future.
Throwing in bar association as representatives of judicial government branch seems disingenuous.
The status quo sounds like reasonable system especially if SC appointees are long term positions.
What Israel is doing sounds exactly like getting rid of checks and balances which is par for the course of flawed democracies sliding into authocracy.
I live in one and this triggers all the red flags tbh.
