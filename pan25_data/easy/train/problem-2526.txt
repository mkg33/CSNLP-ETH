I've been noticing it's like every week or so, another minister, cabinet member, judge, or government official is sacked.
In nearly every case, non-government Ukrainian-based news sources can point to specific acts of corruption from these officials.
Absolutely.
Breaking the cycle requires a number of things, but it usually requires, at a minimum: (1) a leadership that isn't on the take itself; (2) genuine efforts at improving enforcement of the rules, including prosecution; and (3) improvements in the pay and conditions of ordinary workers so there is less incentive for them to be on the take.
All of this is much easier said than done.
It requires moral, political, legal, and financial capital which is very hard to generate if you don't have it.
It also requires time; its a sustained effort that usually takes at least a few years to start having a real effect.
If the problems are really serious then the vested interests that want corruption to continue will typically try to co-opt or even kill the people interested in carrying out reforms.
Italy is a case in point.
They have been trying to get on top of the mafia since at least the 1970s and yet in parts of the country it is still a major problem.
Judges who send mobsters to prison get assassinated.
Once the behaviours are entrenched it becomes a generational issue.
