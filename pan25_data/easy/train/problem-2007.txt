Yes, would've been nice if Japan did something similar, instead of basically deny the atrocities committed by their armies during WWII and refuse to teach what actually happened... Germany came out and did everything to "make up"(for lack of a better term) for what had occurred during the war and they've been allies since then, and I for one American am proud to have them as allies!

Superior equipment and weapon systems can easily make up for an unequal fight in terms of manpower.
We have seen this over and over again with the USA and Western powers fighting against weaker adversaries.
Just look up kill ratios in the Korean War, the Vietnam War, or Iraq and Afghanistan.
Of course Russia is (probably) better equipped than those adversaries, but Ukraine is being directly supplied by and trained by those same Western armies.
And, as I said above, as the war goes on Russia's equipment and weapons and soldiers will be of worse and worse quality, while Ukraine's will only be getting better and better and of better quality, again further reducing the importance of Russia's manpower advantage.
