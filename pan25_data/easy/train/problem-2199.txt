Unfortunately he's underestimated the depth of ignorance with the large swath of Trump supporters who call themselves Republicans.
In that group are folks like Mitt Romney, Liz Cheney, Adam Kitzinger, and John Kasich.
The rest have long since drank the punch and jumped off the cliff of sanity, peddling in self-made culture wars and imagined grievances.
So the seeming miscalculation on Ryan's part (thus far) is that reason would prevail in a timeframe that would allow him to return to lead the party.
Instead it's arguably gotten even worse, as the only thing worse than Trump and his brand of narcissism and grievance politics is an even less imaginative cadre of grifters who are basically fronting as a Trump cover band, playing his old "hits" even more poorly than the original.
I was part of this party until about 15 years ago, until I looked around and saw that for the most part the GOP had turned into a party of Chamber of Commerce types, but with an incredibly myopic focus on very short term legislation that padded their pockets with no accountability for any societal support (worker protections, environmental considerations, workplace/consumer safety).
And it's only gotten much, much, worse.
And this is not any endorsement of the Democrats, they've got their own issues to deal with.

Exactly.
Ryan bowed out in 2018 and set himself up to be "sane" Republican to pick up the pieces after the Trump fever breaks.
Skipping the 2024 convention only strenhens his play.
