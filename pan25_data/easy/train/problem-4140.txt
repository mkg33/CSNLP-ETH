What Western Hypocrisy.... it's OK to send missiles, tanks and other artilery...some even bought from Pakistan by UK...to Ukraine....because it is fighting against Russia...however Iran can't help the rag-tag Houties of Yemen who are being massacred by the UAE and Saudis Armies weapons bought from USA..
You mean the UN recognized US backed puppet regime.... why won't UN implement sanctions on Isreal over building and annexing Golan Heights land and the West Bank... why only selected implementation...let's call a spade a spade and don't give me the Biblical time ownership of Isreal...that just doesn't fly... what about Isreali massacre in Sabra and Shateela refugee camps...when it comes to Jewish terrorists don't exclude Ariel Sharon or other previous PM's...please...call them what they are...plain terrorists just like the Talibans...
Why?
Interference in Yemen is centered around keeping Western and Saudi Arabian influence over their country leading to the worst humanitarian disaster in modern history.
