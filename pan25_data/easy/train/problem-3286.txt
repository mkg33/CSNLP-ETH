EDIT\ there are far too many comments to respond to so I will post my one thought about it here.
They don't need to nominate an active house member.
They can nominate Liz Cheney, they can nominate Bill Gates, they could nominate anyone that they can get 6 republicans to agree on.
There may be a few dems that would never nominate a republican but I think there is someone out there that the democrats can partner with 6+ GOP members on to get put in.
It would show good faith from dems to vote with some GOP members and it would totally stop the waste of a legislative session by ending the upcoming wasteful "investigations" into the FBI, DOJ, Hunter Biden, Jan 6th committee and any other crazy stupid thing the modern GOP want to go after.
They don't.
The closest they have to a center right is Liz Cheney, as many others opted to retire instead of loosing their primary.
This party is fucked.

They are overestimating the intelligence of our voting population.
Half the people I know vote primarily on gas prices....
Which the government has almost no control over.
