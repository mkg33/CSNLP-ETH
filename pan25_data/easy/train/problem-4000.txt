The problem is that he cannot win the war as easily as he believed.
There's a group who have really taken the Kremlin propaganda and gone to town with it.
They're like the American QAnon types, ultra nationalistic and bloodthirsty.
They brand anyone who so much as hints at withdrawing without a total victory as a coward, and unpatriotic traitor to Russia.
Any failure to annihilate Ukraine would be seen as Putin being a weak coward, a traitor to Russia and in league with Nazis.
That's dangerous as it could damage his phony image and put his life in jeopardy.
Logistics.
There’s a limit to what Ukraine can handle.
NATO can give hundreds of MLRS systems but they’ll be useless if there are no rockets.
Many Western systems are also very different than the Soviet era systems that Ukraine is used to.
It takes time to learn those…especially combined arms.
That'a a no-brainer legally because Germany has never officially considered Crimea as anything but Ukrainian territory.
If there's a problem if would be purely political.
