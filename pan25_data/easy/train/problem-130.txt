This ^^^ that’s why these brain dead monkeys can’t differentiate from what is morally correct and morally corrupt.
All they see is blue or red.
Such an eyesore.
Lots of billionaires don't support shariah law style Christian social conservatism but are staunchly supportive of conservative "free market" economic policies (though they rarely discuss those views as much publicly).
This is often used as proof that lots of billionaires are left leaning when they definitely are not which must be strange to alot of folks in other western countries since their take on social policies or disdain for religion getting involved in policymaking that they virtue signal about would be considered a given over there and the focus would be much more on how they stand on issues such as tax policy or organized labor.
Nah mean?
A downvote on a comment I make does not change an NFT marketplace or the creators making their games through NFT’s, music being produced and uploaded as NFT’s to avoid middlemen, comics being NFT’s to attract a niche, and movies being planned as NFT’s to encourage accessibility.
Oh yeah.
Plenty of billionaires and corporations LOVE to virtue signal (just check out gay pride parades or corporate twitter pages during pride month or black history month).
They then turn around and support anti-LGBT candidates or causes all the time on a much more low key basis but then spend marketing dollars bragging about how much they support social justice issues (while spending 10x more on the marketing aspect vs. actually doing anything).
