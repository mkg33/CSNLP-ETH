This nazi shit is so easy to get support for.
Some people buy it because they're miserable and they're longing for some pride.
Some are lonely and imagining all the masses who're united behind the cause is a warming feeling for them.
Some, who have not bought this shit previosly, are starting to follow it now.
Because they're afraid, because rockets are exploding on russian own turf now, because russia could be beaten, and there's real possibility of civil war afterwards and decades of misery.
And maybe if russia would win they won't have to pay for others mistakes, and who cares about those pesking ukrainians when Motherland is in Danger.
Exactly.
There never was a treaty, period.
Just because some dude who holds no power over NATO said something, that doesn't mean that countries who are willing to join NATO shouldn't be joining.
NATO did not expand east, but eastern europeans countries ran west for protection against Russia.
Except it's totally appropriate.
How come America's invasions are consistent with attempts to "forge better ties", and Russia's aren't?
Like, the US didn't invade Russia, and Russia didn't invade the US.
It's the NATO chief that's whatabouting here, by bringing up something actually unrelated.
