I think it’s more that he relished the chance at playing Winston Churchill on an international stage to distract from all the scandals that were happening back home.
His domestic leadership in the UK was not the man you saw standing up for Ukraine.
Not that he shouldn’t have helped Ukraine.
The British public pretty much unanimously supported him because it was the right thing to do.
Not just helping Ukraine but standing up against Russia.
He’s not very popular in the UK after what he has done to the UK economy, the UK public and all the corruption that him and his government were engaging in.
Exactly.
It is also worth pointing out that the British military have been helping to train the Ukrainian army way before Johnson was PM.
British military trainers have been in Ukraine since 2014 I think, helping to build up the skills and weapon knowledge.
Seems reasonable.
I have no love for BJ, but I distinctly remember him being one of the the first world leaders to show clear, unambiguous support for Ukraine at a time when everyone else was pretty wishy washy.
