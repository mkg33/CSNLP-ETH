"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of President more than once.
But this Article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this Article was proposed by Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this Article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term.

Not to mention that between 2020 and 2024 something like 4 million+ trump supporting baby boomers will die of old age and be replaced by a similar amount of Gen Z voters, who even if they vote at the rate the youngest voters usually do will create at least a 6 million vote shift in support away from trump compared to the 7 million votes he already lost by in 2020.
Yes he's funny AF.
His interviews are funny, but after the laughs it leaves me very concerned for this country, I can't believe so many people fall for this.
I don't think they even fall for it, they just can't stand to admit that they supported a complete fraud (Donald Trump).
