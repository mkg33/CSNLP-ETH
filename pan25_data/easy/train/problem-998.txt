This is a safe R district.
The local newspaper did run stories about him and his lies and it didn't get picked up nationally (because what major news outlet wants to run with a story about a safe republican nominee, and have it turn out to be false, putting egg on their face for an absolute nobody?)
The democrat opponent had such minimal funding because it was a safe R district that they couldn't do much research.
It's not shocking that he slipped through the cracks and got elected.
What is shocking is that while his local republican party in Nassau County calls for his resignation, republicans on the national stage are largely silent on this.
Ok.
Here's what a lot of people don't understand about this guy.
Yes, he's a liar, an open fraud, has fabricated his past, committed crimes in other countries, made wild claims about his accomplishments, wildly embellished facts about himself, his background, personal life, his education and his family and has questionable campaign contributors and affiliations.
Santos won 54% to 45%.
Which followed projections from early in the general race.
Which is why Dems didn't devote much money to the race.
That kind of win, and the polling throughout the race puts it in solid "safe" territory for republicans these days.
I wish it would have stayed Dem, but it didn't, and wasn't projected to.
