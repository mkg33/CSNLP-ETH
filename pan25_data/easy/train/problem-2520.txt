It was a stupid joke and I should take things more seriously if anything.
Donâ€™t tell me I want to believe in denial.
TELL ME IM WRONG.
Do you think NATO will threaten Belarus with territorial occupation (explained as "liberation") in retaliation?
To me that would seem a good play here.
Not threatening Russia directly but certainly getting Russia's attention.
Iâ€™m getting sick to my stomach.
I am battling genuinely thinking this is serious and who to be with.

A redditor a lot smarter than me once commented something along the lines of, putin is foremost a political animal because he was former KGB a spy heâ€™s not a military strategist in the sense of like a general who wants to go around in battle it would be something he would have complete and total advantage over it thatâ€™s what he would want if you want political gain thatâ€™s why he does the false voting thing is no reason for that if heâ€™s just a general just send in his forces too kill everyone instead thatâ€™s why he wants to be so loved and seen as a strong man.itâ€™s like how is he gonna be able to keep this image while still facing reality.
