In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Hey.
Other people aren’t answering so here’s my two cents.
Once fascism, or in this case a reawakened form of Jim Crow, takes root, it’s very hard to uproot.
Under this regime all protest will be treated as violence.
But this repression must be met with vocal resistance at every turn to make it harder for it to expand.
Here’s my suggestions for how to help:
DeSantis is a case study in proto-fascism in his racism, misogyny, mania for anti-democratic machinery, etc.
Why is CRT so bad though?
You do know it has been known for years before CRT that Indians were screwed over by Pilgrims right?
And that Christopher Colombus was a murderous pillager?
So it's bad somehow that we are reinforcing the truth of America's past?
