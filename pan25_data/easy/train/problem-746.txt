The only times, ever, that this has not been the case is when the workers unionized, and demanded the change.
Unionizing allows the skilled workers to use their labor as a bargaining chip, while also creating a force that can influence politicians to passing labor laws that favor the working class.
This is what led to the 40 hour work week, overtime compensation, paid sick days, and health insurance benefits.
Despite productivity increasing tens of times over since then, not a single law has been passed that significantly improves the ones set in FDR's New Deal.
Seriously.
Itâ€™s like everyone on Reddit has a desk job that only requires 16 hours of work per week but are forced to sit at their desks for 40 anyway and they make more money than me.
Where the fuck are these jobs?
I honestly think the history of labor rights movements in American has been intentionally sanitized to 1) hide the fact that capitalism is exploitative by nature and needs to be rigorously regulated to protect people, and 2) obscure the methods used and battles won to secure those rights so they can't inspire new generations to keep it up.
