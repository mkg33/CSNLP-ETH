We traded an arms dealer to the Russians during a heated war in which he will most likely pick up his profession where he left off which will lead to dead Ukrainians.
All to bring some dumbass wmba player home who tried smuggling drugs into Russia which is known to be incredibly harsh.
The US is a laughing stock.
We're led by clowns.
That would mean he'd still be on the hook even with this order then if I'm understanding correctly, which I think is what the other poster was saying, the federal government is unlikely to leave something at just possession of Marijuana if they're taking the case on regardless of the actual circumstances of the situation.
How?
Russia needs its weapons, his contacts are at least 14 years old, and his photo is know and travel will be restricted?
He cant do anything special at this point, a burned out asset.
Exactly!
This guy has been in US custody for too long to be considered completely safe.
I guess I just can't imagine there isn't an arm's dealer in the war Russia hasn't contacted.
