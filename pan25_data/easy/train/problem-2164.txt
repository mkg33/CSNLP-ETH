In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Exactly.
Or someone quits or is fired and they “ask” if you can take in some of that person’s duties until someone else is hired, then no one else is hired, others have quit/fired, more tasks are “asked” of you, and by the time you realize it you’re doing two-peoples’-worth of jobs (that aren’t in your written job description) for the same wage as before.
Then when you ask for a raise, they say they can’t afford it.

It's completely unlivable.
Anyone who says otherwise should spend a year making minimum wage and then say something.
Also wages themselves just need to come up because this is some baby backed bullshit.
