I think it's very difficult for the left to theorize about things like that after we spent years shitting on the right for doing the same thing.
There was no end of coincidences or fever dreams they had which they would cite as proof that either the Deep State was moving against Trump or Trump was making some sort of brilliant 4D chess maneuver.
If we ridiculed them for that (which, I mean...rightly so) I think to be consistent we have to accept that things like this are coincidence and not more "Deep State" bullshittery or shadowy power plays.

Meanwhile, Trump had roughly 300 documents, including top secret classifications, human intelligence, and empty classification folders.
The DOJ received 15 boxes in January then raided his home to take an additional 33 boxes that Trump should have returned in January.
Trumpâ€™s team also found another stash of documents at a storage facility.
Trump has been fighting back and forth with the DOJ since and consistently posts personal attacks against the special counsel.
