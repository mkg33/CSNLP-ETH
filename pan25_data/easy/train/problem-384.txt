It shouldn’t have been but voters will turn out for a spectacle.
A lot of people voted for Donald Trump without knowing anything about his policies or caring about his fitness, they liked that he spoke in soundbites and said outrageous horrible things.
Barack Obama likewise benefited from being an exciting candidate, he was able to get out the vote in the minority communities although in his case people thought they might actually get representation for once.
Both candidates got votes based on who they are as opposed to other factors but one of them definitely did a far better job as president and it sure as hell wasn’t Trump.
Which policies specifically?
The ones where you <checks notes> believe in observed science and address climate change?
or the ones where you <checks notes> support your allies against an invasion by a literal fascist dictator?
Or is it the policy of actually having elections where people choose who will be in government that bothers you?
