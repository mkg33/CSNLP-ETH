This doesn't mean our goverment didn't lie.
To the contrary, ruling party (that today likes to claim the credit for Victory) lead the most extensive robbery of entire society.
Many "entrepreneurs" (tycoons, or oligarchs) sprung up over night, thanks to good connections.
Many people without military expirience where promoted for their connections, instead of capable former Yugoslav People's Army cadre, who passed military academys had expirience, and when shit hit the fan during the war, prevented defeats and disasters.
And zero profit.
Just loss in every way possible.
Lost economy, lost Russian lifes, brain drain, lost Western allies and oil sale, lost thousands of military equipment.
Might even loose Crimea now.
No gain whatsoever ðŸ¤·.
Yugoslav wars are often very poorly researched, especially outside former Yugoslavia, and foreigners often only look them through their own perspective; aka the Dutch will focus on their battalion in Srebrenica, Americans on their bombing of Serbia and Montonegro during Kosovo war.
