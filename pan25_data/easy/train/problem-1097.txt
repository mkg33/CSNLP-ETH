He really didn't.
He's a very gray character I agree, and his collaboration with the nazis is something I strongly dislike (it can be argued that he did what had to be done, but I don't buy that, we had atamans in our history who relied on the power of uirainians alone and achieved much more than he ever did), but not the raging nazi russia is trying to make him out to be.
Most historical data on him was written under strict control of the Soviet propaganda machine, which was not very fond of the idea of a free Ukraine.
Stalin absolutely despised any national movement happening under the Soviet rule.
Who is worse?
Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union?
As someone in the US they are both awful.
But who am I to judge if you lived through the Holodomor?
Right now people switch to Ukrainian not just because russia invaded, but because russia's "justification" includes "saving russian-speaking Ukrainians from bloodthirsty western Ukrainians" and "uniting with brother nation that speaks the same language" or even "Ukrainian isn't even a real identity and they are all just russians".
