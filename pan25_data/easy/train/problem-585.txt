It was in the context of it being easier for the FIFA organizers.
It’s easy to get things done when you’re working with one person who can demand anything.
If they’re cooperative, that means the organizers get whatever they want.
Pesky democracy slows things down, adds checks and balances, and ensures the safety and well-being of ordinary people.
Those all tend to get in the way of things like functionally-enslaved migrants workers who die regularly while building stadiums in the same heat deemed unsafe for the professional athletes who will later play there.
Or having a police force willing to commit human rights violations and arrest/kill dissidents or anyone your dictatorial friends deems undesirable.
Every World Cup is the same.
We all know how corrupt FIFA is, yet this Cup is like they don't even care to pretend they aren't anymore.
I really would love to see it turns into a Woodstock 99 elevated to a country size melt down.
How about this for a world end beginning?
Sound great to me.
In a tremendously unironic execution of policy consistent with FIFA's current attitude, the offending chants were homophobic sluts directed at Chile.
