With other non-Chinese brands, NVR user account credentials are typically managed by you/your users.
Meaning that if you lose your password, and if you never setup any password recovery method, you're out of luck and probably need to factory reset the system to be able to use the NVR again.
Think of it as your Windows PC.
Lose password?
Tough stuff.
Probably need to format the PC.
Australia is pretty much a western European country in the middle of an otherwise Asian-dominated area, It wants the economic benefits that come from trading with China (China is Australia's largest trading partner), but still wants the defensive assurances from the US and NATO and also wants to be seen as a Western country, despite not being in the West.
There is a weird perpetual "tug of war" between China and the US for political influence over Australia for both it's resources and its positioning geographically which creates a lot of controversial moments and pressure for Australia to choose between the US and China.
