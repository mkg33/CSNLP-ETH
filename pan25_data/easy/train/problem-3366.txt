And no one goes "I like my beaches with more bottles washing ashore", or goes "smell that mountain air, smoggy just how I like it", or points to a landfill and thinks isn't that just lovely we should have more of those around.

I am not trying to say indigenous people hate lula just trying to break this idea that specially foreigners have that lula was the saviour of mother nature disney princess,lulas deforestation wasnt lower than bolsonaro infact it was much bigger the backlash agaisnt bolsonaro is because the deforestation rised during his gov in comparison to temer gov,creating more ministries wont help we already have several programs for indigenous most importantly FUNAI but they dont work well and some indigenous hate it, instead of spending money to make a completely new ministry wich needs workers vehicles property etc why not just fix FUNAI,its one of my biggest critics of lula is that he think saying he put 5 billion into something will make the thing good and that results in dams that cost more than in any other country but work far worse.
