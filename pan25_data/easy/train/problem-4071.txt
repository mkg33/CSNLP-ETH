Hardly.
If all the non-military people all said no, Putin would have 2 options, punish them all or give into them.
If he punishes everyone society will collapse in Russia 100% guaranteed.
There wouldn't be enough people to run the country.
The only option would be to give into them.
Occupying any country tends to be a nightmare in general when resistance is involved, Ukrainian territories under Russian control will & essentially are to Russia what Afghanistan was to the Soviet Union.
140 years?
look at photos of Germany in 1945 vs 1985.
Bombed out ruins to the richest country in Europe.
Same goes for Japan.
.... obviously.
Of course it's fucking assumption, it's not like I work with the Russian military and am just sharing their secrets on reddit lol.
But it's not an assumption that nuclear weapons take a lot of maintenance, and it's not an assumption that Russia has been lacking the maintenance on their military equipment.
The assumption was that they are also lacking maintenance on nuclear warheads.
That's why I said "IF they have also been neglecting maintenance on their nuclear weapons..." So what's your point?
If you were half literate would already know which part are assumptions and which part are assertions.
