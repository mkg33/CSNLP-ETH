Privately funded groups taking action to give financial resources to a specific political thing is a political movement.
This is unreasonably stigmatizing normal political activist behavior.
It might as well just say "Biden actually has lots of passionate supporters" and the content of the article wouldn't have to change.

Again, that's regular political movement behavior.
Every notable political action in this country usually has some strong financial backing in Super PACs as the first step in it becoming a larger thing.
It's only "shadow" if you think someone positioning to run for president is "shadow" or donors backing media and other political work on certain issues is "shadow."
It is stigmatizing because this kind of behavior is never described as "shadow" in any other context.
This article using the term "shadow" is meant to stigmatize it as a subversive group that also does not have broad representation.
But the reality is it's just the opposite.
Super PACs getting tons of funds to support Biden and then using that money to work on engagement tools with the broader population is most things that have broad representation and popular appeal begin.
