Well the Germans did start with quite a successful army.
It was later when they started making Wunderwaffen.
In their case it was not that stupid actually.
Namely there was no way to outproduce the allies.
So they needed something special.
So they thought.
And the US was actually doing this too in terms of the Manhattan project.
Now for Russia.
It is all propaganda.
And they do not even put that much money in it.
It is all a smokescreen.
Like they still run around mostly in T72s.
They still fly mostly SU25.
Old but mass-produced stuff that does actually work.
Hence I do not think it is a mistake of theirs.
They know it ain’t all that.
They just want us to believe it is.
That is not to say they can build cool stuff.
They did and they do.
Their problem is operational in nature mostly.
It is difficult to evolve and adept if everything is just lies.
Interesting article.
It doesn’t mention the Russian cost which is understandable, but I’d be surprised if it’s that advanced to be in the same cost range.
