The only positive of a complete Republican takeover in '22 and '24 that I can think of is that there will come a time when the vast majority of Americans will have no choice but to denounce the Republican party for their failures.
The widening wealth gap, erosion of safety nets/worker rights and the effects of climate change will become to pervasive and severe to ignore.
Climate change in particular is going to completely upend the world we've come to know.
The world is on the precipice of confronting an existential crisis that can no longer be ignored and it'll become clear, very quickly that the Republican party aren't the right ones to be leading the US through the most perilous time period humanity will have faced yet.
Well said.
It's amazing how destructive the GOP is.
It boggles my mind how predictably cruel they all are.
If it could possibly be considered common sense legislation, that's a "no" from the GOP.
If it can put even a single red cent into the pockets of the 1%, that's a "yes.
".
