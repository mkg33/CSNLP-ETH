UofT medical is harder to get into than fucking Harvard.
The schools in the other provinces are all almost completely reserved for residents of those provinces.
The sum is that you have a cohort of qualified, academically excellent students in Ontario far greater in number than available seats who have to pursue medical school in the United States, Ireland, or just give up on the MD altogether, through no substantial reason of merit.

A physician also goes through a 2 year residency at a minimum, and considering this average includes specializations, that residency may be 5 years - and although that's paid, it's not paid enough to really begin paying off those loans.
8 years of post-secondary, then 2-5 years of residency, to be somewhere around .
Whereas a master's degree would end up with likely 1/4 of that debt in Canada, and enter the workforce at least 5 years sooner.
