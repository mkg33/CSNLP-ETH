It... just isn't.
Like I said, the UN, dictionaries, and the literal greek roots of the word genocide all disagree with you, genocide has a very particular definition, and ethnic cleansing is not the same thing as it.
What you're probably thinking of is ethnic cleansing, which is often confused with being the same as genocide when it isn't.
Despite actually sounding scarier IMO, ethnic cleansing would encompass lesser acts like relocation.
Even then, ethnic cleansing is done with the intention of replacing the relocated population with another, which I really don't think is Turkeys plan.
I just can't imagine they're going to start shipping in Turks to replace the local populace, that'd be insanely dumb and impractical.
Walkability is absolutely about distance.
The entire concept is like many European cities, or places like NYC where you co-mingle business and housing so that it actually makes sense to just walk a few blocks to get a coffee, or pickup groceries, being able to realistically walk where you need in many/most circumstances or things.
