Carter got it all right about US and world future.
US refused to face the truth and went with the fantasy of Reaganomics that set the US off on its path of debt and decline, war and global warming, inequality over equal opportunity, white supremacy over racial justice.
Now the US is battling the inevitable results, $30T in Middle East oil war debt, Trump, Global warming crisis and a GOP that has with no rational national policy and only offers white supremacy, voter suppression and oligarch worship and threatens US survival.
True.
Carter’s biggest problem was Ted Kennedy’s challenge to him.
When Bush almost lost New Hampshire to Pat Buchanan it was seen as probably a mortal blow, Carter lost something like a third of the primaries to Kennedy.
I love both Carter and Kennedy but damn Teddy should have waited it out a lot longer.

remembered actually began under Carter.
And in April 1980, he greenlit a daring attempt to fly into the heart of Iran and rescue American hostages by force.
