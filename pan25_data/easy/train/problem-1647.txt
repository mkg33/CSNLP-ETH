Agreed.
One of the areas my fellow liberals would consider me conservative is my support of the military.
One of the things both sides have in common the further you go in either direction is forgetting there is whole ass world out there and whether we like it or not we aren’t the only country in it.
We have to be vigilant and ready to go at a moments notice.
There have been huge missteps made by our government concerning the use of our military I get that but we need it and if we need to do things where hands get dirty well then that’s the cost of doing business sometimes.
We don’t do things all the other countries won’t/don’t do and it’s naive to believe other countries are following the rules simply because it’s the right thing to do.
Even with some of the shitty stuff we have done (barring the actions of some rogue soldiers who are terrible people) I still think we hold the moral high ground overall.
All that being said, with the trillions of dollars spent there is no fucking excuse for our service people to treated like decommissioned equipment upon dismissal.
We spent how much to produce a jet fighter and how much to use and maintain it but we can’t show the same respect for the man flying it?
That’s bullshit and that’s what needs to change first.
Seconding.
Couldn't do 10 proper pushups, run time was 2 minutes over the minimum (basic training scores were more lax/lenient).
