There are PLENTY of folks that’d AGREE with his views.
They might be a “fringe group”, but nationally there are probably millions of them.
We are from Texas.
We went to Sata Fe, N Mex.
to be married as soon as it was legal there.
A JOP performed our marriage ceremony.
There were two more lesbian couples that scheduled their marriage ceremonies that day.
We wanted to be first & went to the offices to sign up very early in the day.
The next day,(the day of the ceremony) the JOP said all three couples had asked to be first.
We told him we didn’t mind if he performed one ceremony for all of us together if the other two couples didn’t mind.
The JOP & personnel were relieved to go through the ceremonial process one time only that day.
So we all got to be first.
We we’re shocked how soon afterward Texas passed laws legalizing same sex marriage here In Texas.
But now, eight years later, with Abbott, Paxton, Cruz & the rest of the Texas GOP now in office (& most of them running for & winning re-election,) they’d overturn it in a heartbeat.
I keep,hearing how Texas is turning (slowly) purple, but I don’t see it- -even in my lifetime.
Civil Rights was a deal in the Kennedy/LBJ ’60’s.
That’s 60 years ago & STILL Texas is VERY BIASED & RACIST!
This includes our families & we didn’t announce, invite, or tell our families about getting legally married.
We have still not heard a congratulatory word from my family when they finally learned we were LEGALLY MARRIED.
And we are going on our 24th year.
