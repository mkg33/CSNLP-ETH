Oh I’ve got a job, but thanks, that doesn’t really matter.. A person’s value isn’t determined by their job, lack there of, or any type of their current financial situation.
There are much bigger issues than people stealing from Walmart.
Blaming these people instead of corporate greed has worked very well, clearly.
If stopping theft will make Walmart lower their prices I’ll gladly spread the good news!
Shilling for exploitative, multi-billion corporations definitely isn't heroic.
Your pov is basically: "Work harder so that the corporations can keep exploiting you".
Like i said, if they didn't exploit me i wouldn't steal but here we are.
Popularity among lower income consumers, possibly?
Hot dogs are for poor people and sausage is for people who may have more time to cook a fully-fleshed out meal.
Corporate culture has also discouraged confrontation with shoplifters.
I'd bet that a lot of the shoplifters aren't necessarily going to starve if they're forced to pay but they're fed up with the prices they feel are unjust and are effectively refusing to pay that price.
