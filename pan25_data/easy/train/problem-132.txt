I hate Trump as much as the next guy but weren't we supposed to go to war with them if we didn't agree to that deal.
The same deal where Iran decided where inspectors can go.
I really trust the Iranian mullahs who show so much compassion and integrity in their dealings with little girls who wear their hair wrong.
Syria's "red line", doing nothing when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014 or when they shot down MH217....please keep promoting Obama's foreign policy failures.
The mullahs really loved all that money to keep them in power.
Realistically you know nuclear technology is mostly a dying industry that can't come anywhere near generating power as cheap as solar and wind and as the grid level is trickling it means nuclear power will no longer be commercially viable because you'll basically just be throwing money away to run a nuclear reactor versus like solar panels in a battery Bank.
What?
This is a nonsensical tirade of crazy.
They have been steadily enriching further and further to apply pressure to the US and others to remake the deal which they NEED.
