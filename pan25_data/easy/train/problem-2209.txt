But since the Dem is the one in the lead, the only way that happens in this scenario is if the people voting against McCarthy are so dead set on him not getting the spot that they're willing to let the Democrat take it instead.
Say McCarthy was getting the 212 instead of the 203, the reps voting against him still want a Republican in the position, but they just didn't want their names attached to him specifically being elected.
You get them to pass the rules amendment, they can still vote against McCarthy, but McCarthy would still win.
Exactly.
And could you trust them anyway?
The amount of hypocrisy in the R leadership over the years makes it too difficult to take their word on anything.
No criteria.
You can literally nominate whoever, and a common rightwing theory has been that Trump will be nominated for the speaker, then impeach Biden and Harris, that way Speaker Trump, who is 3rd in line for the presidency, now becomes President again.
That will never happen, but it is a popular conspiracy theory.
