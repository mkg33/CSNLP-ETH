During the Cold War, the concept of the First World (NATO, Japan, and their allies) and the Second World (the Soviet Union, much of Eastern Europe, China, Cuba, much of Southeast Asia, North Korea, Ethiopia, and others at various different times) emerged.
The Third World comprised non-aligned countries (most of South Asia, Latin America, Africa as well as Sweden, Finland, Ireland, and other neutral countries).
The term Third World today has evolved to refer to poor countries, as much of the Third World was underdeveloped, though there were poor and rich countries in every World.

The real situation is Russia is a proverbial island with Belarus, and the same is true with China and North Korea.
It hardly compares to the huge blocs that existed during the Cold War and is certainly not a unified front or clearly divided blocs.
Acknowledging that China and Russia are clearly making moves to build their own blocs and suggesting that we try to avoid that is certainly not tantamount to "suggesting a new Cold War.

Every inch you give them is a mile gained in their power to diminish human rights and democracy.
