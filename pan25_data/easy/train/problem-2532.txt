Missouri passed it by referendum about 4-6 years ago, I think?
Then at the next election Repubs put a very confusing ballot measure to get rid of it.
They promoted it as “getting rid of money in politics” by lowering the amount state legislators could take in gifts from lobbyists.
What they didn’t say was that it only lowered the amount by $5.
( And by the way, it moves redistricting back to the state legislature.
But that was never mentioned in any ads about it).
Interesting!
I haven’t visited Atanta since the early 2000s.
A friend of mine went to this year’s Pride, and she said it was fantastic.
I should probably visit soon.
Amash, disgusted with the Authoritarianism infecting his party completely switched parties to libertarian.
Hmm.
The GOP in many states are tearing themselves apart over whether to accept/support Trump or Desantis or just stay quiet.
Unfortunately Trump won't let them.
He just can't shut up, ever.
- eliminate the nonpartisan state demographer and use a bipartisan commission appointed by the governor again for legislative redistricting.
Thanks for the snow tips!
Haha Personally, I love cold weather, so I think I’ll take to the snow really well when I learn how to get around safely.
Good advice We went to Boulder, Colorado last month and made sure to leave before the first snow.
Low and behold, I saw on the news that Denver has its first snow.
It resulted in a 100 car pileup Crazy.
We heard the news tell people every morning about how to prepare for the first snow (I’m not sure, but it sounded like there are even laws about what kind of tires/equipment you’re required to have the the mountain towns).
