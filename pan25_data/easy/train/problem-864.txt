This was for example the first time in 5 years that the Japanese government used the term 'illegal occupation' when referring to the four islands in official public communication.
Seriously.
Russia turned out to be so fucking weak that the Japanese military could easily reclaim it and give them a good fight.
Illegally occupying?
Japan lost the war, and thus lost the right to these islands.
Russia has been doing a lot to allow Japanese people onto there even if they aren't actually Japanese islands anymore.
There is illegal occupation like Crimea or Donetsk, but unlike Ukraine, Hokkaido was not occupied by the Russians.
It was lost in actual war, with Japan as the actual bad guys.
Hitler and his allies were not good people.
- On June 7, 2022, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova announced Russia's intent to cancel a 1998 agreement with Japan allowing Japanese fishermen to operate near the southern Kuril Islands, claiming that Japan is not meeting the financial obligations outlined in the agreement.
