Aimo Allan Koivunen was a Finnish soldier who, when separated from his squad and left with the whole squads full supply of Pervitin (WWII military grade meth) took the whole bottle because his mittens didn't allow him to pick out individual pills, and skiied cross country approx 250 miles (over 400km) while eating nothing more than pine cones and a single Siberian Jay (smol birb) that he caught and ate raw.
He evaded Soviey forces and was actuallynslightly blown up by a landmine before he made it back to a field hospital weighing only 95lbs (43kg) and with a heart rate of 200bpm, which medically speaking is way too fucking high.
Dude lived until 1989 at 71.
Alabama tweakers can eat their fucking hearts out.
Individuals?
No- or very few.
But they definitely have a cultural memory.
That’s why even though Finland wasn’t a NATO member the USSR never tried anything.
They may not acknowledge their failures in their history books but they absolutely remember as a nation the embarrassment they were served.
