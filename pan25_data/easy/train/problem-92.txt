what you're missing is 40 years of non-stop right wing anti-gov propaganda.
if you had been drumming that into your head you'd be one of them.
what do you think these farmers are listening to when they're tractoring or combining for 10 hours a day?
between the right wing radio and their own pandering asshat politicians they believe the government is actively trying to destroy them, while simultaneously giving them subsidies that allow them to keep farming.
it's pretty fucked up.
ðŸ’¯ Exactly.
So many of the solutions people are suggesting here would elevate a lot of problems in rural communities.
They have a lot of those problems tho because thatâ€™s what they keep voting for.
Blue states werenâ€™t given unfair advantages (ahem) to have better qualities of life, thatâ€™s what we vote for.
I feel for people who are actually disenfranchised to vote but thatâ€™s not the majority in most red states.
For the large part, they made their own beds and theyâ€™re resentful of everyone else because they have to sleep in them.
