“That’s not a Republican plan.
That was the Rick Scott plan,” McConnell told lonime Kentucky radio host Terry Meiners when asked about the provision calling for the sunsetting of Social Security and Medicare every five years.
“The Republican plan, as I pointed out last fall, if we were to [become] the majority, there were no plans to raise taxes on half the American people or to sunset Medicare or Social Security,” McConnell said.
“So it’s clearly the Rick Scott plan.
It is not the Republican plan.
And that’s the view of the speaker of the House as well.”.
Exactly.
Think of the SS contribution as time.
Bill Gates works 2 minutes to pay.
We pay 24/7 ( every second of every day) Why should the uber rich only pay SS for for seconds on Jan 1, while the rest of us pay out of every single paycheck?
Make it fair, everyone should pay 1.3 pct ( or whatever the percentage is).
