perhaps you know the story of Edison and his voting machine?
he invented a machine for tabulating votes quickly, and couldn't find a government that was interested.
instant voting didn't allow time for all the last minute back room conversations and pressuring that was part of their deal-making process.
Edison learned a lesson in market research.
