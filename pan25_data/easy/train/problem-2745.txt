Once Russia descends into inevitable civil war, NATO will move in and remove their nukes like they did to Ukraine.
The fact of the matter is the West is giving material support to Ukraine and Russia has threatened nuclear war over it numerous times.
Clearly the West isn't worried about it.
In case of Russia attacking NATO the conventional response would simply be aimed at neutralizing normal Russian military assets, both as a deterrent and to defang their conventional military capabilities.
Damn, now that is talent.
There's plenty of people that can't even get their shit in the toilet.
Just go stroll through a public restroom from time to time.
What was the missed opportunity was to establish closer relations with Ukraine at that point, probably because it would have required considerable investments and of course the nation was heavily beset by Soviet corruption as well.
I'd also say that relations with Russia were at the best they could be at that time and no one wanted to rock that boat.
