Edit: for the avoidance of doubt: I have a very decent to high salary in a hard working job and am still happy to pay the current 50 percent tax rate over my income, even if that money isn’t always spent optimally by the government.
Lol what?
Could you clarify what you think is happening in the UAE?
Do you think gay people are actively searched for and persecuted?
I can guarantee you that a lot of gay people are safer in the UAE than in their home countries.
I already said that I agree that rights need to improve but I genuinely am curious as to what you think it's like in these countries.
The only time police or the government will persecute a gay person is in the case of public displays of affection which is also the case for straight people (Dubai is also much more liberal with this than the rest of thr country).
‘Ridiculous’?
You mean just taxes.
Some people are greedy fucks who don’t want to pay their fair share.
Marketing.
People will flock anywhere if you tell them it's where people flock.
Dubai isn't the first desert tourist trap run by religious hypocrites to actively lean into the "sin.
".
