It was a little premature about how competitive other markets would be, but he took an approach that America couldn't fight it and had to adapt.
If I remember correctly it was less about comparative industrial advantage and, as you said, more about the labor pool.
He argued that America's comparative advantage (not wrongly, I think) is knowledge work.
And that investing in the STEMs and uncoupling workers' retirement prospects from a single employer would be necessary.
Both of which have happened.
Much of the resistance to and limitations on the New Deal in the 30s and 40s had to do with racism specifically, and a lot of the justification for tearing down the regulations and safety net has been either explicitly racist or dogwhistled; I occasionally run across old stories of people justifying a vote 'against their interests' (where their interests are implicitly assumed to be economic) by saying it'd hurt "them" more (where them clearly refers to minorities or black people in particular).
