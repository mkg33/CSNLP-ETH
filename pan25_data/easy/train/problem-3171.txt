And that’s the reason why we have a disparate legal system that favors white people and discriminated against minorities.
Maybe it shouldn’t be up to someone with a high school education to dictate what is legal and what isn’t.
Issue citations for everything illegal and let the court decide on enforcement/penalty.
If it’s too harsh we can elect officials to change the laws.
You know, how it’s supposed to work.
>A federal judge in Chicago has denied a motion seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to block Illinois’ assault weapons ban and a similar ordinance in Naperville.
U.S. District Judge Virginia Kendall ruled Friday that the Illinois and Naperville bans on selling assault weapons are “constitutionally sound.”.
Lol.
Yes you do.
Most states have procedures for removing any officer of the law (sheriff or otherwise).
I can't speak to Illinois specifically though.
A quick google showed me that both VA and NC have clear guidelines, with more than 20 seconds of searching maybe you'd find something more.
