Absolutely.
There are Christian denominations that will perform marriage ceremonies for gay couples in their churches.
(For example: Trinity Church in Copley Square in Boston, which is often mistaken for a cathedral, although it is Episcopalian.)
There are denominations that are welcoming.
In the case of my good friends, they did happen to be in a denomination that is welcoming to queer people.
(For one of them, not all of his family is; some are in a much more conservative church, and that's been a point of friction over time, obviously, since he switched churches, although he switched churches long before he came out, even.
).
It would be wonderful if our culture as a nation was more welcoming to same sex marriage, but even if you could get a bill passed that forces states to issue same sex marriage licenses with a simple majority of Congress, it would be almost immediately overturned by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional based on “states rights” doctrine- even faster than the (possibly inevitable anyway) overturn of Obergefell.
Oh no.
