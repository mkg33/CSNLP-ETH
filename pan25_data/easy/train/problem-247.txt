No, Serbia has not had a sudden change of heart.
They're just smart enough to not get drawn into this shit-show.
I expect them to continue to say stupid shit without actually doing anything.
Much as Luka has done (and I hope continues to do).
Even Luka, dumb as he is, isn't dumb enough not to realize being drawn into the war would put Belarus first up to be sacrificed by Putin.
There's nothing in it for him but destruction.
Serbia, too, is presumably sick of Russia sacrificing Serbians for the greater good of Russia.
BAHAHAHAHHA, Okay.
Russia does make a fair few missiles the whole "running out" thing is incorrect.
They have reached the hand to mouth point already and it reduces the tactical flexibility of Russia.
Absolutely.
Their biggest international action lately has been to pick some fights (about nothing â€” license plates in one case) with its neighbors, making them conveniently too busy to help Putin.
Just like Luka.
Unlimited resources and weapons?
Total bollocks, Russia is a corrupt shithole with an economy smaller than Italy's, this was pre invasion losses and sanctions.
It's also lacking skills and production assets...versus western production capabilities?
Really?
