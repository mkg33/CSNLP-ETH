They do support their allies in the region like Assad,Hezbollah, Houthis, Iraqi Shia, Hazaras.

I couldn’t hear your appeasement of scarily nationalistic tendencies, excuses for mass political apathy, and tolerance for authoritarianism over the deafening silence of the ‘innocent’ Russian society and the sounds of weekly Russian strikes (war crimes) on Ukrainian civilian targets.
Humanity isn't black and white.
People don't surrender their right to be treated as human simply because their leaders are abominable.
And treating the Russian people as if they're disposable trash to be casually harmed in a geopolitical game because you judge them to be responsible for the actions of their leaders is reckless and dangerous.
A major cause of World War II was a treaty that forced the ordinary people of Germany to pay for the crimes of their previous leaders.
