Case in point: Madison Cawthorn.
He's literally the only person the GOP has pushed out, and it's only because he said shit that was supposed to be kept on the DL that made his colleagues look bad.
That's the only no-no.
A big problem that is starting to surface though is the publicity and scandals around Santos have enticed a frenzy of bottom feeding GOP backroom operatives who understand the influence they can exert via a hapless moron like Santos and the access they can cultivate from being in the inner circle of a clueless, amoral congressman.
There is literally NO LOW TOO LOW.
The GOP has absolutely no shame and could not possibly care less about these scandals.
Their voters have made clear that being a shitty person is an electoral asset, not a detriment.
The only sin Republicans care about is hurting the election chances of other Repubs or negatively impacting their ability to be corrupt af.
No.
He and the Republican Party know they lie straight to our faces and they do not care.
A thousand more ‘scandals’ (lol) like this have come before just like more will come after.
This is non-news, and certainly nothing that will ‘bring down’ anyone like him or the other lying conservatives.
They couldn’t care less.
