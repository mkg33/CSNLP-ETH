And with western companies leaving Russia and the decline in Russian energy revenue it will be incredibly hard for Russia to function long term.
They don’t have enough internal tax revenue to fund their state so they rely on selling energy abroad.
As those sectors take hits and their ability to borrow money declines they’ll have to start making increasingly difficult choices about what to fund.
Absolutely.
We don't see and hear the same things Russians do, on the whole, because most Russians probably don't speak or read English, and outside of major cities, probably consume fairly limited media that comes from outside of Russia's borders (which is exactly how Putin needs it in order for his propaganda to work).
F-35 has this kit.
It's pretty fancy.
it simulates a stronger radar return than the aircraft.
I believe it also has some IR countermeasures.
IR is actually a much bigger threat than radar these days.
When IR sensors were privative you could spoof them with flairs.
Advanced IR stuff now a days knows what the image of the target looks like and can ignore a huge swath of the countermeasures.
Only thing that's going to work in the future is laser based countermeasures that fry/blind the sensors.
