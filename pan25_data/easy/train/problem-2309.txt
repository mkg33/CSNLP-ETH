Essentially bombing into the stone age isn't an option either only leaving decapitation strikes as option.
And with regards to those there isn't a level of escalation left after killing Soleimani.
With a single strike the US pretty much exhausted their entire arsenal of options.
The Iranians know this and that is why they are unhinged in their nuclear development.
There is a single option left in the Iranian case and that is the bombing of their enrichment and nuclear facilities essentially turning the conflict nuclear.
They are likely using the Ukraine war as headstart to get to the bomb faster than the US and Israel can think too deeply about bombing their facilities.
And by the looks of it they made it.
The articles states they have enough material for a few nuclear warheads.
They will likely keep that material at hand for now because unlike the US Iran still has a few escalation levels it can exhaust.
Probably forever.
They have been threatening for over 20 years.
At this point they seem like a paper tiger, at least in regards to attacking Iran directly.
Now if US got involved, all bets are off.
