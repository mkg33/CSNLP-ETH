It goes to the Senate.
Its a must-pass bill.
So either the Senate passes that bill, or balks.
If they balk, Biden grows a pair and announces from the Oval office that families won't have food on the table unless Republicans pass this bill.
Actually hold the line.
Use the bully pulpit and lay the responsibility squarely on Republicans.
Republicans vote for the bill or there is economic catastrophe.
If Republicans still balk, then you still hold the god damn line.
Nothing catastrophic will happen on day 1.
But now shit is real and there is a bill that can end it sitting in the Senate if only 10 Republicans vote for it.
They try and make the argument of "boo, I don't want to give workers a few days of sick time off."
vs you now have stores and companies starting to feel the hurt.
This should be an easy win for Democrats to paint Republicans in the bad light.
"Republicans only have to vote for this bill and the pain is over."
This is what a strong leader would do.
Biden took the easy and convenient way out.
Economic damage?
They should have thought about that when they decided to treat labor like indentured serfs.
