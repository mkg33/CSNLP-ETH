I’ve been following the NIF for over a decade.
And yes, we have had working fusion reactors for many years now.
We have never harnessed fusion power however.
In the context of this result, this is the first time energy put into the reaction has been exceeded by the reaction output (the laser energy has always been the benchmark for this experiment, as the laser generation happens outside the reaction vessel).
This is not a blueprint for a power plant though, as it isn’t scalable.
It is still a significant milestone, however.
This is actually a pretty significant step for them.
NIF was never designed to be a power plant prototype but rather a lab to better understand fusion reactions.
Along the way, they have been able to finesse further efficiency and optimizations.
They have had three major milestones: actual fusion reaction initiated, fusion reaction that nets positive from the target’s perspective (which I find slightly arbitrary), and fusion reaction that nets positive from the laser’s perspective (a very reasonable standard, and a seriously commendable achievement).
So.
Can Tom Hanks play the scientist who made the breakthrough discovery randomly while washing dishes and then he did some scribbles on the foggy window in front of him and figured it all out?
He wasn't paying attention to his family much, and now that he hands off his knowledge to the world he can focus on what's really important.
The simple things, and watching his kids grow.
