I know, this premise is shaky because nobody ever believed Ladas were safe, at least not before the second bottle of Vodka.
It's a fantastical ideology.
These supposed peaceful communities living in harmony "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" just happily trading with each other in that Garden of Eden state is nonsense the first premise we get in the book, neither in the Amazon nor anywhere else have we found such a system, this so called stateless idea is just flawed, those tribes although not a nation as we call it certainly have territory and war with each other for land and resources even when such things are in "abundance", this happens even in our much more advanced capitalistic world, which shouldn't be possible under their idea since late stage capitalism supposedly leads to Communism even with an abundance of goods to freely distribute, yet this hasn't happened, they've been waiting since what 1875?
Good luck.
Not to mention every time they try to implement their wonderful system they can neither get it right and end up fucking it up and killing untold millions and then say "Whoops it wasn't REAL Communism though hurr durr", it's shit.
And the people advocating for that ideology are a threat and should be treated and dealt with as such, and they will be.
They've had more failed revolutions than successful ones.
