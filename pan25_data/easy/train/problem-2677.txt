Genuine question.
He could go for 11 hours of deposition and come out cleaner on the other side.
Right now the GOP have this weird thing going where they imply that he's shady AF but have no actual evidence to support it.
That's why they focus on Hunter so much.

Probably de-fund that Consumer Protection Bureau and a bunch of other terrible shit.
