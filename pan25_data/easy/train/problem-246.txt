Remember that weird infomercial about refrigerators and washing machines?
It was some white woman and an Asian guy in a huge appliance store; I remember a specific scene where the Asian guy makes some cheesey joke about your "savings getting flushed down the drain".
This was beck in the early to mid 2000's, the infomercial was like half an hour long lmao.

I remember hearing an interview with Anne Applebaum -- a prominent journalist who's written extensively about Eastern European and Russian politics and isn't prone to hyperbole -- where she argued that Tucker Carlson champions so many Kremlin talking points and makes such specific references to false claims made by Putin about the Ukrainians that she has no doubt someone inside Russia is feeding him information.
His commentary is so consistent with Russian propaganda to the point that uses clips from his show to justify the war.
