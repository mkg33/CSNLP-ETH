Categorically insisting that an institution is above investigation for alleged misconduct simply because the institution's identity makes it a target for bigotry and bad-faith actors is a poor argument.
If you applied this principle universally, religious institutions and minority-led organizations would not be subject to legal investigation when their own employees report misconduct.
No it fucking does not!
It protects children, supports children and provides a bastion in this storm of shit you send our way.
No one understands the pain and harm we go through without empathy.

Obviously the MO AG has his own political agenda, but the political agenda doesn't nullify that these are allegations objectively warranting investigation.
The same way that it was still objectively warranted for the New York AG to investigate the NRA's financial misconduct even if her subjective motivation was political.
I live in StL and have a trans kid.
The allegations raised by the purported whistleblower do give me pause.
If true, and that's a big "if", the center may be over-diagnosing and over-treating people.
Being trans is absolutely real, and trans people are absolutely discriminated against.
If this one center has been loose with its protocols and treatment, I want that to be fixed, for the sake of all their patients, including my kiddo (who we are planning to take there).
