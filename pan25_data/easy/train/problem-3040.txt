Requirement without enforcement/punishment sets a baseline for larger reforms such as making voting day a state holiday, mandatory funding provided to districts to cover costs involved in voting (staffing and supplies), automatic registration, drop boxes, and universal mail ballots without the forced request process.
I'm torn on this.
On one side, I agree that more voter engagement is good because it makes the result of the election better match what the public wants.
In low turnout elections, a small highly motivated minority can elect a candidate very different from what the electorate wants.
Yeah this.
While I think this ultimately won’t work and probably will cause a PR problem, it isn’t a bad idea that making it so people are required to vote makes it so that suppression efforts suddenly become against the existing law.
This idea might not be it but I think it’s worth workshopping to see if there are other similar ideas that achieve the same effect.
