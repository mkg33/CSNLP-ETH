It was from the "Priorities for Research to Reduce the Threat of Firearm-Related Violence" report requested by the CDC, to make an agenda for research.
It's literally about topics they should focus on, when they start studying gun violence.
It's put together by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), in collaboration with the National Research Council (NRC) National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.
This isn't to say that you aren't right.
There are clearly populations which are much more given to believe they used their guns defensively or which actually use their guns defensively.
Poll police officers for instance, and you're going to get a drastically different result than if you poll, say, dockworkers.
Even accounting for that, security guards, storeowners, or private security will also have very real situations as part of everyday life where they are both in a position and have the tools to prevent crime with a gun.
Hence gun owners are even less likely to be involved with crimes, because most crimes are simply not occurring where they are to begin with, and they aren't likely to have their guns when the crimes do occur.
C. The number of people who carry guns daily given the number of crimes that occur outside of the home.
For even more reason to be skeptical, only about 5% of people carry their guns every day.
Unless those 8 million crimes are all occurring while the victim is home, the chances of having the gun are even less likely.
