But in some of these countries collaboration has been systematic - meaning that the government was encouraging it or facilitating it.
Polish government in 1939 and earlier (as holocaust started in 1933) was never encouraging it or faciliating it unlike some other european countries.
I live 3 km from Majdanek concentration camp, I can see the watchman towers and mausoleum from bus window when I pass it by since I was a little kid .
My grandpa was playing with children who died in that camp.
I walk through the park where once were jewish homes.
Imagine living next to the whole society that has been destroyed.
I still wonder how would by neighbourhood look like if WW2 never happened.
Anyways how many collaborators there have to be for the full society to be evil?1%?
5%?
20%?
Can u give me the number?
There has always been people with the consience and without one as long as the world goes.
And it has nothing to do with nationality.
I heard that the war or other borderline situation.
Honestly depending on the topic, Wikipedia has become completely unreliable.
On multiple occasions I've seen opinions inserted into articles linking to opinion headlines on CNN or Fox, as if something somebody said is now what actually happened.
Thank you.
I am not at all saying Poland is uniquely bad here.
All nations behave like this, and seek to do this to their own histories.
