America needs nationwide law enforcement reform, itâ€™s not even just the police at this point, ICE is an even bigger gang, FBI seems way more interested in arresting environmental protestors than actual white nationalist militias stockpiling weapons and openly threatening armed revolt if not outright carrying one out.
Fuck.
The more and more I'm reading about this situation... My stomach is uneasy right now.
George Floyd's murder made me cry and feel so much pain as a person.
The more comments I read, I'm not sure if it'll be the tears of tragedy or the tears of rage.
The vibes I'm getting is this will not be received well at all.

absolutely nothing.
but they're willing to pop journalists' eyes out with 40mm riot launchers, tear gas & pepper spray scores of people, maybe run some over with the squad cars.
which will in turn produce more videos of police brutality, and follow with more violence.
