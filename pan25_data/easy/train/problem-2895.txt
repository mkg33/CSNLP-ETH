Much of US military expenditures is related to pork spending in key congressional districts and money going to private contractors at significant markup, again, to benefit those who finance certain congresspeople.
We could get a lot more for a lot less if spending was really based on military need rather than lining pockets.
Additionally, we spend way more than any other country on our military.
We could financially cut back and still support Ukraine.
These republicans have made their support of russia in this conflict clear, and they certainly haven't espoused any pacifist leanings, so it's pretty easy to conclude they're hoping to disrupt support for Ukraine.
You can totally support Ukraine, including wanting them to be financially supported, while opposing the bloat in our defense budget.
Shhh.
Let republican tear each other apart about this.
They just ran over all women by making sure we know they will never respect our rights.
I hope this ends them , or at least half of them and it's fine if its the " moderate " half as then democrats win in that district.
