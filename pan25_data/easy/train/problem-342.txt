By definition this wasn’t an independent investigation.
Clearly.
I am not saying Chertoff is a bad guy but get someone who doesn’t have any previous ties to the court.
I mean come on.
This is stupid.
“For the first time, a nonpartisan government investigation Wednesday put principal blame on Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, not lower-level officials, for the fumbled response to Hurricane Katrina.
What can we do?
Is it just time to move?
I mean, I can.
I have an in-demand internationally accepted accreditation in healthcare, and money.
But many do not, and I would rather shit gets fixed here, rather than hop around the world.
I already did that, and I'm old and tired now.
The Government Accountability Office, an independent agency of Congress, said in its preliminary report that Chertoff had failed to move quickly to mobilize resources despite advance warnings that Katrina was likely to be a devastating storm.
And, the report said, Chertoff’s failure to name an individual to spearhead the response was a prime factor in the delays and confusion that followed.”.
