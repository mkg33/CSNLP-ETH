I think you're right.
NYT shows 20% of Pitkin County ballots have yet to be counted.
They are strongly blue.
So again, tell me how disliking a politician because theyâ€™re terrible humans, with bad policies, no real business being a politician because of lack of education and experience, and utter incompetence at her job is misogynist?
Yep, it's ranked choice.
Funny thing happened in the first election this year.
Enough of the people who voted for the other Republican chose the Democrat in that race.
I wouldn't be surprised if that happens again.
Right now it looks like the bottom three candidates are going to be dropped because dropping the bottom two won't change anything because there's not enough votes there to get a final outcome.
So that will leave just Palin and Peltola.
Let's give all those votes to Palin, just for simplicity.
Peltola still only needs about 3% of the total votes to switch to her to win.
That's only about 13% (rounded up) of the votes that the 3 candidate has.
