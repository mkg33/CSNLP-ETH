In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Not necessarily.
Bitcoin is not the only crypto currency out their and has long been beaten in terms of anonymity.
Pretty early on people identified the public ledger of transactions as a huge flaw, and in the past couple years it's become pretty well known that people can trace it with enough resources.
If they converted that shit into Monero then it would actually be untraceable, and if random drug dealers can figure that out, for all of the obvious incompetence surrounding Trump, I'd think they'd be able to figure that part out.
Yawn.
8 years into the "this time Trump is getting nailed" CNN headline and people are still clicking.
The investigation is not intensifying.
The need to further monetize post CNN+ failing is the only intensification in progress.
And more disingenuous commentary.
Not a SINGLE "left" person is saying not to investigate.
That's a GOP tactic.
We're awaiting the results of said investigations.
