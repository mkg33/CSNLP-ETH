They likely are.
Private Ukrainian civilians are likely the ones selling these and that means giving money directly to civilians aka humanitarian aid.
It would.
But that photo in Berlin is one of the most iconic photo taken during WW2 and without a doubt very powerful photo.
Imagine they switch USSR flag with Ukraine photo there.
Also, unless I'm missing something, I don't know how this photo is glorifying NATO?
Is that photo based on the current war or base on Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima?
Because if it's based on Iwo Jima, they should have done it based on the Russians raising flag in the Berlin instead.
It would hit their nerve.
It tends to go: Poland gives it immediately but hidden, the UK calls for aid to be given, US hints at it, EU says they will, Germany and the UK send it, the US follows up on it or with a newer system usually hidden so that Russia false reports jump the gun or claim it is having no effect except for the sudden halt, and the support comes flowing in as EU equipment gets added.
