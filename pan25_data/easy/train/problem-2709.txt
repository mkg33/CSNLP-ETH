Maybe an unpopular opinion, but while I like French food, a lot of it seems so heavy to me.
A lot of butters and fats and richness.
I tend to think that the US has a lot more diverse cuisine, even excluding all the fusions.
And it's funny that you think of American foods as all fusion, when most cuisines are.
You said pizza is one dish that's been Americanized, but Italian pizza is also basically a fusion.
They didn't even have tomatoes originally because tomatoes are from the Americas, so many of their dishes never existed as they do now.
Can anyone imagine Italian without the tomato?
Much of the world's cuisines are like that.
How we all eat now is very different than how it was before the great Columbian Exchange.
So what exactly is "traditional" in that case?
What is real and not real?
Every country has foreign influences.
Try naming an age old "traditional" dish that doesn't mix new world foods (chili, tomato, potato, corn) and old world foods.
Completely disagree.
There are plenty of exclusively regional American cuisines and dishes that aren't just fusion.
