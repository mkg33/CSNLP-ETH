The US doesn't need to train fighter pilots.
Ukraine already has those, some of them highly experienced in actual combat operations.
It needs to train F-16 pilots.
A bunch of the training (which assumes no experience) can be shortened or skipped.
There would still be a significant amount of training.
However the war has already been going on for almost a year, and it sure would have been nice if Ukrainian pilots had already been doing that training for the past year.
Then they might actually be ready to fly the F-16 in 2024 or 2025, when the war might still be ongoing.
Logistics.
The only ones in Europe that have m1s are the poles that have 7 training ones expecting the first batch of actual ones in 2024.
That's irrelevant.
Germany has a bunch of retired 2A4s (which is what it would actually send if it decided to), which it has already replaced, and Germany could also give the go-ahead to other countries to send their L2s.
None of this requires Germany to send what it doesn't have.
Some of it doesn't require Germany to send anything at all.
