Shooting unarmed medics and civilians is ALSO a warcrime, Israel is gonna have to employ military forces on these fuckheads to save civilians and the holy place that is Jerusalem(before you ask yes I am Jewish).
Bro.
Israel ain’t returning to no 1948 borders.
Why don’t we just return to the 1010 BCE borders of the Kingdom of Israel??
The 1967 borders are considered the international sovereign borders of the state of Israel.
But even a return to those borders is realistically not going to happen.
Eventually, there will be a return to the 1967 borders but with fair and reasonable land exchanges between each side.
The IDF primarily retaliates.
IDF policy is to retaliate with disproportionate force.
Preemptive strikes are dictated by actionable intel of an imminent attack and location of a staging area or rally point, or cell HQ.
Basically.
Palestine is full of literal terrorists and Israel receives rocket fire all the time.
The west only really hears something when some Israeli kills someone.
