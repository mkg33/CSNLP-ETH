let's be even handed here, Israel is the UN's first project so everyone who opposes Israel tries to use the UN as if it was the fire of mount doom.
choose one, those aren't contradictory, but the notion of Israel being enabled if not outright created by the UN is a common one among their enemies.
if you want to be pedantic and absurdly detailed - Israel wasn't founded by the "Jews who won the war" but rather the Jews who lived in the mandate of Palestine since before it was the mandate of Palestine, as Zionist (as in Jewish people who advocate for a Jewish homeland in old Judea) settlements have been there since the ottoman empire, Ben-Gurion being the best example.
they formed the structure of what became the state of Israel, did the fighting since the 20s when the Arabs originally wanted to expel them.
Ha-Yishuv, look it up.
48 was the culmination, not the beginning of the existential struggle.
Exactly.
Israel wins the PR battle with high society (corporations, governments (even Arab governments), security and intelligence agencies around the world, and R&D institutions), but with the average person around the world, they generally lose.
The average person thinks that Israel is just one giant CIA/MI5, something to be regarded as suspicious and to be feared.
Amazing.
“Israel isn’t unfairly singled out because other countries get sanctioned by the EU and US” is a helluva take.
