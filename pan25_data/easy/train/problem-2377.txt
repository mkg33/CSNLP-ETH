Not too long ago a terrorist shot a soldier dead in a checkpoint, the driver that took him there turned himself in because he didn't know he's gonna shoot someone.
He was not charged.
Remember This shooting attack was a direct or indirect result of Israeli army killing 9 Palestinians with months what Israeli government doing is just making terrorists its an endless loop if you really think arresting innocent people would decrease the number of terrorists think again.
you see?
the difference is that Israel targets militias and terrorist organizations while the palestinians target civilians leaving a praying site.
They're just arresting them now.
There's no punishment, for now.
But what does it say about the parents that their son went and shot Jews praying at the synagogue.
Or his siblings.
And one more thing, what is the thing that determines whether the attackers launched a terrorist attack or just resistance against an occupier, I think the answer is easy as you said if he attacks civilians he is a terrorist and we all agree with that, but what if he's Palestinian or Ukrainian or whatever, grab a gun and fought the occupying forces would you call him a terrorist ?
the most Important question would Israel handle the attack differently for example wouldn't arrest the attacker relatives and kick them out of their homes I don't think so.
Lol, you literally said that Israel targets innocent civilians who all they do is just be relatives of someone who did terrorist attacks that's the most radical thing I had ever heard.
No you mean to help terrorists organisation with attracting more people that's only show Palestinians that's Israel is shit and the hate is justified.
