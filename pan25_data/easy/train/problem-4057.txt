The thing is, Turkey is not playing with Russia.
Turkey is just being a massively self-centered prick.
But their interests don't align with the Russian ones at all.
You know, stuff like proxy fighting against Russians in Lybia, proxy fighting (and sometimes direct) against them in Syria, Turkish support of Azeris and dealing with Armenia, conflicting interests in weapons manufacturing sectors (Turkey is positioning itself to become a major arms exporter in next decades), conflicting interests in the energy sector, Turkish hard stance against Iran, etc.
But their interests at certain points also align against the rest of NATO, like in their stance to Kurds, wanting to advance in Syria, wanting to kick out various refugees, wanting to take over more exclusive maritime zones in the Mid sea, etc.
Are you joking me?
They're the worlds largest gas exporter, and 2nd largest oil exporter in the world.
So argument over there, but here's more.
Please also note Russia is not the USSR, many other countries made vital contributions to the USSR's achievements in space, particularly Ukraine is worthy of mentioning, as they had some very capable design teams, as with the war, it is important to differentiate between Russia and the USSR, while Russia may have inherited equipment from it's time in the USSR it the capacity to build that equipment was scattered throughout the USSR and some of the factories and skilled workers were in Russia and others were not...

Demographically, Russia's population is shrinking, and it is also ageing, which implies a smaller total workforce and higher expenses for eldercare.
The longer the war goes on, the more young Russians die (the majority of the dead are between 20-30), and the more will emigrate from the country.
My guesstimation is that Russia will have serious long-term problems if 500.000 Russians die in this conflict.
That would exacerbate the demographic problems so much that it will be extremely difficult to recover.
