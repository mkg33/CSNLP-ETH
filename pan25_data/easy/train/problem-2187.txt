Seriously though, I am interested in finding out if Trump's presence does indeed blow up the GOP's efforts to win the Georgia runoffs, and if that could be weaponized against Republicans in future elections if so.
Two elections — the 2024 GOP presidential primary and the Republicans’ underwhelming showing in the midterms — have heightened the debate over Trump’s role in the party.
Many in the GOP blame Trump for the poor midterm showings, nothing that several Senate and gubernatorial hopefuls that he elevated through primaries had flopped in the general election.
And those aspersions have complicated Trump’s nascent presidential campaign.

Republicans vote R regardless of policy.
Republicans are crying that their states ban abortion despite them voting for anti abortionists.
Not because of rights but because of personal convenience.
