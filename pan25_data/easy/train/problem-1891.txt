Unlike Russia, ruled by a dictator who spent decades clearing the political landscape of any viable competitors, and thus removing whom would plunge the country into anarchy and a power struggle, in Ukraine, little would change.
Zelensky is a effective administrator and public face, and losing him might make Ukraine's PR a bit rougher (even his Russian enemies commend him on how effective his PR has been at getting Ukraine the aid it needed), but unlike Putin, he is not a one-man show.
Any of the people who are likely to replace Zelenskyy (Zaluzhny, Yermak, etc.)
are very likely to continue the same course, and Ukraine is no longer at the critical stage it was early in the invasion, where a brief power vacuum could destabilize the state apparatus and lead to a collapse or surrender.
Exactly.
Like how exactly is this conflict going to become a nuclear war unless you, yourself, start launching nukes?
Or attack a NATO country?
The ball is in Russia's court and they deflated it.
Single-handedly?
I’m pretty sure a few million Ukrainians would beg to differ.
Aside from that…agreed…his poor and paranoid leadership has definitely increased corruption and made Russia weaker.
