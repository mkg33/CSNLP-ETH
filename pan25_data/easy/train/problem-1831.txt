There's a huge, huge difference between Russia and what you're referring to.
China is an internal conflict which is way more complicated but on a very different scale than that of Ukraine.
It also destabilizes China and impacts the chinese where as Ukraine destabilizes an entire region like Europe and impacts dozens of countries.Russia has threatened the world with Nuclear holocaust as the world's largest nuclear arsenal and well over 100k people have died in Ukraine.
They're actively kidnapping children, raping and terrorizing a whole country.
Its not comparable at all.
Overblown?
With the amount of racism and xenophobia we see EVERY DAY?
We just saw the George Floyd incident, but the majority of these don't receive enough attention to become huge as this case was.
It still happens at an alarming rate.
Nobody likes what's happening, but his promise in the elections was to reestablish our foreign relations and telling Russia to go fuck themselves wouldn't help that much, especially now that Bolsonaro shut down our fertilizer factories (made by Lula and Dilma over 10 years ago) and we became heavily reliant of Russia once again.
