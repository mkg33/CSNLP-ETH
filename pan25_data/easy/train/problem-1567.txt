What should be noted is that the Greens had a plan to replace nuclear.
They didn't really create this "demand" of coal.
To get rid of nuclear they also decided to massively fund renewables, which were just a niche way of creating energy, to jump start them.
This plan did work, but in the 2010s the coalition of CDU and FDP decided to slow down renewable to a screeching halt, and they killed the solar industry in Germany.
succesfully slowing down renewables and killing off an entire industry sector was something Altmaier ( minister for economy and energy ) saw as a success, as something positive.. Oh and in the later 2010s wind was also slowed down.
Not to a degree like solar but still.
Absolute bullshit.
You will always need a base load; a task renewables simply can't fill.
Moreover, Germany ,of%20wind%20and%20solar%20power) renewable energy, so it's hypocritical to single out nuclear energy in that regard.
So what was the plan again?
They never and still don't lay out a plan for the energy storage problem at scale, and before you don't solve that you can't only use renewables.
