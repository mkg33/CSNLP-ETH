Thatâ€™s what they said.
Probably there was no ammo there as the Russians have stopped stockpiling ammo like that since HIMARS kept fucking up their supply.
More likely it was a GIMLRS that arrived and simply collapsed the supports of the building and it pancaked down onto itself.
If there were stored ammo there, the cellphone vids would have been epic, with ammo cooking off for up to several hours.
Anybody that is pro-democracy and still trying to deny how politically, morally, strategicly, and logistically logical it is for NATO and more specifically America to continue supporting Ukraine from Russian expansionism and authoritarianism needs to seriously reconsider their source of information and/or train of thought.
I don't either.
If the people wanted the war to stop they would have mobilised much like Iran did.
Yet all we saw were minor isolated protests that were quickly handled.
The majority of the Russian people support the war and are thus complicit in the destruction of Ukraine.
No sympathy from me.
