I think the thing that was so hard for a lot of us to get was that Trump was the avatar for your angry racist uncle who peaked in the 80’s.
He embodied everything they wanted to be.
Rich, hot wife, got applauded for making lazily offensive jokes.
DeSantis, I don’t think he embodies a single thing anyone wants to be.
A lot of conservatives like what he does, but nobody likes what he IS.
They don’t flock to the way he talks or the way he acts, and for the team that’s basically a personality cult, that feels like it would be a non-starter.
It would be interesting to see if DeSantis actually stands any real chance on a national stage.
Charisma.
Biden, when he does talk in public, is very charismatic.
He always has been.
Even in his old age, he has charm.
Ron De Santis has, by every account, the personality of a dish rag.
The job of president has had a heavy media focus since Kennedy.
That won't change and that leads me to my next point.
