The Renminbi will never become the world reserve currency under the current communist party rule.
America is the only country strong and stable enough to not care that other countries use their currency to trade or that this reserve status pushes up the cost of their export goods.
China on the other hand is constantly try to manipulate and control its currency, which is the last thing one would want from a global reserve currency.
The Euro will be a reserve currency long before the Renminbi ever will.
A few Russian oligarchs trying to shelter their assets is not going to change this; they will still need USD to buy the things they really want.
autocracy.
Which is exactly what the Republicans want as far as I know them except they also want a religious bent.
So their ideal nation is basically Iran, an autocratic capitalist theocracy terrorist sponsor.
This is what I don't get.
As a GenXer, let me assure you guys that the Russians have always been the bad guys, and likely always will.
Sure, China's a rising worry, and we took a long detour with the "War on Terror" thing.
