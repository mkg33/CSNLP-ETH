Supposedly the number is supposed to be 30% of Republicans.
Which won't get you a win the general election but could very well be enough to win the Republican Primary.
I think many believe he won't be able to win a general election by now.
However even those claiming he doesn't deserve to be elected again or wouldn't vote for him in the Primary will also tell you if he wins the Republican Primary they will not hesitate voting for him over a Democrat and that includes those who resigned from his administration in protest and some who actually testified against him in the Jan6 committee hearings.
all you had to do was google it.
There have been several peer reviewed studies from reputable sources such as Yale and the National Bureau of economic research that show republicans were significantly more likely to die from Covid.
Yep, that’s a good thing.
He’s not winning votes and he’s done nothing but lose votes.
The problem as I see that even if Trump fails Trumpism and his base still remain.
Hell, their next best choice is DeSantis and he‘s just as if not more dangerous to the Republic than Trump was.
