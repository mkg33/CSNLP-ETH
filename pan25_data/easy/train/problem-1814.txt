Can confirm.
Was a functional alcoholic for about a decade, am an attorney, worked way up to a VP position at a top bank, good relationship.
All it took was dabbling in certain substances in order to “control” the amount of drinking I was doing to fully throw me off the deep end.
After 2 stints in detox and a rehab I’ve now been sober for a few months and getting my life back on track.
But the AA standard for alcoholism is that your life becomes unmanageable and it is a 100% certainty for alcoholics.

Amazing story.
Are you me btw??
Also was using a bunch of K for “depression” but depression is a major symptom of addiction.
Had also been taking benzos for years but luckily my doc said no way when I told him about rehab.
Still getting my bearings trying to sleep on my own but it’s definitely much better than it was.
I’d also take benzos for “sleep” but I would just end up staying up all night anyway getting fucked up.
Congrats on your sobriety!
You have an awesome story.
