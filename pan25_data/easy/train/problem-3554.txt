You went directly to insults instead of actually justifying your claim and cool your 10 year old son is more articulate than me he’s probably smarter than you are if you aren’t the one educating him.
How about you actually try to argue something rather than bringing your kid into it.

Cool the democrats are the ones who wanted to keep slavery a thing and the president who quote on quote a rights activist voted against integrating schools in 1960s the Democratic Party is a joke they just hide behind the woke movement which is just an oppressive movement because they say they want justice for all but they forgot to mention only the people that think like them and go ahead and say white supremacists racist transphobic homophobic because you guys have used these terms so much they don’t mean anything because anyone who doesn’t think like you has to be according to democrats and sorry some of us don’t want the country to go in a socialist direction.
