Bro, you are wrong here.
In India, we are not taught to hate through textbooks or anything.
For a 15 year old kid in India from lower middle class, religion/politics is not anywhere in their mind.
Talking about history books, in India, modern history is not taught in text books.
I learned about 47/48, 65, 71 from encyclopedias.
Hell, being 33 yo, I learned about Pakistan's existence during the Kargil war.
And I studied in a school that was managed by RSS.
However, I agree that in the last 10 years media has been used in India for propagation of hate.
IMHO it's not baseless.
The involvement of Pakistani terrorists has killed too many here.
And that's the basis of hate.
Explain Musharraf, the army control, ISI, Sunni Fundamentalism, Bangladesh independence, etc.
to Jinnah if he were alive and he’d have a heart attack.
This isn’t actually uncommon.
My grandfather fought in the second world war and died a few years at 95.
His wife is still alive at 91.
My great grandmother, while no one knows her exact age, is at least 100.
Plenty of Pakistanis live well into old age.
