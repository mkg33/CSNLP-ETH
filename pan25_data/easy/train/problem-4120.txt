The actual report just argues that each member should consider it and that the UN could help draw up frameworks that could inform and assist them in the process.
Corporations only satisfy average citizens' demands.
If the average Joe renounced all non-basic consumerism, most corporations would disappear overnight.
Nobody's holding a gun to our heads and forcing us to consume.
Nobody.
We do that because, we, too, are greedy bastards.
Not only corporations, the average Joe too is greedy as fuck.
Edit: international institutions wish they were effectively domestic laws with international consensus.
They'd have a lot more power if they were.
But that's how every international justice system/international law works - domestic adoption by every single signatory.
Even the ICC has no jurisdiction a) if a country has not ratified the Rome Statute, or b) if a country tries the case itself.
When the US didn't like the outcome of an ICJ case the US simply quit and nobody could do anything about it.
International law is just domestic law by international consensus (or pressure for smaller/weaker countries).
I get what you mean, though.
If, hypothetically, this somehow did get a bunch of countries to create laws that were mechanically similar, then it would spread and be enforced via pressure and trade in a similar fashion to international systems.
Stronger countries would largely be able to ignore that pressure.
And, of course, provided they went through whatever processes they have for repealing a law, the stronger countries could get out of it.
