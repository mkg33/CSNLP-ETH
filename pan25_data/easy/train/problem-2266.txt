Oh no Not more incriminating evidence Looks like he's in huge trouble now, for the 537th time in a row since 2015.
I'm so goddamn tired of this.
It boggles my mind how we've been fed a steady stream of media, movies, and television that suggest prosecutors are hard-hitting, no-nonsense types of people, and yet in reality we find out they spend most of their time hiding in their offices wringing their hands and pissing their pants.
They only seem to get motivated if it's a person of color with a low-level drug offense, or to seek vengeance against someone who committed the unpardonable sin of stealing from the 1%.
Honestly, that's the only time a rich person will ever go to jail in this country - if they steal from another rich person.
Our justice system is a heaping pile of bullshit.
Illogical as expected.
They have been working on it but very slowly and without purpose.
Don’t know where the “ 1/6 committee was angry enough” is coming from but adds nothing to your point and in fact detracts.
Literally.
