Drones were considered too difficult to effectively use in combat (no..
seriously.)
the drones we invented are wildly expensive, prohibitively so, and it was assumed against a legit state like Russia they would have tech to wipe out drones with ease.
Our nano drones are a good example of this.
They’re stupidly expensive, they use a controller straight from 1998, their signal is unreliable, the info they provide troops is minuscule in the grand scheme of things.
Our suicide drones are not that effective for their price, switchblades for instance the 300 is weak AF and cost over $6k per craft for a grenade about as powerful as a VOG.
It was assumed special forces or whatever could use these to target individuals, but the idea of entire drone units, that’s too expensive.
Then came Ukraine.
They’re hunting Russians and slaughtering them every day with a reusable $700 DJI drone with a rigged up release pin and a $50 grenade.
It can drop a bomb and go home.
It can head back out a few minutes later.
It can loiter in the air and provide real time 4K feeds.
It terrorizes soldiers in trenches .. and you can buy them in bulk on Amazon.
That’s truly revolutionary.
It completely changes things.
Every movement on the battlefield is being watched.
They don’t need expensive sats, obvs planes or risky positioning for intel.
They just need a cheap ass Chinese drone and they can wreck havoc on a world power.
This isnt even a new technology, Ukraine is just the first to say hey, why can’t we just strap a cheap bomb to this?
Boom.
Changes everything.
Every army in the world, every insurgency, every terror organization, is frantically taking notes on what Ukraine has done with drones.
Seriously.
We're having our dreaded WW3 except it's limited to just 2 nations in direct conflict, no nukes, no wartime rationing outside Ukraine and we're not really spending any money to do it.
