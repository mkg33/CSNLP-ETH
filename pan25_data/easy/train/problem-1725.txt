There had never been Olympics in South America, so even though it didn’t go well I think it’s good to try to give a continent a shot (it is easier for people to go see them for one if it’s on the same continent).
Africa never has had one either.
So even though Egypt has a lot of issues I think they should get a change at some point, they clearly want it since they have are building an Olympic village in their new capitol.
It's insanity.
Cities run up massive debt then the facilities degrade over years.
I really like the idea of a single location for the Olympics.
Make top notch facilities that are maintained and upgraded.
Athens is the clear choice for summer.
Winter would be more difficult to determine though.
That's actually hilarious.
I can imagine some sneering MBA marketing type chuckling around having very few swimming prizes and tons of prizes for things like pole vault (Sergei Bubka), etc.
- only to get fired later when the idea totally backfired.
Edit for clarification.
I'm referring to the Russian athletes and their support staff, not people seeking asylum trying to escape the Russian government.
