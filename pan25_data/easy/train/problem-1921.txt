Would you say Selling a custom service is not really ‘art’?
If you accept commissions for money, its less art and more of a service.
If i take paid art commissions, and Im good at drawing dogs but someone pays me to draw a cat, I shrug and draw a ho-hum cat and collect the money.
Im not swearing before god in a church with a hand on the bible that I love cats, I just didn’t have my heart in it cause its not my thing, and made a few bucks.
Probably wont happen again when they see how lack-luster the cat is too.
If I exclusively draw angles and crosses, and do it for my religion, not for money, or a business, then it would be wrong for someone to force me to start a business and accept commissions.
Religion, and religious beliefs should not be business.
If she designs wedding websites as a religious activity, then do so for free, not as a business.
If she wants to run a business, then accept all customers without discrimination.
