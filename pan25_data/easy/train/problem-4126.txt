No problems there in Mesa County and Delta, which collectively have about 6,000 votes left to count.
She's been doing well, and will probably pick up at least a thousand votes in those counties.
The problem comes in with Garfield and Pueblo (also Pitkin, though that's got a very low margin left to count).
Collectively, Garfield and Pueblo have about 19,000 of the votes she needs to break her way.
Those have gone significantly for Frisch; even in the event that they do end up breaking her way (EDay vote batches), they haven't gone significantly her way.
Last batch from Pueblo, for instance, was +95 Boebert from a 4,000 vote dump.
Because of that, I still don't entirely see the math for a comeback for her.
There'll be a recount, but I don't think Boebert wins this.
Nebraska state legislature went filibuster proof majority for republicans yesterday.
Throw in a batshit crazy Governor and itâ€™s not looking so hot for abortions in our state.
At least we got $15 minimum wage last night ðŸ¥² small wins where we can.
