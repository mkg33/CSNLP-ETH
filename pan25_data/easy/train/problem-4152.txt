That is dirt cheap when you compare it to several other states.
You have no state income tax there, so you also don't get that hit.
After the 2017 tax bill capped the SALT deduction, I couldn't even write off all my property taxes let alone any other state and local tax where I live because where I live our property taxes are on average somewhere between 2-5x what Florida hits people for.
Average house price where I live was 450k before the pandemic, and as of this year it is 800k, and the average property taxes are close to 10k on the lower end in a lot of cases.
The neighborhood where my parents live is well upwards of that too, like their tax bill is 18k a year just for the house before insurance or anything else.
Phrenology?
Come on, that's not fair.
Give them a little credit.
You have to manually inspect every head that way, the upside is way too low.
It's no way to build revenue growth.
Tonics, on the other hand...you get some dirty ditchwater, bottle it up, and bam!
Now you're moving some real product.
