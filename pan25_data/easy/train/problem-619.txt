Mädchen, a girl, isn't actually neutral gender.
Well, it is but only because it's the diminutive form which is always neutral gender.
Mädchen is diminutive for Maid which is female gender and means young woman/girl.
But Maid went out of fashion, the word isn't used in modern German anymore.
The diminutive form became the modern word and kept its neutral gender.

It's more of a question how hard they want to fuck up their own future.
