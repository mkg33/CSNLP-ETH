American politics is a joke.
It’s everyone’s fault because people believe in BS.
If all you watch or listen to is right wing News you brainwashed to think America is doomed.
This all started when Barack Obama was elected president and was elected to two terms.
They thought Donald Trump would get two terms and change American politics for Republican gain.
Trump lost and then it was election fraud, change the constitution, and change the courts.
Make it harder to vote and do not compromise with any democrat legislation.
It’s like everyone has a mental illness because it’s never been this bad.
Americans have to vote for sane politicians on both sides and govern for the people not your ego.
Incorrect.
While I agree with you that shutting down that strike was wrong, this incident wouldn’t have been prevented with increased sick leave.
It happened because the rail companies are using fewer workers and longer, less adequately manned trains.
The strike didn’t address that issue, it addressed a symptom of it.
It wouldn’t have stopped rail companies from running the trains the way they do.
