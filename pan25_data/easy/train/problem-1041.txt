It wasn't that long ago that Russia easily took Crimea, or put down resistance in Chechnya... That is the thing though, when people think your are strong you can kind of do whatever you want.
Now that people know they are weak, there is nothing they can do but holler like a toddler and smash their fists into the ground.
They only reason this war is still going is because the international community does not want Russia to collapse, more do the want to go in and take over.
No one knows what to do at this point and are hoping the Russians figure something out to keep their country in one piece...
It is a huge fucking mess, and keeps getting worse...
Attacking UA, raping, pillaging & destroying all within is acceptable, but retaliatory attacks are not permissible?
The mindset!
Well before globalisation was a thing, the classic strat for civilizations with poor economy is to raid your prosperous but hopefully less military driven neighbours, hopefully enslave some people , plunder riches and broker a good deal in the process lol.
