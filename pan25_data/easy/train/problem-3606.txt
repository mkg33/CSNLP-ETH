We've known since the 80s that there are too many college grads for jobs that don't require a college degree, but your parents, grandparents and out of touch business leaders keep pushing this nonsense that people should be getting college degrees for basic jobs that should have on the job training instead.
Free?
Nation wide, average tax payer pays about $3500 a year to fund public education.
If you live to 80 you’ll end up paying around AN ADDITIONAL $200,000 for your “free” higher learning education.
Whether you want it or not.
Education is extremely important to be successful IMO, but I'm convinced the American college system isn't actually about educating individuals, its about gating access to the modern economy.
This here.
The teacher's assistants in our school district require an Associate degree.
This is a job that pays a bit over $15 an hour.
That's a $20k a year job that requires a college degree, absolutely ridiculous!
We really need to get away from the idea that every jobs needs a college degree.
