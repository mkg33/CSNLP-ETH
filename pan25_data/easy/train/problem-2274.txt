Sane or insane I don’t know and it’s not really my place to judge.
I DO know that for the last 100 odd days this man has watched what was happening to his people.
Being far away there was nothing he could do but watch as 10 & 12 yos were shot & killed while driving home with their families.
Watch as 6-8 yo girls walking to school are shot & killed.
Watch while teenage girls disappear from protests only to turn up in the morgue with severe trauma to their private areas, organs missing, bashed in heads and the families are told they committed suicide.
100 days of waiting for calls from his family and praying for their safety.
Knowing if he spoke out about what is happening he would be endangering his family living in Iran.
100 days of frustration and sadness watching his people be kidnapped, tortured & killed and not being able to do anything to help or stop it.
100 days only seeing news about his home if he went searching for it.
Horrible.
Even worse to me is the people that set themselves on fire in protest.
Ever seen someone burn to death, I have, I can't even fathom that level of pain.
