Scamming breeders out of puppies by claiming cheque fraud just seems unnecessarily elaborate and convoluted compared to just… easily and cheaply acquiring litters of unwanted street puppies.
Occam’s razor and such.
They have thoroughly abandoned any pretext of actual policy beyond fuck socialism and fuck wokeness.
They have little to nothing in the way of actual solutions to the problems of their base, aside from swapping the IRS for a 30% federal sales tax and privatizing social security.
(Something which would devastate the vast majority them).
Their policies are increasingly unpopular (overall) as their base that held to "classic" republican/conservative values ages out of the population.
The only "growth sector" has been doubling down on opposing progression on social issues, appeals to glorious past (that didn't exist for most of us), and finding an 'other' that's really the one to blame for the disappearance of the American Dream™.
And of course the authoritarianism necessary to enact those policies.
