Vermont passed a constitutional amendment protecting reproductive liberty on Election Day.
(It had, obviously, been in the works long before the Dobbs decision.
Getting the state constitution amended is a multi-year process, the timing just worked out well.

There’s a lot of great food (especially southeast Asian food due to the amount of refugees Minnesota has historically taken in), access to outdoor amenities is insane (seriously I live in one of the most dense neighborhoods in the city and I’m still only one block away from a bike path that connects within a mile to a chain of lakes that are surrounded by city parks and bike paths - and that’s not to mention things like easy access to the North Shore of Lake Superior), and you get the advantages of a huge city with relatively tame COL.
The latter is probably due to the cold… but we have some of the best summertime weather of anywhere in the US on the flip side.
