Since most of the developed nations have the fortune of having piped energy source and thus have been able to move away from coal to gas/petroleum.
Most developed countries use gas/petroleum based power plants.
But they keep on targeting only coal which is used predominantly by developing countries.
In short, India wants phasing out of all kinds of fossil fuels simultaneously from both developing and developed countries.
If only coal is phased out, developing countries would need to construct gas/ petroleum based power plants till they have sufficient renewable infra to substitute, or go on massive infra spending on renewables right now.
So, if developed countries are really serious about phasing out fossil fuels, why not all fossil fuels, why should developing countries be forced to spend money right now while developed countries can sit around using their gas powered plants for longer period of time.
