Acetaldehyde is carcinogenic in humans.
[42][43] In 1988 the International Agency for Research on Cancer stated, "There is sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of acetaldehyde (the major metabolite of ethanol) in experimental animals.
"[44] In October 2009 the International Agency for Research on Cancer updated the classification of acetaldehyde stating that acetaldehyde included in and generated endogenously from alcoholic beverages is a Group I human carcinogen.
[45] In addition, acetaldehyde is damaging to DNA[46] and causes abnormal muscle development as it binds to proteins.

Well, your claim that “everyone I know has had an increasingly impaired memory and weakened executive functioning” doesn’t appear to be footnoted which means it’s just your opinion and is completely worthless, other than as your opinion.
I somehow doubt any research has been done on your small group of acquaintances.
If I’m wrong, I would be interested to see it.
