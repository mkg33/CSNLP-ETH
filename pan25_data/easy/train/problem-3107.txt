I also watched "Green men" taking over a Ukrainian military airfield in Crimea.
The Ukrainian airmen had refused to surrender and were given a deadline.
They did not have orders (government in disarray after Yanukowich fled) and not really weapons to defend themselves, but refused to leave.
In the end the Russian troops came up to the entrance to go in and take the Ukrainian soldiers prisoner.
Therw was a webcam sat on the lightpole at the entrance, where we could watch.
The Russian commander clearly wanted no evidence, so he took out his sidearm and shot a full clip at the camera.
Missed.
New clip, grazed the camera so screen fractured a bit, still worked.
Third magazine he managed to shoot the camera loose from the pole.
But the thing was connected by wire, so it fell and got arrested by the wire, so it hung upside down, still showing the entrance.
After a while someone came and told him that the camera was still operational, so he sent a soldier up the pole.
Fell down twice before he managed to knock it down with his rifle.
Whatever happens tomorrow.
No matter the number of weapons Russia throws at them for the anniversary.
We will continue to back Ukraine.
Biden made that extremely clear.
