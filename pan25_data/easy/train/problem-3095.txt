Trump cleared out those he perceived to be non-loyalists, hoping he could get the army to side with him.
Exactly.
I still can't fathom why Trump was not arrested and put in Jail that day for an insurrection against America.
That criminal is still walking around free and still claimimg he won and the election was rigged.
Are justice department is the biggest joke I've ever seen in my entire life.

Secondly, the avoid over-exaggeration.
Everything with Trump is either beautiful or a.
Disaster.
He harps on the perceived wrong until it is entirely out of proportion with reality.

Urgently.
And they have no venue to act- the problems require laws to fix issues.
So his base is stirred up with no place to go.
Then he denigrates the opposition- they want to destroy America.
That creates a hatred of the opposition and since theyâ€™re already stirred up, you get political violence.
