Just because greed is part of human nature does not mean we should just embrace or encourage it.
We should expect it and safeguard against it.
Profit should never come before people.
Especially in areas that people rely on, like healthcare.
Our system makes a virtue out of greed, instead of treating it like a conflict of interest with the people like it is.
Yes that's true, but my problem with capitalism is that it makes a virtue out of bad and antisocial behaviors.
Not all economic systems do that.
In order for capitalism to work for the people, we need much stronger regulation in place and we need to remove the ability for corporations to influence politics at all.
Make that shit illegal and give the government back to the people.
Not just the news divisions, also sports, the television stations, and a few other bits that were spun off into Fox Corporation at the same time; presumably more to avoid monopoly scrutiny over ownership of competing news and sports broadcasters than concerns over the content (Disney already owned ESPN and ABC).
