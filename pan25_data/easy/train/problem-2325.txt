That is a lot of words for "whataboutism".
The simple fact, as stated above, is that while others may not be perfect either, this does not excuse Serbian actions (and let's not get into China and Russia, which are downright evil at this point).
And, in this case, Serbians are very clearly wrong.
So you should stop trying to excuse them.
And voting independance and ripping apart european countries is a recipe for another large european war because almost every european country is multiethnic to a certain degree - the recipe for peace is learning to live toher in peace, not ripping territories off.
Than your propaganda comes in place and you all think an entire nation is genocidal, and some EU countries go ceuing for help to USa to help the terrorists invade the land of a sovereign country in order to provide them a safehouse in the middle of the europe.
Not even nearly the same.
Serbia did not have Russia invading it.
They wouldnâ€™t need to invade serbia though.
They would just roll over and accept it since they are just a proxy now.
