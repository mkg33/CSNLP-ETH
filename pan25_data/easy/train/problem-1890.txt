Even if you don’t watch the news you would have to be intentionally ignoring every source of media to not be aware of what has been going on for over a year.
And that’s unfortunate if people have family in Russia, but if you choose to go back there, you can’t say there haven’t been countless warnings for American citizens who travel to Russia.
Entirely ethical?
Maybe not.
But we're talking about Russia, who are currently attacking a sovereign nation and are not above poisoning people with radioactive capsules.
So I dunno.
Even if all the fire fighters and all fire fighting infrastructure survived a nuclear blast, they would quickly be overwhelmed when literally the entire city is burning (Outside of maybe ground zero - but there wouldn't be much to save there anyway?
).
Visiting family, conducting business, or just normal tourism.
It's an interesting place and it's generally safe.
The main concern right now is becoming a pawn in a game of geopolitical chess, but that wasn't an issue until last year.
