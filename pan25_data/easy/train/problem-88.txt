Pretending to be Jewish and then exonerating Marjorie Taylor Greene from accusations of antisemitism using your fake Jewishness?
Fucking disgusting, seriously.

Then you have your Enabler Parents Republicans.
Good examples of those are Mitch McConnel, Mitt Romney, and others who know how to act like adults, and at least pretend to be cordial.
They are somewhat reasonable people by themselves, but they are Enabler Parents because they always vote in lock-step for whatever the dominant crazy ones want to do since Trump (occasionally before Trump maybe, but never as prominent before).
To be clear here, I'm only saying they act a certain way, they are just as evil, but prefer to appear professional and agreeable.
These types have been beaten into submission by the Toddlers post-Trump, and is not a good thing since no one with half a brain is at the controls anymore and just lets their 8 year old drive the car.
Interesting.
That might explain the recent uptick in crazy from Florida.
It really felt like Florida went from purple-ish with DeSantis barely edging out a victory a few years to full blown red lunacy across the board.
