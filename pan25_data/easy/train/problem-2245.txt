morality, like nations or race, is basically a meaningless social construct that changes based on the person, time, culture, language, etc.
"kidnapping is bad because it's bad" isn't persuasive; "this particular kidnapping is bad because it can't achieve anything other than suffering/because the kidnappers cause more suffering than they relieve" is persuasive, though, because it's a net increase in the suffering the world; it's something tangible with actual consequences, rather than a moral principle.
but in a case where it actually prevents more people from dying, it is absolutely a net positive.
you accept millions of innocents getting caught up in wars as a necessary evil; the only difference here, aside from a more righteous cause, is the fact it isn't done by the state and thus is deemed illegal which is, again, a social construct.
"Colonialist"?
I'm also pretty sure that many people int these places would be sad to lose tourist money.
I know that when we lost hours it's it wasA shit show.
