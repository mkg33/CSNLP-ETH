Santos Donated To The Queens County Republican Patriots, A Group Who Attacked The Queens County Republican Party From The Right And “Fraudulently Submitted Petitions To Get” Their Candidates On The 2021 Republican Primary Ballot.
Wow.
That sounded like a silly conspiracy theory, so I went looking for evidence to refute it, but there really isn't any.
It looks like the only positive evidence that he's a U.S. citizen is that he was described as such by a Brazilian court when he was on trial for forging checks.
The court was probably just taking his word for it, so that's not worth much at all.
Newsday Editorial: Santos “Has Little Familiarity With Specific Nassau And Suffolk Issues, Especially Local Environmental Concerns”.
Well said.
It’s scary being next door to this.
Watching the speaker fiasco, on top of the absolute bozos that were re-elected recently, the US is going down a scary road.
40% of voters just don’t care who they vote for unless there is an R next to the name.
The Republican Party is essentially made up of a few absolute wing nuts, the rest are just plain cowards and/or evil people.
