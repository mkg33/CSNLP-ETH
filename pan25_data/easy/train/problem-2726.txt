Picard is gonna wrangle with the slavery implications of a bloke that wants to take Data apart to mass produce him and Data's free will is debated as a machine that explicitly doesn't want to be disassembled........now here's an episode about Jordy falling in love with a hologram of a super famous engineer he was inspired by in college.......now the holodeck is fucked up and....I wanna say Al Capone has invaded the ship.....now the ship is getting overtaken because Riker banged some alien chick who got him to play literally the worst video game you've ever seen in all of TV or movies.....Beverly Crusher has a romance with a ghost.......Warf gets beat up (provably).
Sort of.
The wind is not always cooperative nor is shear guaranteed.
For example getting an unpowered balloon across the tropics would be a major challenge.
Not only that, it is a balloon.
If you were to try to bring it down into the troposphere where the most substantial wind and shear could exist, it could be subject to loss due to small scale weather events.
Like hail.
Itâ€™s astounding propaganda.
If we have replicators and infinite mass and energy and are post consumption why are we all encouraged to enroll in star fleet?
