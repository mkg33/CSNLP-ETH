All of Ukraine's international maritime shipping passes through Turkiye.
As does the maritime trade of Bulgaria, Romania, and Georgia.
If Turkiye wants to close off the straits to ships heading to and from those countries, they may, and under the international framework that is advanced by the EU, the G7 members, and various other "Western Bloc" nations, we're supposed to recognize that right.
The issue is that Erdogan is the dictator in control of a country that: A) Was already in NATO when he came to power, and B) still possesses control of the straits leading between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea.
That second part is rather important.
Unlike the areas of the South China Sea that the U.S. and other countries like to sail through periodically, the Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits aren't International Waters - they're Turkish, and so subject to Turkish law and policy.
EXACTLY.
I worked with sane, normal Turks for two years and they all DESPISED Erdoğan.
Turkey is a weird country: the west and Thrace are European in both culture and mentality, but the farther east you go, the more conservative it gets.
He also gets the vote of Turks who’ve lived in Germany for three generations….
