And they shouldn’t.
Brazil has its own problems and is geographically remote.
Urban violence makes a lot of major-city neighborhoods almost as dangerous as war-torn areas, public services (e.g.
sanitarion) are lacking in most of the country, education is miles away from any developed country (worse than the US), government has no money (and needs to amp up spending for political reasons).
Ukraine war only impacts trade and inflation, but inflation in Brazil is the norm, not the exception.
Brazil does not care about Ukraine or geopolitics for the same reason it doesn’t care about the Amazon forest - you neglect long-term issues when you have too many short-term issues.
Yes.
More importantly is the fact that Brazil's overall import to export ratio is 5 to 1, and the most important pf those imports are refined petroleum products and motor vehicles.
The US is the largest refined petroleum exporter in the world, and one of the largest motor vehicle exporters as well.
A couple tariffs or sanctions and suddenly Brazils economy is feeling intense pain.
