Whereas some state prisons (for example: grappling with a massive inmate population) only run around 50% of time sentenced!
Good behavior, participation in activities and therapies, and becoming a trustee in a work role can drop that down to just 40% of time sentenced.
These are Violent crimes.
Non-violent drug crimes are typically just 25% of time sentenced (per the JRA).
Exactly.
Tons of militias that pretend they are innocently larping an insurrection.
Suddenly some idiots, (and these groups never seems to run out of them) take their “fantasies” too far, and everyone is now in jail.

In my experience, historically low-income and rural areas do have higher likelihoods of regional pollution due to a number of factors: NIMBY types (upper middle class people aren't going to stand for a power plant right next to their housing development), deliberately locating facilities in areas with cheaper costs of living/lower acceptable wages, and simply not giving a shit about poor people and minorities.
