Everyone gangster until the deep state shows up, then everything 'mysteriously' falls apart.
They seem hell bent on preserving democracy, no matter the cost.
Look at Jan 6th for example.
Well-ish organized, tons of weapons, everyone rallied to a singular cause, ect... but as soon as it enters the capitol, everything falls apart.
Comms break down, no one has any idea where the targets are located, ect.. Lots of this is due to 'crowd mentality' but for how organized everything was prior to this, it seems like everyone in that crowd, and those organizing everything, shit the bed.
Again, not surprising, but for something so critical to their goals...maybe a bit odd.
My guess is, those tolerating Drumpf's shit finally had enough, and decided to feed him to the sharks.
Look at what's happened since, for instance.
Endless picking apart of his actions on Jan 6th, constant pressure from federal legal authorities, abandonment and failure to secure votes from his own party, ect.... Drumpf made a serious try for American Democracy, and those that tolerated his antics up to that point have since decided he's more of a liability than anything else.
I love to see it.
They spend several years rubber stamping everything he wants, kissing his ass, and turning their heads to every shitty thing he did while in office.
Now they want to say they don’t like him anymore?
Get fucked.
We won’t forget.
