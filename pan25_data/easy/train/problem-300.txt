Read what I said carefully, I never claimed there would be a Shia version of ISIS, I said there would be a power vacuum for organizations similar to them, there are also Sunni's in Iran and Saudi Arabia being a big sponsor would sponsor there also.
Doing what you said will leave a power vacuum in Iran which will be filled in by many organizations and I'll bet there will be organizations similar to ISIS also.
Side note, ISIS share similar ideologies to one nation that is an US "ally".
Saudi Arabia who funded and was the cause of many terrorist organizations.
Retaliate?
So they will sponsor even more terrorism and wars, just like they sponsor war in Yemen, ISIS, PLA, Hamas?
No way...
Again you and people that spew the same rhetoric as you didn't learn anything because I was referring to the power vacuum left by the US after it's invasion of Iraq which led to the formation of ISIS which is not a SHIA organization meaning that It's not an organization funded by the biggest Shia nation out there Iran.
