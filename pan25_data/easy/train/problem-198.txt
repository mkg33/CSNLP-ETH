Well I don't think they really clarify what "near" is.
People dive in harbors all the time.
It's dumb.
But off the top of my head I'd say oyster diving, or just looking for shit people lost.
Like people make YouTube vids about diving under bridges and shit.
So depending on the size of the area qnd how close they actually were to any of said infrastructure is pretty explainable.
I don't recognize that scooter without doing research but the ones I use can cover a couple miles.
But most static (not drift dives in strong current, start and end in the same place) dives I do don't cover that much ground.
A soccer field would be a massive dive.
And only one of them had a Spanish passport and none of them provided correct contact informationâ€¦ just your average, middle of winter, nighttime, Spanish amber hunters operating in Polish waters without any documents or contact information.
Nothing to see here.
Incompetent/corrupt police.
There was no major reform of the police in Poland, lately they're just protecting corrupted government, they're poorly trained, wages are not attractive.
Even if there's some young policemen that would want to change it, their ideas are blocked by older policemen.
