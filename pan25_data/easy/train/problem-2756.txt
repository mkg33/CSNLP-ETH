- This may shut down Title X funded providers and clinics until the decision is appealed and/or the providers/clinics put systems in place to obtain and verify parental consent for minors.
Federal law requires Title X programs to provide for adolescents, so they can’t just say “oh we don’t service teens right now”- the entire program would have to shutter to a halt as they develop the proper systems and protocols to abide by this judge’s orders.

Double down!
Plug their ears, scream louder, submerge themselves in comforting conspiracies, isolate themselves from the masses, etc.

It’s not that they aren’t capable of understanding, it’s that they don’t want to understand.
You ever hear that bit of advice which says you shouldn’t wake a sleepwalker because they may panic and hurt either you or themselves?
Same thing.
