Wow.
I guess we can smoke weed now in the Capitol chambers?
How very liberal of the republicans.
We’ve wanted that all along!
Exactly.
They go about trying to defund things and crying about democrats and election issues but everything is the Republicans causing issues and issues with them but blame the Democrats.
The democrats have their own problems and what MTG and her loser squad complaining is nothing but her looking in the mirror.
I’m a professionally licensed natural gas, building steam, refrigeration, and large commercial industrial ventilation technician.
Every building of this nature(especially critical government ) has common duct work leading back to an air handler main unit for the building.
This will suck all this “private office” smoke right in the the main system where it’s redistributed to all the other supply venting areas.
So basically smoke everywhere.
I know this because I constantly have to fix the part of the machines where it brings in FRESH AIR.
This keeps acute building sickness related issues away as fresh air is always being mixed into buildings even dead ass in middle of winter.
They will need to have special smoke detectors to detect a much more dense level of smoke before shutting down.
This is fucking stupid.
