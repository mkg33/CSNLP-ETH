When I got it recently for the second time this year, I felt terrible about not knowing I was sick.
It was open windows weather so I assumed my itchy throat (which is a new symptom I later learned) was related to sleeping with the windows open.
I went to work on day four of my slightly itchy throat and suddenly felt “off”.
That’s when it dawned on me that the throat could actually be Covid.
I got some congestion that night, which incidentally coincided with the rain.
My daughter had had a headache and the urgent care lady told us it was allergies.
I decided to test at home and it was Covid.
None of us had a fever or body aches but my daughter did have a lasting headache.
The “feeling off” keeps standing out to me and I wonder if I’ll have that fuzzy brain feeling the next time I get it, maybe it will be a signal that it’s actually Covid.
Hopefully my brain isn’t getting permanent damage.
Interesting.
My cousin had exact same symptoms but tested negative for COVID and A & B.
Turns out it was RSV.
Fever of 101.5°F (38.6°C) for 5 days straight.
