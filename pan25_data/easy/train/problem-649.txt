We all see politicians are too old and often too moderate.
But you want Gen Z treated like a powerful voting block when they've consistently refuse to become one.
Once Gen Z starts voting politicians will start pandering to them.
Until then it's seen as a waste of time, and that's not entirely the fault of politicians but rather people who defend, support, or participate in Gen Z voter apathy and then get pissy that nobody looks out for their interests, when they haven't bothered to vote in people who would do that or at least move things in that direction.
"F" Texas.
They knew their grid sucked, this has happened to them several times before.
But they keep electing asshole governors, senators and representatives who spend their time and money demonizing minorities and immigrants and sending refugees by bus to DC.
Texas sucks, let them figure it out themselves.
It's the bigoted conservative way no?
As they like to say, "take personal responsibility" or maybe just pray to your god that teaches you to hate others.
