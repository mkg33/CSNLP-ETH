To an observer with no dog in this fight, one side is trying to get to the bottom of what seems like a very nearly successful attempt to overturn democracy.
The other side is desperately trying to promote a false narrative of equivalency and launching ever more strident, ever more illusory investigations as distractions and for politically rather than genuinely ethically driven reasons.
The documents were at his house and office.
It doesn’t matter if they were found in November or last March.
They would have been turned in when they were found.
There would have been an investigation.
The existence of investigation would eventually have become public.
That gets us to where we are now.
Now the Democrats want an investigation of the investigation that was an investigation of another investigation.
Can we just stop investigating anything that doesn’t go exactly how we want it to go?
Tit for tat has become the American way.
