I'll take the contrarian opinion here.
Chinese spyware sharing with the Chinese government doesn't worry me in the slightest because I'm never going to go there.
Google, Facebook, Amazon and even Spotify have some rather scary data harvesting practices of their own.
I had a conversation in a bar a few weeks back and we were talking about corporate turnover.
I was getting ads for a week for job agencies, starting on my drive home.
Had a conversation at work about a coworkers vacation, and wouldn't you know I had recommendations for top 40 hits of Mexico the next time I turned on both YouTube and Spotify.
Your phone is always listening, and I'm damn sure they're sharing my data with whomever pays the 10 cents that it's worth, including the Chinese government.
Tiktok is just doing it for them for free.
Exactly.
Tiktok is kinda sneaky with getting you to grant access but if you are aware of it and turn it off I don’t know what the big issue is.
13 year old kids are a different story.
I wouldn’t expect them to know how and what to switch off.
