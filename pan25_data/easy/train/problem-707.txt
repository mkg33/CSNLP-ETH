But what about immunity for any action taken that might have endangered their Congressional duties?
I remember at least one person tweeting out the movement of potentially targeted individuals in the legislature while being aware that the Capitol building was being breached (from her personal Twinner account; not one meant for Congressional business).
Yeah I think so too.
With how the GOP has been playing.
2024 NEw World Order here we come Seeing how the govt around the world have been falling, US is only matter of time.

They also want to bring back slavery I'm sure.
Funny how justice works swiftly when a poor person commits a misdemeanor, but when a rich person commits multiple crimes against the nation and our institutions (not to mention the numerous financial crimes) it just creeps along slowly until the culprit either dies rich and comfortably of natural causes or, even worse, people just to decide to move on in the name of "unity" and "healing".
Holding my breath.
We are taught to be accountable for our actions.
What are we showing our kidsâ€¦ this growing generation if we do not hold people accountable for trying to overthrow our democracy holding a failed coup.
