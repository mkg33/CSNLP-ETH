As if this hasn't been abundantly and publicly clear by FBI Director Comey's interference on Trump's behalf in the 2016 election, Mueller's slow-walking and obfuscation during the Trump investigation, and the abject failure of the FBI and DOJ to move against a single co-conspirator in Trump's executive Branch or among Republican Congressmen - even when they publicly incited a mob to attack Congress and hang the Vice President on national fucking TV.
Idk.
Remember Rod Blagojevich?
The governor of Illinois who was sentenced to prison for fraud and trying to sell President Obama's senate seat?
It wouldn't be the first time "favors" were traded for political power.
Oh and by the way guess who got their sentence commuted by Trump?
Good old Rod.
There's enough of a whiff of truth here to convince me something did go down.
