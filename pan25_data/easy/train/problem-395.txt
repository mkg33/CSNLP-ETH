I am a dad now and I don’t trust anyone.
When I was a Boy Scout I remember learning about “two deep leadership” where under no circumstances is a boy to be alone with an adult.
Ever.
Always multiple adults or multiple scouts.
Preferably multiple adults.
Heck, when I became a leader myself and a younger brother was still a scout we shared a tent - he is my brother remember - and it was a big deal.
Everyone had to be made aware, on board, etc.
True, as it is in Mormonism and Evangelicalism… it so much in non-denominational missionary alliance churches etc.
Not that they really seem to care.
Being allowed to fuck kids seems to be at the top of the agenda at this point.
No real leadership would allow this to go on and cover it up otherwise.
