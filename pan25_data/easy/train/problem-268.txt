I've worked in schools where like 90% of students would qualify for free lunch program.
But in my state, if 40% of students qualify for free lunch they are designated for grant funds under a special provision and the school provides what are called Title 1 policies to all students at the school.
So everyone gets free lunch, and some also do food bag programs.
The food bag programs are interesting because all the kids are required to take it home regardless of need.
The parents can bring it back if they don't need it.
But the idea is that the funds were allocated for every single kid and so every family is entitled to that food.
Coloradan here.
I don’t think it’s much to ask for everyone to pay an extra little bit in taxes for every child to be guaranteed literally just 5 meals per week for most of the year.
If we can’t feed our kids then what are we even doing as a nation.
Furthermore this allows the parents to use that money on just as important of stuff like feeding themselves or keeping a good house or car.
This helps people from going homeless.
