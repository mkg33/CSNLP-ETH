And I think that's entirely backwards, because not every power structure acts the same way and the values of a faith will inform its actions.
I truly cannot understand people who say that Christianity has almost never upheld Christian values (except for Christian primitivists, because nothing is more Christian than accusing other Christians of being insufficiently Christian), because cultural control, domination, and colonialism are Christian values.
The Roman Empire was fine with allowing its subjects to retain their own gods, until Christianity arrived and they began forcible evangelization.
The Western Roman Empire collapsed when its attempts to maintain Nicene control over the largely Arian Germanic tribes backfired horribly, but that didn't stop the death march of evangelization from continuing until it had ravaged every indigenous European faith.
And so it went.
If we're talking about colonialism, the inquisition, or jihad that's an entirely different matter.
That's far different than "hey have you heard about this God fellow?
".
Before I get attacked: There is a difference if a) the whole country is in favor of military aid from an outside agressor (like Ukraine) or b) very short time relieve efforts after a natural disaster (one time food aid after a major crop failure, can't price out local farmers that don't have anything to sell anyways).
In those cases foreign aid can be good.
