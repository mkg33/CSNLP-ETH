This particular thing that this article about is especially ludicrous, especially since people like Tucker Carlson and MTG are calling for a federal investigation.
The big thing they're all upset about is that the day after the insurrection, back on January 7th 2021, a German Twitter account asked if America's elections were being run by foreign entities, and Katie Hobbs (as the secretary of state for Arizona) noted to a nonprofit that they should be flagged or removed as election misinformation.
They're claiming that something Katie Hobbs did in her role as AZ's SOS nearly two years ago while Trump was president warrants a federal investigation into a governor's race that just happened.
It's truly bizarre.
You would think after 3 consecutive general elections where they have lost and lost and lost again (2018 house, 2020 senate/presidency/Arizona -2 senators/Georgia -2 senators), and then barely eeked out a mid-term win, but lost State Legislatures, Governorships, AG's, & Senators etc.
in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania & Georgia.
