We'll see how it plays out, my understanding was that with the adjusted way bargaining works, 'minor' players like RAFFWU or other grass-root organised groups have less of a say in the bargaining table / consideration given to their claims than the larger, more recognised shoppers (who can eat a dick as far as I'm concerned).
why not both?
Shitty gov't is usually a product of apathetic or moronic voters.
A symptom and not a root cause.
Better-educated populace (basic education) would lead to better candidates to vote for.
It's EA's as well.
Negotiations have either stalled or just aren't being started by a lot of employers at this point - was one of the reasons the recent IR bill that passed had so much hubbub about multi-employer (sector wide) bargaining.
Well done.
I don't care who you vote for, but we desperately need more voters like you.
You don't have to vote for a major party because you think you're vote will be wasted.
Think of it as building the seats up of your chosen minor for the future.
It may not happen now, but if enough people desert the majors, things will change, major parties can become minor ones.
