The negative effects on society caused by drug prohibition are far more profound than the use of drugs would be itself if they were legalized.
We need to legalize and regulate all illicit substances.
Instead of the ineffective policy of locking people up and ruining their lives for drug use, we should offer drug rehabilitation.
It would save taxpayers' money, save lives, and destroy the illicit drug trade.
I'm serious.
Every single drug should be legalized, distributed in government controlled dispensaries that verify potency and preclude contamination, and the money diverted from feckless law enforcement and prisons should go to drug education and treatment programs.
But is it the right ones?
Because you don't solve alcoholism for example by saying "oh you are now allowed to drink insertthinghere" (for example drunk driving or drinking in public open places like a street).
You try to get them help to reduce the usage and possibly get them off it entirely by offering support, be it via support groups, rehab facilities or something else.
