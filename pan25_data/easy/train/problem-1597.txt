The Groningen/Slochteren field was discovered during the tail of of the post-war reconstruction era.
During the following 60-year period, the Dutch Government earned approximately €420 billion in revenues derived from the field’s exploitation.
A good chunk of that money was used to rebuild the country’s infrastructure, but also to pay for the rapidly expanding welfare state.
A welfare state that was based on a post-was consensus between all major parties, including PvdA/Labour, various Christian democratic parties and the liberal VVD.
And this continued right into the present day.
We only decided to stop extracting the natural gas because our government is plainly incompetent in dealing with earthquake damage caused by the extraction proces.
Otherwise the vast majority of our political establishment would love to spend the billions of extra tax revenues on all sorts of questionable things.
No.
We have not used the fund to reduce taxes.
That is what Thatcher did in the UK with their oil and gas revenue, to no permanent gain.
