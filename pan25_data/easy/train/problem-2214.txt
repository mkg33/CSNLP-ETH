irrelevant for the argument.
If they want to win, going nuclear is not an option.
If they want to survive, going nuclear is not an option.
If they don't care about either, then going nuclear is useless as well.
Either way, Russia has nothing to gain from using nukes.
Why even is it that Russia who has nukes can make these threats, but the US who also has nukes somehow can't make them?
I think there's something seriously wrong with how the world is organized.
Letting a hostile nation do whatever they want just because they have the same weapons as you does not have any positive outcome in any possible reality.
All you're doing is telling Russia that it's perfectly fine to hit nato troops and they don't have to fear retaliation, so they are just gonna send all their troops into Europe.
I mean, you're not gonna defend, right?
You don't want the war to go nuclear, right?
I mean actual Russian territory, not "Russian territory".
Because if you are nuclear power and you allow someone to invade you without consequences, then you may as well have no nukes.
And then you will be picked apart by neighbours, since your army is too weak to do anything.
