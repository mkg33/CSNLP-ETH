I'd expect the USA to by and large be well ahead of China with most technologies.
It wouldn't be a shock (to me) if China had comparable and perhaps better hyper missiles.
From my understanding, China is all in on hypersonic missiles because those are seen as the best deterrent to our air craft carriers.
The military doesn't release detailed response plans, but I remember reading a military expert and he was saying that if a war broke out between the US and China, he'd expect the air craft carriers to quickly retreat away from China to reduce risks associated with hyper missiles.

We should just shoot the fucking thing down.

Yeah definitely.
On top of that, we've been spending a lot more on defense over the course of decades.
This has allowed the USA to accumulate a vast amount of weapons, technologies, and know-how.
