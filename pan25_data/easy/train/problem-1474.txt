I think that was made clear when he tried to take the ball and go home with the Jan 6 committee.
Imagine the absolute shitshow that committee would have been if McCarthy had chosen literally members that wew not part of the insurrection to sit in it and run interference.
The committee would have nothing to show for after two years.

Responsible and accountable for allowing the previous administration to overthrow the election and stop the peaceful transfer of power.
Thats whats so weird to me.
Hes sold EVERYTHING to become speaker - sucking up to Trump.post Jan 6th after like 2 days of blaming Trump, concessions like these, making MTG his travel buddy.

Not necessarily.
Back when the GOP had a backbone, Kevin was widely rumored to have had an affair with fellow representative Renee Ellmers, and so he backed out of the leadership race as news of the affair broke.
