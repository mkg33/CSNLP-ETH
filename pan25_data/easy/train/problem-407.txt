Winner/Loser of the popular vote is a meaningless statistic that has never been the criteria to selecting a President.
Every Justice on the SC has been appointed by a President who won the Electoral College, meaning the SC is democratic.

You can have an upper class while still acknowledging that having a billion dollars is obscene.

This obstruction strategy eventually politicized the Supreme Court.
The GOP removed longstanding Congressional precedents to pack the court in their favor because it's easier to let a judge rule on an issue than it is to run on one.
The court is now purposefully packed so conservative judges will rule on issues that would otherwise make Republican candidates or representatives unpopular.

One of the several issues being looked at by the Supreme Court for this case is if Biden's student loan forgiveness is legal via the HEROES Act route and if it meets the bill's requirements.
Congress specifically passed a bill authorizing PPP loans and their forgiveness.
Biden is attempting to do his forgiveness through a different route (not a bill passed by Congress specifically), so there will have to be a ruling before it could go through.
