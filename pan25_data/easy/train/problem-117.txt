I had a very similar experience with one of my closest friends and his family growing up.
They are hard core country people and my family is Muslim but our families were both new to Houston.
Over the years our families had celebrated numerous holidays together.
He even lived with us for a couple months (tragic family accident).
Some members of his family would definitely be called racist by modern standards but only because they had no exposure.
People forget how Muslims were depicted post 911.
Exposure really changes a lot.
Theyâ€˜ve moved back to the country but they have always despised Trump and are probably some of three only democrats in their town.
Gaaah "socialism"?
How brainwashedly stupid this is.
Even most of the democrats are to the right of most mainstream right parties in EU.
How little about the outside world is it possible to know for anyone living in a developed country?
Very little, obviously.
Herschel walker has lived in Dallas for many years.
He has a homestead exemption on his Dallas area mansion.
No one even brought it up in the Georgia race!
