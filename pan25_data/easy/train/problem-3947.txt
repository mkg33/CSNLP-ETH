If they mention that Ukraine must give up its territory to Russia, then Kiev should simply counter with another UN resolution declaring Taiwan's independence on the same grounds that China invokes with respect to Ukraine.
They may potentially support Ukraine's territory unity, since any move to cede Ukraine land to Russia would directly contradict their ideas on territorial integrity with respect to Taiwan.
True.
It's my impression that they could sustain themselves reasonably well without imports, but things like meat and citrus would become rare and expensive, so it would be a notable decline in quality of life for many people, but not an immediate starvation issue.
They don’t care.
They’ll say whatever suits them best in any moment.
That goes for their supposed “neutrality” here as well.
They view diplomacy as a cynical game of realpolitik and nothing more.
If they wanna show up and pretend to “negotiate peace” at the 11th hour after tacitly propping up Russia this entire time, most international observers aren’t gonna think it’s anything more than a ploy.
