In this article, she specifically mentions early childhood memories she should have of her mum and her stepdad and her dad.
It'd be a bit odd not to mention if she'd been adopted at the same time.
Technically 'white' people encompass europeans, turks, egyptians, arabs, and IIRC north indians.
The race doesn't switch until somewhere in the middle of india (some kashimiris are 'white' or 'caucasian' or whatever our race is).
Exactly.
That's why they aren't offering.
They know it's not her and could've ended it two years ago.
But that won't get views.
If they thought it was her for real they would've DNA tested her right away to break the story because it would've been huge and they'd be the first to report it.
Of course she might be in on it but to be it looks like she's getting used by multiple people.
Not necessarily.
You could compare her DNA to that of her family.
(By which I mean, the family of the girl making this claim).
More likely than not thatâ€™ll show she is related to them, thus negating the need for further tests.
