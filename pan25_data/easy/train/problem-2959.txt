"The XBB.1.5 omicron subvariant that’s currently dominating the U.S. is the most contagious version of Covid-19 yet, but it doesn’t appear to make people sicker, according to the World Health Organization.

Well I think the other fear is that it will overwhelm our healthcare system again, which then indirectly causes all sorts of people to die from all sorts of fatal reasons (head trauma, deep wounds, heart attack, driving accidents etc) because the beds and immediate attention those people would normally get are now taken by COVID patients.
So it may not seem like the symptoms are any worse than catching any previous variant, but if hospitalization rates rise because of how much faster it spreads it will cause significant deaths both directly and indirectly.
Yeah.
I'd be pissed if our tax funded hospital was keeping secrets from us.
They stopped sharing overall population infection numbers a long time ago in most areas I think since so many people hardly bother to test anymore so the numbers would be completely inaccurate.
But hospital numbers are public knowledge everywhere up here as far as I know.
