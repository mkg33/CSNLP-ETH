Honestly I think you're going to see Biden's approvals go way up between now and 2024, especially with the CPI report this week indicating that inflation seems to be starting to go down.
Odds are that will be way in the rearview mirror by 2024, and meanwhile everything else is looking good for the Dems.
The economy remains strong despite the inflation numbers, Russia appears on the run with NATO strong as ever.
The withdrawal from Afghanistan won't be a bigger issue in 2024 than it was in 2022.
Additionally, we'll be over two years into all that infrastructure money being spent to upgrade all corners of the country, computer chip manufacturing in America should be up and running by then, prescription drug prices will be down, and progress should be made on renewable energy due to the Inflation Reduction Act (which takes effect in January).
Not to mention that Biden already got a Black woman on the Supreme Court and did what he could to reduce student debt.
Committed to troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, appointed theocratic conservative Catholic majority to SCOTUS, accidentally increased funding to Obamacare.
