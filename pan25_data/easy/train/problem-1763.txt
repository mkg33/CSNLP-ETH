While there were certainly some converts from the GOP rank and file, most of the true believer MAGA's came from the far right fringe.
The GOP typically treated the far right fringe the same way the democrats treat young voters.
"Yeah, we'd like your support, but we don't actually expect you to show up, so who gives a fuck?

They are voting for Hakeem Jeffries, they aren't going to vote for a Republican just like the Republicans won't vote for a Democrat, this is the dysfunction in the Republican party on display for everyone, he needs 218 Republicans to vote for him, he only has 222, 19 have now defected after the last vote I saw.
The Democrats are just laughing.
