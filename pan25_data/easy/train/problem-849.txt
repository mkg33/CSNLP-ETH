Common Good Constitutionalism doesn't do this to anywhere the same degree from what I've seen (might see if library has this book though) written in this article.
The tools and ideas of Common Good Constitutionalism can be used as a weapon against their desires way more than Originalism could imo.
I definitely do not love the idea of "common good constitutionalism"; however, on reading it there is one issue for conservatives I could see from it.
One of the foundationally useful tools of Originalism for them is that it is difficult for Liberal/Progressives to co-opt.
Sure, Gorsuch in their view misused it but by and large it sits diametrically opposed to progression.
Exactly.
The entire theory is based on the assumption that a theologically based morality is the "only" morality that exists, and is therefore the basis of the common good that governments should be following.
When you recognize that the basis of the theory is all a fairy tale, it completely falls apart.
You could actually use this "common good" theory to argue for policies that lean way left.
