It's not a diagnosis, it's a good guess based on the fact that Brinton has stolen suitcases at least twice, with no evidence that has been made public that they've sought to profit from this theft, or that they have a gambling or addiction problem they're trying to pay for, and has no real reason to do so since they're well-employed.
Plus the thefts are the sort that can be done spur of the moment, as is always the case with kleptomania, since it's a compulsion, not something that is premeditated or planned.
So, kleptomania seems pretty likely here, unlike the case of someone stealing catalytic converters, since you're going to have to pack some tools, carefully scout an area, and be at least somewhat stealthy about it.
Stealing catalytic converters takes planning, which is not a feature of compulsive thefts.
Walking off with someone else's luggage does not require premeditation.
