Hiking with a handgun is just easier than carrying a rifle over your shoulder, less weight and less awkward.
Handguns aren't an ideal choice for defense against bears compared to a long gun, but many handguns are specifically designed for such a purpose, such as large frame revolvers in calibers like .44 Reminon Magnum, .454 Casull, .460 Smith & Wesson Magnum, .480 Ruger, and .500 Smith & Wesson Magnum, as well as revolvers like the Magnum Research BFR that is chambered in rifle cartridges like 45-70.
Some people will use a semiautomatic handgun like a Glock 20 in 10mm for bears, provided you use 10mm ammo that is loaded hot and not the more benign "FBI loads".
Pretty ahistorical imo.
30% were ballsdeep in QMAGANON conspiracies and railing against globalist jew pedophile cabals.
Another 30% had been railing against capitalism since either 2009 or 2015, only to have their political ambitions extinguished by the old guard in 2020.
The George Floyd aftermath sent ripples across both of those groups temporarily but didn't fundamentally alter anything.
The anticapitalists didn't go anywhere and neither did the loonies.
The former just didn't have and still doesn't have the grassroots organizing and organic networks to keep the pressure on.
It was all on the back of a presidential candidate and mostly just online discourse fueled by hope.
