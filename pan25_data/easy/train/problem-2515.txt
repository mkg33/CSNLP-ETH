Openly refuse Weed legalization at the federal level.
Though Bidenâ€™s executive actions are incredibly welcomed.
Its still not even vocal support for legalization.
Any decriminalization bill would still allow states like Texas to facilitate the death of Black americans for petty weed possession like the case of Marvin Scott III.
Nah.
Are the the democrats doing enough?
No.
Do they implement incremental improvements that benefit us?
Yes.
Compared to the Republicans to seek to strip away our social safety nets and feed us bodily to corporations while disenfranchising us with the ultimate goal of seeing us dead or imprisoned, they're pretty fucking alright.
I have zero sympathy for those who don't vote because the democrats aren't "good enough."
Fuck you, apathy is siding with the enemy.
