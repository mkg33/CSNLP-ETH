One important thing to know is that the Holodomor wasn't so much an ideological issue, as it was an ethnic issue.
This was just the last attempt by Russia to ethnically cleanse part of Ukraine to resettle it with Russians, and the way the USSR did it this time was by deliberately starving Ukraine.
The communist party in Ukraine opposed to these decisions, because they knew what Russia was doing and they knew Ukraine would starve if they complied with Soviet requests to seize crops and deliver them to Russia.
This was the perfect excuse for Stalin and the Russian-led CPSU to purge Ukrainian nationalists out of the Ukrainian soviet systems, and replace them with pro-Russian politicians.
Jesus man, calm down a bit.
I am not saying it makes it better or worse.
I am just stating that the pope has no special love for Russia but has a hatred for NATO.
It is useful perspective in understanding why he says what he says.
Questioning legitimacy of NATO, encouraging opposition of weapons supports to Ukrainians, blames Ukrainians leadership.
Which side only did those kind of statements beneficiated?
russia.
