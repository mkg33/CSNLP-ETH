My guess is that the deck would be staked against the victim and rarely would be they be granted an abortion especially in a small rural county.. Would the victim be treated with respect while being questioned?
My guess is that unlike a court room as this isn't a court hearing per say, the panel could ask the victim any question they wish, so the victim's sex life, sexual history, relationship with men, medical history, family life would be the main focus.
The sexual assault would be secondary.
They would be treated like women were in the 1950's when they were sexual assault victims.

Staggering misogyny.
They would never suggest ignoring the right of a man to control his own body.
