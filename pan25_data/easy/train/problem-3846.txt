Communism is not a small threat.
It has killed millions almost every it has been tried.
I can list the notorious examples if you really need me to.
I don't know why you put Communism in quotes, it's a real political system that has killed millions.
No, Russia is not Communist.
Yes, China is.
And yes, we should still support Ukraine against Russian aggression even though Russia is not Communist.
And yes, we should support Taiwan against Chinese aggression whether or not China is Communist (they are, but its not the only reason to support free-Taiwan).
And yes, we should vigorously resist Communism from gaining hold in the free world, not only is it a bad idea that never works, it almost always leads to the deaths of millions every time and place it is attempted.

Is colonization an outcome of Capitalism or Imperialism?
Anyways, what about people who've died fighting communists, such as in the Russian Revolution, Chinese Revolution, Korean war, Vietnam war, and various countries in Latin America?
