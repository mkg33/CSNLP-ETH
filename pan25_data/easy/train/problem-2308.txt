The College Board claimed that it repeatedly pushed the state Department of Education to detail specific feedback and concerns with the course, to no avail.
“We have made the mistake of treating FDOE with the courtesy we always accord to an education agency, but they have instead exploited this courtesy for their political agenda,” the group wrote.
“After each written or verbal exchange with them, as a matter of professional protocol, we politely thanked them for their feedback and contributions, although they had given none.”.
The modern "conservatives"...aren't.
They don't want to conserve anything.
They want to regress to a time that never existed and remake the country into a Christian, nationalist nation.
They're fine with big government as long as its in service of their culture war issues.
No problems with big brother snooping in our bedrooms as long as its set against LGBT families.
Government telling schools what to teach?
Sure, as long as you don't teach Timmy that some folks don't believe in Jesus or that some families have 2 dads or moms.
