It comes down to R0.
Infection-prevention measures against COVID were effective at driving its R0 down from 3 to 1.1-1.3, but it still spread because SARS-CoV-2 is crazy infectious.
Delta had an R0 of 4+, and Omicron is 6+.
But flu is always an R0 of around 1-2.
Outbreaks and epidemics can be halted with R0s that low and proper implementation of infection-prevention techniques.
Right?
I’ll find one of those Telehealth companies and do that but I’m done with bedside pandemic shit.
I’m sorry to hear about the long COVID.
Somehow, my husband, my son, and I have avoided getting COVID while both of our families did.
My mom and stepdad, dad and stepmom, brother, grandparents, both nephews all got it.
My husband’s two daughters from a previous marriage, his mom and stepdad both brothers and a sister in law, two nieces, his dad ended up on ECMO and died and his stepmom.
Shit was wild.
