As an Ohioan, your caricature of what Republican lawmakers who were on the election map committee did concerning what the majority of Ohio voters wanted, the drawing up of a fair map, is spot on.
Also, knowing that abortion rights, and the creation of a election map committee that consists of an equal amount of Dems, independents, and Republicans were going to be put on a future ballot, the Secretary of State wanted to raise the percentage that a ballot initiative would pass to 60%.
These people are working tirelessly to erase the will of the majority of Ohioans.
It’s an outrage, and I don’t know why they’re allowed to get away with it.

Gerrymandering only affects state and federal representatives.
Although an argument can be made that people who live in gerrymandered districts tend not to vote at all because they think it's pointless so then they don't end up voting for the state level stuff either.
