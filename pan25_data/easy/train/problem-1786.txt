Look at you go trying to move the goalposts.
First you try and claim these are random people who don’t know anything about what they’re talking about, because you didn’t even bother to read the article.
Then, when you find out we’re talking about soldiers who are actually participating in the war, all of a sudden you think they do know what they’re talking about but that we should hear pro-Russian perspectives, as if the NY Times hasn’t also been reporting on pro-Russian perspectives for years as well.
You have no coherent point to make.
Because investigative journalism has a long tradition of using confidential informants.
Again, is this not obvious to you?
What’s with all the articles about various people, agencies, private entities “accidentally” leaking information?
Are we really to believe they’re oops!
moments?
The Kim family still controls North Korea, the Communist Party still controls Vietnam, the Ayatollah still controls Iran, Fidel Castro controlled Cuba until he retired in his 80s, and Nicolas Maduro still controls Venezuela.
Doesn’t look like much of a win rate to me.
