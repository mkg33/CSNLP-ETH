Edit: BTW, anything could still happen, and there could be a major incident with any nuclear plant that exists, regardless of when it was built.
No matter how good we think our failsafes are, something bad could probably still happen.
But you asked if nuclear is safer now than in the Fukushima days.
With the understanding that Fukushima days were back in 1967, when the plant was built (not when the accident happened), I have to imagine that the answer is probably "yes".
Unless the entire plant was retrofitted later, the technology used in Fukushima was from 1967.
Not from 2011.
2011 is just when the accident happened.
My limited understanding is that nuclear plants built more recently are safer than the Fukushima plant.
However, I admit this could be a misunderstanding on my part.
Someone more educated in the subject could possibly confirm my statement, or point out that I'm wrong and provide some details.
Nuclear.
We have the technology, itâ€™s safer than Chernobyl days, and relatively clean.
The only real issue is where to store the waste.
