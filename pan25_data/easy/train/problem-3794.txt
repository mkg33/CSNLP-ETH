All this “war crime” shit is a joke, you think that in combat someone cares if they are fighting fair?
Ha!
All war is criminal, the west might make attempts to minimize civilian casualties but even we fucked up sometimes, it’s war, you take anything you can get.
The difference is Russia has been hitting hospitals as TARGETS in Syria and every other proxy and actual war since 1995 it has been used as a strategy for YEARS.
Imagine keeping a Hippocratic oath when they wheel the dude (putin), a guy who supports actively bombing hospitals and blew up an apartment building to gain his presidency, into your hospital.
Then, you are asked “Doctor ______, please help him?”.
Then there's a very real chance that Russia has a popular uprising where people are demanding a better government more concerned with the welfare of the people, the west is going to be demanding Russia become a true democracy, and/or give up nuclear weapons, as a condition for lifting sanctions, and Ukraine is going to be demanding money that Russia doesn't have for reparations.
