As someone who grew up Catholic and went to Catholic schools, looking back it is painfully obvious now that compared to Islam, Judaism, and some protestant sects, Catholicism is certainly polytheistic.
Although Catholics would definitely claim that they do not worship Marry, particular saints, or Jesus separately from God, in practice they certainly do pray to and worship these multiple deities as their own entities who themselves posess godly powers.
If you visit a Hindu temple and observe how Hindus have niches to worship and provide offerings to specific Hindu gods, you'll see the parallels to the niches for Mary in candle lighting ceremonies that take place in most Catholic churches.
Observe how Hindus choose to align with particular gods such as Vishnu or Shiva, and adorn their vehicles and private sanctuaries with their preferred deities image.
This is (to an outsider) no different than how south Americans align with the worship of the goddess Mary by praying to candles bearing her likeness and decorating things of value with her image.
In contrast, in old Europe it was popular to do the same with the Jesus child.
Although a Catholic would state that they do not actually worship these idols, to an outside observer their practices are look same as those of a Hindu praying and offering to multiple gods.
As a child, I prayed to the saints, Mary and Jesus as distinct entities in the same way I'd pray to god.
In practice for many Catholics their prayers to saints, Mary, Jesus and the Holy spirit as distinct God entities is the same.

BUuuuuuuuut...
It would set a precedent which is a concept that the GOP has always been bad at understanding.
In their support, they'd open the doors for all churches to get investigated.
You love to see it.
