These past 2 days were just horrible, as they usually are after a new missile strike happens.
Here in Kharkiv the situation is stable right now.
Yesterday we lost electricity around 3:40pm, but it was restored pretty fast, some places already had it back up after a couple of hours, for us specifically it took until 11pm, which is still very fast.
By this morning the electricity was already restored everywhere in Kharkiv oblast, but there is still a big energy generation deficit in the system because Russians managed to hit 2 of our thermal power plants, so some cities will have longer blackouts for some time until those are fixed/rerouted.
Yeah.
I laugh at the people making some conclusion based on the nonsense Russians spew.
It is all nonsense, it is not supposed to make sense anyway.
Russian population is fighting because they are full of hatred, all the words are a smokescreen.
Absolutely.
People keep trying to make the distinction between Putin and Russia, and then between the people who are against the war and those for it.
Lunaticsâ€¦absolute lunatics.
Lobbing a massive ballistic misfile at a civilian building.
Unfortunately this missile killed my nieces classmate.
We heard just now.
