The Unites States has acted and continues to act genocidally against indigenous people within and outside its borders, the United States has acted and continues to act genocidally against immigrants (putting them in concentration camps since the Obama administration at least), the United States has acted and continues to act genocidally against black people (in act of intentional cultural destruction going back to slavery's foundation and continuing with black mass incarceration).
The United States is playing a dangerous military game trying to empower themselves against/over the world with NATO as this Russian invasion of Ukraine plays out, and we are seeing oligarchs vs oligarchs behind the scenes as so many of the rest of us (workers, the poor, LGBT+ folk) being used to fight their wars.
