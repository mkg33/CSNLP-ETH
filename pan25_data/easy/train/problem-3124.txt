Well the only city near Lublin Poland that would be a target is Lviv, 200km away.
I don't think it's an error.
I think Putin is seeing what he can get away with.
Everyone keeps worrying about this snowball effect, but the only snowball that will be made is that these countries will know they can take any land with no consequences and will continue to kill civilians in the process.
Need to stand up to the bully.
Are you the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization?
A head of state and commander and chief of the armed forces of a large NATO stakeholder?
No?
The powered range of an S300 is 400 km, and Przewodow (where the missile landed) is about 150 km from Belarus (from which Russia is launching many of its missile attacks on Ukraine), so it's well within the range that you will find if you naively google "s300 missile range".
But when used as a shitty ballistic missile, as russia is doing, the range is much greater because the missile can make most of its flight unpowered (hence the "ballistic" part).
