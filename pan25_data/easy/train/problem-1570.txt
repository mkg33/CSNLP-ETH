I know I'm just saying that being the first victim of a knife attack is understandable since you didn't know, but being the 6th is kinda weird.
How crowded was the place that 6 people got hurt.
You know.
So, you keep peddling that irrelevant and meaningless NRA propaganda (for the profit of American gun manufacturers) as those innocent American kids, partiers, and concert goers keep getting killed en masse for no reason at all.
What they want to stop is kooks and ignorant gullible cowardly gun nuts mowing down scores of innocent kids, partiers, and country music goers with weapons of war designed to kill human beings so quickly that law enforcement (or the mythical "good guy with a gun") can't stop them first.
"Doesn't stop ALL gun violence" is an asinine NRA argument used to fool the ignorant, gullible, and cowardly into assuming that people want to get rid of all guns or that getting rid of all guns will end all evil in the world.
Because ignorant, gullible, cowardly losers can buy this weapon of war to hunt things they haven't needed to hunt in a century does not mean they NEED it, SHOULD have it, or that it's not a weapon of war.
You get that, right?
