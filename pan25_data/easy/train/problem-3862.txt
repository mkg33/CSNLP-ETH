In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yes.
But it doesn't matter.
At all.
Republican voters care about who can be most successful at quickly implementing an extremist agenda.
DeSantis has out-extremed trump.
And Abbott.
r/politics is currently accepting new moderator applications.
If you want to help make this community a better place, consider !
- relentlessly deflecting attention from its anti worker/youth/senior (basically anti everyone who isnt a pro billionaire/oligarch) economic agenda.
I see this as a good thing.
Perhaps this is why the useful idiot still shuffles around free?
Wait until the eleventh hour, and then prosecute, like after the primary's.
That way none of the other options even have time to put a campaign together.
As an FYI, DeSantis is harvard educated.
His anti intellectualism is because, like trump, he knows smart people who aren't straight white Christian male billionaires vote for GOP candidates due to hate and fear mongering, requiring very uninformed voters (see self reported polling from trump voters).
Good.
The more concentrated the primaries are, the less chance Trump can get a repeat of 2015.
The GOP outside of the Trump crazies want to crown DeSantis, and he's the strongest candidate right now (he's neck and neck with Trump in the polls, and he's not officially running yet).
Let's be real here, nobody here is going to like any of the candidates the GOP vomits up, so the fact we're not getting a clown car of GOP candidates is a good thing this time around.
