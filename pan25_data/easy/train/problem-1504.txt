Over time the individuals covered by ECOA has expanded, and as it stands today ECOA discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract); to the fact that all or part of the applicant's income derives from a public assistance program; or to the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
These morons, I hope they get got.
Pulling a real Biden here after the BLM rallies to defund police and he comes up with "We should fund them more" without talking about the nuance of what defund actually means, in most cases it just means making a cop drive with a conscience (social worker etc), The Iranian gov first going "Oh there is nothing we can do, our hands are tied" to Iranians protests of "Stop killing people for Hijab" Then they backtracked (Removing morality police), and now they have backtracked again.
So I hope they get got.
Here's the boot.
