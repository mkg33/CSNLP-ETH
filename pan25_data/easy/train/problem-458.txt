Might be better now, but it was like "central west end" or something near, and you cross the street and you went from sorority nightclubs and hippy hangouts to hood.
Citizens.
Until they are convicted, they are citizens.
The idea that that doesn’t matter is bonkers to me.
If they represent an immediate threat, the answer is to hold them until trial, not take some of their weapons and give them a stern warning not to be a domestic abuser.
Bare minimum, issue the OOP, let the person either A) forfeit their right to a rebuttal, accept the protection order, hand in any weapons they have, and procede to trial or B) Let them challenge the order and let them be heard in court nearly immediately, an absolute basic premise of our justice system.
Hell, I’d be ok with the officer serving the protection order bringing an iPad and a public defender and offering an initial hearing within the first 30 min on zoom if the defendant was willing.
Nope.
Victims are not allowed to defend themselves.
Even in “stand your ground” states.
Look up Marissa Alexander in Florida.
In America, we only punish gun use when it’s a victim defending herself from an abuser.
