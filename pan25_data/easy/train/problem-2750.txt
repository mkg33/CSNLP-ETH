That being said, I perceive this is as a rock-and-a-hard place situation.
If I had to guess, I think Biden’s administration would want to give the workers the rights they deserve, but unfortunately the companies themselves are extremely stubborn and won’t grant it; what makes it more difficult is that with talks of economic recession looming, a shutdown of the railway could be detrimental, especially during the holiday season where spending is at its highest (I imagine).
Yep.
We know it's the greedy companies who are at fault.
The workers voted against the agreement that Biden is asking Congress to force upon them.
The workers did not get what they asked for and the companies are not being asked to give what was asked for.
That is not a compromise.
It is prioritizing greed and corporate profits over the rights and lives of workers.
