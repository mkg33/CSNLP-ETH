But since that hasn’t happened this is probably just political theater.
Ukraine voted to condemn Israeli actions in illegally occupied territory, specifically ethnic cleansing.
Put up or shut up.

I rather clean asses than follow this clown.
UN Security Council Resolution 2334, condemning Israel’s violation of the 4th geneva convention, specifically their actions in illegally occupied territory.

Ukraine voted to condemn Israel for their illegal actions in illegally occupied territories, specifically settlement building.
Ukraine voted for a resolution once again reaffirming that the native people of territory illegally occupied by Israel have sovereignty over their natural resources, and expressing concern over Israel destroying infrastructure in these regions.
UN general assembly resolution 66/225, asserting that the native people in territories illegally occupied by Israel have a right to their natural resources and demanding Israel cease the exploitation of these resources.
