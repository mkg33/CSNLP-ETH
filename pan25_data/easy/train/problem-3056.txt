I'm not saying they shouldn't have been forced to return to a more organized peaceful protest, what I'm saying is that from the beginning people wanted them arrested.
There were only two sides screaming at each other, with no reasonable voice to say, maybe we should give them a more appropriate forum to air their grievances.
I agree that you shouldn't be able to routinely stop services for every grievance but honestly sometimes that's the only way to be heard.
If you make certain ways of protesting illegal, all you are doing is giving the businesses and police more tools to break up legitimate protesting.
Slight contradiction, for hospitals and critical infrastructure, I think its easy to make an argument to ban prohibitive protesting, but there should be plans in place to allow protestors to be heard without interfering with operation of these facilities.
Oh wow.
It was like a conspiracy theory to say what I did on Reddit 5 minutes ago and now its common knowledge.
Never know what audience is around on this site.
