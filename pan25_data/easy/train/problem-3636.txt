They actually do better than that with the proportional delegate allocation.
Everyone above 15% of the vote in a state primary gets delegates based on their vote total.
If you have 100 delegates at stake and 3 candidates who split 40%, 25%, and 35%, those candidates get 40 delegates, 25 delegates, and 35 delegates.
And then, at the end, whoever wins a majority of delegates wins the nomination.
Democrats are further along because they at least award delegates proportionally based on vote total, while the Republicans mostly have a plurality winner takes all system, which is just nuts.
The first party to develop a not insane nominating system that relies on the narrow party fringes who dominate primaries to pick a candidate is going to have a chokehold on the presidency because they'll be able to deliver broadly appealing candidates.
Nope.
Any sign of even reaching across the aisle on a national scale will make the GOP strongly disavow him.
They want an authoritarian strong man who treats liberals like an enemy of the state.
