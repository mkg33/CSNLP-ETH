of USB-C can now output enough power to charge gaming laptops under full load and support data transfer speeds faster than any other type of connector.
There is now no legitimate reason for any laptop or phone to use any other connector other than USB-C for either power or data transfer.
It is the future, a future that Apple themselves contributed towards developing.
Apple played an active role in the development of USB-C and subsequently became one of the slowest brand to adopt it because it would eat into their licensing margins.
This is just what apple does.
Lets take another example.
Have you noticed that all smartwatches charges the same way, a magnetic wireless charger.
You'd think it'd be a universal connector right.
Wrong.
Apple reversed the magnets on the connector of their watches and charger so that theirs would not be compatible with any other brands.
There is absolutely no difference between the charger on a Samsung watch and an Apple watch.
Apple simply arranged their magnets in the opposite order to be incompatible with everyone else.
The entire purpose of the legislation is to prevent brands from doing stuff like this.
It is a pro consumer reform that will save people billions by not having to buy a bunch of cables for their different products.
Not necessarily.
The EU regulation states that if it charges with a plug, the plug must be type C. So Apple can totally skirt that law by removing the plug altogether, they’d be allowed to use wireless charging only.
Not sure how this law changes that though, I’ll have to look into it.
