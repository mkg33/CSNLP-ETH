Yes but whatever data they are after, won't be that actionable.
Taiwan on the other hand...let's imagine we had only known these balloons were surveilling Taiwan and nowhere else, there would be more directed discussion about why China is surveilling Taiwan, and the west would laser focused on that.
But because these balloons are everywhere, whatever is happening in Taiwan's airspace is being treated as an after thought.
My first reaction when I saw these balloons being noted over the US was: what's the point China?
It's not like they don't have a million other ways to spy on the U.S, and there didn't seem to be a clear target.
Unless...their true target is not the U.S and all of these balloons are distractions so we can't really tell what the real mission is about.
So following that thought I was like: Maybe Taiwan should look up and check just in case.
Now we can't really say if Taiwan was their primary objective as we're very much distracted shooting down balloons elsewhere.
Plausible deniability.
The potential ability to jettison the payload in the ocean if you're found out (or from anywhere and hope it doesn't survive the 60,000ft fall).
