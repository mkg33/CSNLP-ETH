Yes other than maintenance, a hurricane and some dumb choice to end production, F-22 is the best fighter in the world and probably wouldn't loose to anything less, and i understand why we dont export that, tho i thought there were rumors of maybe restarting production with japan, dont know what ever happened to that.
As far as not sending the DU i think some people are just worried russia may get that special config or recipe, and as it clearly stands their best was cardboard, but as i said elsewhere; i feel we should have given Germany the Ab's and had them send over more leo's as it would fill the fould quicker and Germany could wait for new ones, or in the worst have to host a few more us tank crews, oh darn, and as u said more now is better, and Uk/Ur?
is already being trained on the leo's and would have better longjistics\ if anything more is needed for them.

Increases inertia to boost ability to deflect or divert kinetic kill weapons (armor penetrating sabots) but that's the US's preferred choice for armor to armor kills so it gets axed in exports.
