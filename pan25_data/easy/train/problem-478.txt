It's very common for property taxes on a percentage/mil rate basis to be super high in lower and middle income areas than in wealthier ones since the rich folks can easily fund services if they have huge houses or a diverse tax base.
They'll try to argue though that somehow this is NOT a regressive tax because they pay more on a dollar for dollar basis (just like they might with a national sales tax scheme) although that is totally misleading.
They try to dupe people who have trouble understanding that a lower income person or a person with little property will pay much more on a per Capita basis than a wealthy person without progressive taxes like income tax which they hate so much.
Property taxes in particular end up being really problematic in lots of places since low income areas end up starved for funding for schools and infrastructure even after raising their mil rates as much as possible while wealthy areas can keep those rates at a minimum to fund top of the line services.
Yes.
And rich folks will go spend their money outside the US while us poors are raked for another 30fucking% on our groceries.
On top of them doubling over the last few years.
