It's important when hurling generalizations to keep in mind there's a separation between the voters and the ruling class.
Voters are often earnest even when being led by their noses.
As for the elected, I saved this comment from another thread, because it's the clean and concise truth of it: "Always remember: their only values are their own personal enrichment and power.
The meandering path they use to get there will change, the explanations will change.
It won't make sense.
It will be self-contradictory.
That is because strategy can change and tactics follow strategy, but what doesn't change are values.
The strategies they employ are solely to achieve outcomes matching their values.

Republicans hitched their wagon to the lowest common denominators all stemming from their Christianity: bigotry, misogyny, hatred, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, and anti intellectualism.
The majority of the US are clearly against the American Taliban and republicans will only lash out more as their cling to gerrymandered minority rule slips away.
This is why republicans are the most dangerous threat to the US according to the entire IC.
