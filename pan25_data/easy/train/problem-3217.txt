Hi PerfectConfection578.
Thank you for participating in /r/Politics.
However, has been removed for the following reason(s):
absolutely.
i'm pretty sure i wouldn't be around today if i had access to guns growing up.
in my high school- early 20s, i had gotten close to the edge on that, and if the quick "solution" of a gun to the head were a few rooms down, i'm sure i'd at least get to the point where it'd be in my hand.
Social media.
Bullying is the foundation of most suicides right?
You used to get bullied at school but were able to escape an come home.
Now it follows you everywhere.
Things like Instagram and Facebook create image issues with kids, because they never see themselves as beautiful as the person with 100s of likes.
Social media has its place, but it's very quickly consuming everyone's lives.
You can't even apply for a job some places without linking a Facebook account.
