No quite literally Hispaniola is a Spanish word and that’s the name they gave Haiti when they colonized it in the 1500’s, literally within 25 years of Christopher Columbus “discovering” Haiti, the Spanish had enslaved a large portion of the population and continued to exploit them for centuries, the French arrived in the early 1700’s and just added to the decline of the Haitian people, who were already heavily oppressed for along time before this, during the French occupation of the western portion of Haiti(the Spanish were still on the other side) they did create the most profitable slave colony at the time.
They however did not begin the enslavement of Haiti or discover it or were even there for the longest time, so I would blame the Spanish for their mass genocides and early enslavement leading to the French occupation of the western side of Haiti, although a contributing factor to the continued oppression of the Haitian people, the French were not the people who first enslaved or oppressed them, Wikipedia takes about a 10 seconds to get to, but you wasted minutes of my life typing this for you.
Hmm.
One of the gangs or a coalition of the same will win.
Perhaps in time the power void will be filled by whatever crime boss manages to conquer or assimilate all the rest.
At least then there would be stability.
Very unlikely.
Dominicans know that an invasion/occupation of Haiti would only serve to further paint them as the bad oppressors and Haitians as the innocent victims.
There is very little to nothing for Dominicans to gain.
Also, Dominicans believe that an assimilation of Haitians would only lead to social-political instability and a fractioning of Dominican society and national identity.
