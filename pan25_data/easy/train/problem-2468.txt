It must really suck to be a Republican right now.
Basically their party clearly has been co-opted, itâ€™s massively lost the respect of the public by not doing the right thing time and again, has become the party for open racism and misogyny, and is moving in very un-American directions - anti-democracy, anti-Constitution, anti equalitarianism, party before country.
No sane American is going to respect that kind of crap.
Better that they clean house from the inside sooner rather than later.
this is not unique to Crenshaw or Republicans but he/they/any political party doesn't lament electing lunatics/undesirable candidates, they only lament nominating lunatics that lose elections.
And terrible candidates still won too many elections in the House and state legislatures.
Just not as many as they would've liked.

Entirely true.
The Democratic party needs new leadership.
Rural America doesn't even know they exist except at the national level because they don't exist out here.
The ones that do run are left to fund their own campaigns with little attention given to them from the national party.
Meanwhile republicans support every election little chance or not.
