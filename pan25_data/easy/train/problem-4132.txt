This was probably 6 years ago and I live in a very low cost of living area, here especially at that time $18 was definitely a living wage and she was not making enough to survive on.
She also hated her job, she answered phones at an office had no room for advancement, but simply viewed herself as superior because she had an office job.
The $18 an hour job was not what I do, it was a very basic job essentially using an overhead crane to drop parts made by the machines like I ran into a part washer, close the door and let it run.
Zero effort or skill required.
She had no benefits, the job I was trying to get her had good benefits.
But if she wanted to keep having to relocate when she couldn't pay rent, begging people for used clothing and toys for her kid, eating ramen noodles to not starve, not going to the Dr because she didn't have insurance not my problem... She makes around $11 or $12 now so about $3 more after 6 years, i make $12 more than I did then and am expecting about another $5 at the beginning of the year.

Without proper protections, these workers could potentially be exploited by employers in the US, resulting in low wages, poor working conditions and a lack for legal recourse if they face abuse/mistreatment.
