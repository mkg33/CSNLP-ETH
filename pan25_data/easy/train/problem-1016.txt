Was he arrested?
No they showed up and secured the scene fortunately someone handled it before they got there.
Hopefully they would have handled when they got there if not but we won't know.
What they do know is he was covered in blood fighting someone so best to just take him into custody temporarily until they understood what is happening.
Try and think from the point of view of what information they have.
They don't have all the information like you do now and when they get there people are panicked and screaming.
People are dead and dying or injured.
They needed to take control of the scene so they could make sure it is safe to start rendering aid.
Try not to be som emotional and think about the process.
In this instance what the police did was right its unfortunate that he was held for an hour but it was not wrong.
A scene like that would take a lot of officers or people in general to get under control with how hectic it would have been.

I wonder where the bigotry came from?
