I have always thought that if the democrats punished 1 republican for the right reason, the republicans would punish 3 for the wrong reasons.
And since balance of power swings around a lot, the come back from the republicans would be 10 fold.
It would set everyone back.
It also makes Democrats HAVE to behave and follow the strictest rules so when that time does come, there really isn’t anything to get them on.
So it’s this hire wire act of dragging shit out to say “LOOK HOW CAREFULLY AND HONEST THIS WAS DONE.
IT EVEN TOOK FOREVER”.
At the beginning of Trump's term, he covertly had a former Trump employee (not an official government employee) purchase a personal cell phone on which he was conducting official business in order to bypass the presidential records act, despite being warned a regular, civilian phone is open fodder for foreign governments.
Right!
So I get why they walk on eggshells.
The democrats have to show republicans that this is an actual REAL case and by doing so, need to drag it out.
We know the republicans will retaliate anyway but Dems also advance policies during these investigations.
