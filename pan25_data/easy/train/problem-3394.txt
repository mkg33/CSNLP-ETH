There is that, but even the none insane fast right parents and their kids are getting worse.
Their are so many entitled assholes.
Way more then 10 years ago.
The problem is that school districts have largely become so sensitive to parent complaints and/or that parents feel so emboldened to harass teachers and administrators such that it becomes impossible for teachers to meaningfully address any sort of controversial topics in their classrooms because the teachers are suddenly put on blast and the school district feels compelled to intervene to put out the fire that conservative activist parents have created.
Some?
In most southern california districts the average teacher has only lasts about 2 to 3 years.
Beginning pre covid teachers were leaving left and right because parents refuse to let the teachers do their job and schools keep hiring career bureaucrats and business people as administration.
The distrust between the classroom and the offices have never been higher and teachers are feeling left out to dry.
Unless you're in a private school (which often isn't much better) or a really wealthy district, the pay/benefits aren't even close to worth it.
