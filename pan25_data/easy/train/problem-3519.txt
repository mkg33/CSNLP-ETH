Only half of the candidates that were supported by the progressive organization Our Revolution won.
Moreover, about a quarter of the Democratic candidates ran progressive campaigns and about 60% of them lost, whereas moderate candidates won about 10% more races.^.
On the flip side there were moderate Congressional members from swing districts that were primaried by the left who subsequently lost the midterms.^.
Absolutely.
Both parties rely on the ability to run on campaign promises that they know they'll never actually have to keep.
They would have to change their entire strategy.
Republicans underperformed at historic levels.
The red wave failed to materialize.
The scenario was perfect for a red wave.
High inflation, low approval rating, historically an incumbent loses the midterms with the exception of 1998 (post-Clinton impeachment) and 2002 (post-9/11).
On average the incumbent party loses 26 seats, the Dems only held a 15 seat majority and the GOP struggled to pick up seats in swing districts making the House a very tight majority.
Moderate democrats managed to hold seats that were expected to go Republican.
Furthermore, the Democrats held the senate with a majority of moderate candidates winning eg.
Kelly, Hassan, and Cortez Masto.
