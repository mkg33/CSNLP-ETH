This is a sweeping generalisation.
The caste system is most prevalent in the most backward Indian states (UP and Bihar).
In a rich state like Maharashtra, while the caste system exists, it's nowhere NEAR as bad.
Not to mention, cases of caste discrimination are taken very seriously.
The further east you go you'll find no caste discrimination at all.
The further south you'll go, there'll be next to none.
In the north and west, it's broadly the same story.
But the issue does exist.
It'd be foolish to deny its existence.
It is, however, nowhere NEAR as bad as you think it to be.

I don't think Bangladesh and India has necessarily the same values though (anti-muslim bill being one example - and the country protesting Modi's visit) - but nonetheless, the US/West would rather have these smaller nations hosting these factories since they don't have the population to be a big problem whereas India does.
