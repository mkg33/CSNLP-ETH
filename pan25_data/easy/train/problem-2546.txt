Maybe Tesla wasn’t invited because the United Auto Workers union was there, who represent GM, Fire and Stellantis workers, and Musk is extremely anti-union and very vocal about it.
He has acted illegally against Tesla employees trying to unionize on numerous occasions in the past, even threatening to if they vote to unionize.
No.
He's not obligated to reward billionaires for anti-labor practices.
Sorry.
You're more than welcome to move to Texas and work for him but Elon isn't giving anyone any indication that he's acting in good faith and his unstable behavior does him no favors.
Please stop.
It's sad.
Musk’s megalomania aside, it would behoove all the manufacturers to standardize on a single charging system and really to standardize onto battery footprints, which would allow the battery swap stations to get off the ground.
Really?
Seems like you're just making stuff up.
He didn't want to involve Tesla because of their extensive history of anti-labor practices.
Elon treats his workers like shit.
