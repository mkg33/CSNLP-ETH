I have a question that I've always been curious about.
Why do people run for president when they know they cannot win?
I assume that getting a certain percentage of votes would open some doors for you?
Maybe it would get you a little national attention needed for future runs?
But then there's people like, I dunno, Chris Christie who's a member of a major party.
I mean he has to know that he's got like .0000001% of winning the primary, and would almost certainly lose in the general.
So why spend all that time and money?
Why the libertarian national party doesn't just pick the one congressional district in America most favorable to them and get someone in Congress to carry their flag and actually propose legislation is beyond me.
Yeah that's the gyst I'm getting.
If your candidate didn't get votes because those voters preferred someone else, be mad at your candidate for not reaching those voters.
This duopoly shit has to end.
