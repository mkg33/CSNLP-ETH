Jim's problem is that classic folly of thinking that he's smarter than he is.
And that being smart will save him from missteps.
But he's also not that smart because he hitched his wagon to a con-man who gets caught and not only for dumb things, but doesn't/can't save others.
So Jim rolls out there, no jacket as always, and yells like whatever he is saying is the end-all be-all.
But he's also not a trial lawyer so doesn't know all his stupid rhetoric won't save him from getting fucked in the courts.
And I, for one, welcome him playing this dangerous game like a proud, idiotic zealot.
I hope he sits in a prison cell like a moron going, "How'd I get caught???"
Listen, if no one heard of your political prowess before Trump and you were already there, there's a reason.
Only idiots come out of the woodwork for a man who thinks exercise shortens your lifespan.
I hope he only dines with Gaetz from here on how so they can have a criminal's pact before one of them goes to jail for being stupid/perverse.
That is all.
DOJ is under the authority of the attorney general specifically to prevent what you suggest from happening, and the attorney general can appoint investigators who have pretty broad and relatively untouchable authority to investigate and recommend convictions.
This issue has come up and been dealt with in governments past and there are laws providing protections against it.
