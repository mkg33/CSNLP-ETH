Today some missile strikes did happen, so it was a bit less quiet than usual.
At around 11:35pm we heard some explosions, about a minute later an air raid alert was triggered and that was when we realized that the explosions were from Russian missiles.
We didn’t have any prior warnings, so the missiles were most likely launched from some unusual place, probably somewhere deeper in Belgorod oblast.
Dominica from Mariupol.
“Do you know that now you are russian, that Mariupol is russia?"
the occupiers told the girl.
She answered "Even if it is captured now, that doesn't mean that I'm russian...
I'm Ukrainian".
russians destroyed lives if our kids.
“Upgraded”.
Meaning… can load and launch any of the 13,000 different explodey-things that are in the NATO catalog of under-wing explodey-thingys.
Really interesting.
Sounds like NATO/USA is currently the last hurdle.
This was announced awhile ago and then didn't happen as they want USA to take the jets and provide them to Ukraine rather than providing them directly.
