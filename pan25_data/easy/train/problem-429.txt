Yeah, because he's part of the DOJ, which is an executive branch department.
Biden has control over the DOJ (though not direct control, as the Attorney General is supposed to function independently of the President, which he is, considering Biden found out about the special counsel the same time everyone else did during the press release).

But Reddit tells me that Smith and Garland and Mueller are all shills who are really working to protect Trump while pretending they're investigating him seriously.
Because the guy who prosecuted corrupt governors and congressmen and war criminals, and the other guy who prosecuted Manuel Noriega and John Gotti, have dropped their passion for the rule of law out of a deep fondness for some orange NYC reality show grifter.
Why?
DOJ officials are too scared for their own careers to make a move against the Jan 6th instigators.
