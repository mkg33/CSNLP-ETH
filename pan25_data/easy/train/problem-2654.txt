No, but they represent energy that would have come from fossil fuels otherwise.
People are going to use energy.
Thus far the overall growth in demand, as China, India etc reduce poverty and people gain access to electricity, has outpaced the rate with which we can manufacture and install renewables.
But manufacturing capacity for renewables is scaling, and about 90% of new capacity these days is just solar and wind.
No one considers it a solved problem, all done, we're good now.
Ecologically "renewables" are a fucking disaster.
The waste stream for PV for example is seventeen times larger than nuclear.
And it only works during the day, when it's sunny.
Oh, and the toxic waste products, many of them remain toxic forever.
Unlike nuclear waste which eventually becomes non hazardous.
Yes, the time scales are stupid long, but at least they end eventually.
Solar and wind have not been successful in pushing coal out of the electricity market.
See Germany.
Nuclear has.
Yet the "green" advocates have a fit when it's suggested.
