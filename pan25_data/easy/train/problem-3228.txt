Exactly.
I've been saying this since Trump's rise.
He was the inevitable conclusion to their Machiavellian manipulations and fundamental inhumanity.
Nothing but a Trump would do for a populace they constantly made fearful, angry, and ignorant.
He's the mirror of all they've become.

My friends who are right leaning despise Trump and recognize he’ll be the demise of the GOP.
It’s not just MAGAGA people who think that, and that’s just a reality that Dems will have to confront someday.
I’m for sure in the moderate camp in most issues, but if I’m being honest, it’s that exact attitude that I think makes the Dems so out of touch with reality.
I know it might seem crazy to you that the GOP still wins elections at all levels, but we have to remember that they still won the popular vote this cycle.
They’re also increasingly making gains in every voter demographic, so I feel like the question should be, “Why is the Dem party bleeding constituents across the aisle?” rather than having the attitude of, “I can’t believe the GOP even wins elections.” You know?
I have had progressive friends make similar remarks in the past, and IMHO (even if you believe it’s true) it comes across elitist and kind of alienates moderates/independents.
