Also, just for those unaware Perry is objectively terrible.
He is a fascist, a criminal, he hates the EPA, his families business is responsible for poisoning his own constituents, he was directly involved in the insurrection and openly advocates for using the military to overthrow the US government.
Among other terrible positions.
Add to that the fact he is a retired general with real influence on the military just like Flynn and you can see why some of us have been concerned and advocating against this guy for the last 25 years.
I honestly think if Perry got even a quarter the attention from the media and party they put into pointless other races Perry would have been gone years ago.
Perry only generally wins in my estimation due to the same mistakes that always seems to be the issue with stereotypical old school Democratic party.
They spend almost no money in general on this race dispite it being a winnable district.
They put up bad candidates or candidates with no name recognition, spend no money on TV/internet/advertisement.
I actually know quite a few of the folks living in the district who always try to convince the state and national party of this for it to fall on deaf ears.
Basically, from my understanding the the old school Dems running the party in the area ignore them.
