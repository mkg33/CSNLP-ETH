I went to HS with a woman whose first job after college was as an aide to Sen. Bob Packwood.
One night after office hours, he tried to seduce her and ended up making some aggressive moves on her after a few glasses of wine.
Once the news surfaced about him attempting the same with multiple women, he was forced to resign.
DC's a small town and no one would hire her after that.
So she got assaulted by a creepy, drunken olguy AND had the best part of her resume turned from a cash cow to a pile of shit.
At least she didn't know what a scumbag he was before working for him unlike these bottom feeders that will gravitate to Santos.
And why do I get the feeling Roger Stone might mentor the young demon?
When they discover how much more they can make doing direct mail/email donation solicitations, some of them might go legit, under the broad interpretation of Citizens United, which essentially legalized bribery and helped make contributions (bribes) by foreigners untraceable, for politicians.
Is what i was thinking the other day.
If he lies and lies about everything why would he not lie about doing the job.
Whoâ€™s material is he passing as his own?
how do we know he is actually doing his committee assignment.
