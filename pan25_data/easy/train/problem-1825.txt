“I’ve had a great relationship.
In Delaware, the largest growth in population is Indian-Americans moving from India.
You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin’ Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent.
I’m not joking.”.
Listen, i'm not gonna bother dissecting the rest of what you're saying cos i just have zero interest in anything that you have to offer in the form of an opinion on either the article's subject or some lame attempt to falsely equate Biden's senile quips in attempts to ingratiate himself to certain voters to ardent and open racist politicians enacting legislation to further socially, politically and materially harm people like me.
Thanks very much for proving my point.
The willingness to defend Biden's bigoted statements is deeply corrosive to any kind of politics that tries to advance racial justice.
Attacking people for quoting Biden's multiple well-documented racist statements from his decades in public life doesn't make them go away.
It amounts to reality denial.
When people do that about bigotry it has bad results and very specific political valence.
