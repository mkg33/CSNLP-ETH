Unfortunately I think there are quite a number of countries that would be interested in allowing Russian military installations on their territory if it means they can thumb their nose at the US.
Venezuela maybe...
But that's a dicey game.
There's a lot at play and I find it unlikely they would actually follow through.
Also consider the geopolitical ramifications.
How would China feel about Russia parking nukes in NK?
It would clearly cause the US, Australia, SK and Japan to beef up their deterrence measures which is the exact opposite of what China wants.
Unofficially.
It's actually incredibly rare that we get to know the actual DEFCON level, with retroactively being told we hit 2 during the Cuban Missile Crisis being one of the only times.
Disagree.
Every one of these nations vote almost unilaterally in favor of Russia in the UN on contentious issues pertaining to their invasion of Ukraine.
Cuba...
The US could do better by them, but I suspect the leadership is in no rush to turn back time 40 years.
