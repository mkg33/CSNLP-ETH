I guess the more apt question would be, why is this taking so long for what are what appear to be very cut and dry cases.
The snails pace that this has been going at, only leads people to believe that he will never be held accountable, and the apparent inaction is one thing that is hurting the country as a whole.
If you talk to most people, they either believe he did nothing wrong, or the government is protecting him by not prosecuting.
Interesting question.
I think the short answer is: that wonâ€™t really be a factor.
The question will be how the facts line up for each potential charge.
Your question does, however, lead me to think about the Mar-a-Lago investigation (one of the two DOJ probes, the other being Jan. 6).
Because there, the general issue of classified/national defense information forms the factual backdrop of a potential criminal case that could come from that investigation.
But ultimately, in all of the several probes into Trump, I think it will be more about the direct question of how the facts line up with the specific text of each criminal law at issue.
