My great-great grandfather was a bootlegger during Prohibition, made a shit ton of money.
When the Dust Bowl/Great Depression hit, he had the cash to buy a ton of real estate and businesses, opened a factory, etc.
The family became quite wealthy.
And, like the bunch of white trash degenerates they were, most of them boozed, gambled, and squandered it all, grandma included.
One of her favorite stories is from the '60s when she was approached by a group wanting her to invest with them in building apartments/condos in a sleepy little mountain town called "Aspen".
Her reply, "That's the middle of nowhere, nobody goes up there!"
Good call, grandma.

What are they going to do?
What can they do?
Dissolve the bank?
They couldn't.
It's owned by shareholders.
All the shareholders, all the wealthy families who own stock across the biggest, most expansive corporations, they would have to simultaneously and collectively call it quits.
Which doesn't even make much sense.
That would spell ruin for humanity.
