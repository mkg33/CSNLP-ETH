Ron DeSantis loves sticking things up his ass.
NTTAWWT, but he really, really loves it.
I understand that when he visits somewhere they have to remove any object that could possibly be inserted into his anus because he just can't control himself, it's a compulsion.
He often has to have them surgically removed because he inserts them so far up his own ass.
It's well known around Tallahassee, that's why he has trouble hiring personal aides.
He usually asks them to help insert and remove various objects.
At times he's inserted light bulbs, turkey basters, baseballs, snow globes, lava lamps, fruits, canned vegetables, frozen beef tenderloins, smaller musical instruments, dumbbell weights, beer bottles, liquor bottles, socket wrenches, shoes, dog chew toys, magic 8 balls, lobsters, brake linings, bicycle seats, rolling pins, travel irons, collapsible umbrellas, flashlights, spray paint cans, and bocce balls.
The only thing he won't stick up his ass is dildoes "because they're gay".
