I'm not too sure to be honest, but the Saudis view the exportation of extreme fundamentalist Islam as a form of Soft Power, much like the US and Korea do with music and movies, so I haven't noticed a decline in this push but I'm also not in the mosques very often and my arabic is pretty terrible so I wouldn't catch the subtleties.
Good luck to them.
That's gotta be a different kind of hell for such a threat overhead, forever.
There are some great people there.
There is also massive religious backlash for anything seen offensive.
Violent backlash.
I wish them a long and happy life regardless.
maybe XD i try to jump in when i see news about Yemen bc there is a lack of information flow and i think they get a worse rep than they deserve usually hahah i've lived in way shittier places XD I think most people just hear the same perspective over and over and it dehumanizes a lot of super average people who are just caught in a shiiiiiiiiiiitty situation, and by dehumanizing entire religions/nationalities/groups based on the actions of their few worst leaders we allow more extremism to grow.
