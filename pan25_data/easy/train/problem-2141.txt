Yes, Russia is clearly causing direct destruction on a much greater scale (and engaging in far more systematic methods of genocide, like kidnapping children).
But that doesn't mean that suddenly all lesser war crimes are absolved.
My point is that if we ban one country from competing in the Olympic games because they're committing war crimes at the moment, we need to ban every other country doing it too.
There can't be any debate.
We can't start arguing, "well country A's invasion of country B caused 30% less casualties than country C's invasion of country D, so country A is allowed to participate but not country C".
It's completely silly to assign value to human lives when debating something like this.
War crimes are war crimes.
The 2 year alternating schedule is too frequent to make the games impactful (I've barely watched the last few), and it encourages the ridiculous constant building of unnecessary infrastructure and the bloated, corrupt bidding process that often leads to host cities spending billions they don't have on massive budget overruns with minimal support from the IOC.
There is nothing to dress up.
Itâ€™s a historical fact that the US did not invade Vietnam.
They came to the aid of the South Vietnamese government.
