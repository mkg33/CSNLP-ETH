If I had to guess, it's likely because Trump took more documents, Trump took hundreds of docs, I don't think the number of docs Biden had has cracked 10 yet, though I haven't checked recently.
There's also the fact that Trump's documents were apparently of a much more significant nature than Biden's, while both had classified documents, classification has different levels.
We know that Trump had several documents that were of the Sensitive Compartmented Information level of classification, which are the nation's most closely guarded secrets, often detailing intelligence methods and sources, and while we don't know the classification level if Biden's docs, it's likely they are of a much lower classification level, both judging on the governments in gaining the back (Biden had these documents for several years) and the lack of news coverage regarding the classification level of the documents (if they were of the same level some one would have found out and broke the story, the executive branch is pretty leaky).
i mean does it?
literally nothing happened to trump lol.
Like...
APPARENTLY its meaningless if trump had a shit ton, empty folders in his desk with missing docs, didnt cooperate, lied, etc.
and still nothing happened.
So biden having some old ones laying around and not being used anymore obviously is pointless right republicans?
?
