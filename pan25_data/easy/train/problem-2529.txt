You mention daunting costs of transition but what about the costs of adaptation?
Unless by adaptation you mean “palliative care for the human race while we die off”, adaptation has no end date as long as we emit greenhouse gases.
Adaptation is also extremely expensive:
60 years) (...).
This means that only 42% of human CO2 emissions remain in the atmosphere.
Land and ocean CO2 sinks have continued to increase proportionally with the increasing emissions (...)" - their data shows that this 42% of AF seems to be "constant" over the period 1960–2016.
according to the scientific data and mesaurements - the overall CO2 lvl in Earth's atmosphere in 2020 was at 149% of a lvl from 1750 (set as 100% - pre industrial era).
Mankind (in general) is responsible for CO2 that amount to circa about 0,000925% of Earth's atmosphere.
But hey "80% MORE" sounds scarier than "only 42% of human CO2 emissions remain in the atmosphere in 1960 - 2016", right?
The rest is being absorbed by natural sinks and there seems to be no radical (none at all...) increase in the AF remaining in the atmosphere so ... no longer so scary.
