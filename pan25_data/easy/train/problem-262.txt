Why the hell isn't draft dodging a valid reason to seek asylum?
"I refused to fight in a monstrous war of aggression so the government will put me in prison if you send me back to my country" is a textbook case of what asylum is for: people who would face persecution and oppression in their home country.
I did.
They are a lost cause.
They are not running away from Russia cause of their morals, they are running away to save their skin.
And they still believe that Putin is the best.
very inconvenient as a destination for a political immigrants.
The stats depend not on the country but on who reports the stats.
Unfortunately I'm not surprised, the EU countries' migration agencies have been treating russian asylum applicants extremely harshly since forever, going as far as to deport LGBT couples and political activists facing death threats while saying "Russia is a democratic country, you're not under threat".
This should be such a slam dunk.
How the hell better can you help Ukraine than by assisting in the draining of Russia's conscriptable manpower?
They should be giving out cash rewards to every draft dodger who crosses the border.
Encourage more to do it!
