I'm out here in rural Eastern Oregon thinking, "I really hope this isn't another Democrat-led initiative that's focused on metro areas, or limited to women and minorities...".
Same here.
Our county Democratic Party does nothing.
They occasionally have candidate fundraisers, always at the president's personal home, and it's more of a vanity club for herself to meet officials and throw social parties than it is a political movement.
Exactly.
My community is considered heavily Republican, but we only vote 60% in that direction.
It wouldn't take much to tip of you votes if any effort was given.
Logistics-wise rural areas would still need their own community motivators/leaders to spearhead operations.
Look at how close the last election was.
And you have no idea how cheap rural areas are.
You can run a local news website for like $4,000/year.
Do that in 80 rural markets, and you're already a good way toward breaking these bubbles.
