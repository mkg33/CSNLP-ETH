Mark Meadows, he's treated me probably fairer than most, and that's not a problem, and the only problems that you have are on the side of the Radical Left because they hate your Constitution and they hate Trump, which is probably a Mortal Sin if you think about it.
we had many many millions and billions, we never had anything bigger than we did with Saudi Arabia, King Mohammed, or MBS as I like to call him, and they did a lot, not as much as me but a lot, and then we had tremendous amounts of Great Freedom, you've never had that under Sleepy Joe, you've never had anything good with the Radical Left, never had anything good because of Crazy Nancy and others, and they say that she could've maybe done something bad to Paul, who knows, but it's probably true.
don't forget, I came in, "Sir, we have no Helicopters," I said how could that be, "Obama, Sir, he gave everything away to Kenya," I said isn't that nice, here you have things so incredibly perfect under Trump but then the Democrats have to go and destroy it just like they've destroyed a lot, believe me.
we would've never even had a UN if it wasn't for me.
I fired James Comey and that took off a lot of heat.
ok, you can donate now, donate later, just remember we're fighting the Radical Left, you're welcome.
