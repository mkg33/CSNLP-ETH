Inhabitancy: Although England repealed Parliament's residency law in 1774, no delegates spoke against a residency requirement for members of Congress.
The qualification first came under consideration on August 6, when the Committee of Detail reported its draft of the Constitution.
Article 5, section 3 of that draft stated, "Every member of the Senate shall be .
.
.
at the time of his election, a resident of the state from which he shall be chosen.
"On August 8 Connecticut's Roger Sherman moved to strike the word "resident" from the language dealing with requirements for members of the House and insert in its place "inhabitant," a term he considered to be "less liable to misconstruction."
Madison seconded the motion, noting that "resident" might exclude people occasionally absent on public or private business.
Delegates agreed to the term "inhabitant" and voted against adding a time period to the requirement.
The following day, they amended the Senate qualification to include the word "inhabitant" prior to passing the clause by unanimous consent.
Yikes!
I had no memory of Walker playing for the Vikings.
Can we all now go back to pretending he never tainted the state?
We have enough suffering with our Vikings letting us down at the end of EVERY season.
