Endometriosis is no joke either; I watched it turn a strong af hardheaded women into a crying mess in fetal position and she just powered through it.
It’s crazy to think someone should either work through that or use sick time (I mean it’s once a month, even taking one day off per month - that’s 12 days and the average number of sick days allotted in the US is just 8) or third option - jump through hella hoops to prove it after multiple doctors visits to get the paperwork and diagnosis like guys cmon lol.
I am a woman.
My friends are women.
I don't have much pain, but they do.
And when they do, they take painkillers and get on with their life.
If a woman has such debilitating pain that even painkillers can't touch it, it's probably endometriosis or some other treatable underlying condition.
They should not simply stay home and suffer.
It's crazy to me you think employers are going to enthusiastically vocalize discriminatory hiring/promotion decisions when they can just, y'know, not, with zero repercussions.
All you have to do is call the other party a better holistic candidate and suddenly it's meritocratic.
