I mean... idk.
I grew up around pretty much exclusively republicans.
I was 15 when 9/11 happened.
Before that, they were also racist, sexist, misogynistic, homophobic, gun loving, white business owners, or down on their luck momentarily broke millionaires.
They decried "welfare queens" while taking disability, social security, writing every personal expense off as a business expense that they could, etc.
They viciously joked about "violent thugs and criminals" (black people) and illegals while hiring undocumented immigrants under the table, committing crimes ranging from DV to SA fraud to theft, drugs to murder and suicides.
I knew and saw a lot of violence, criminality, hatred, and not a lot of brown faces from the direction they were coming.

Machismo.
Fascists show disdain for women, disregard for chastity, and condemnation of homosexuality.
Yes, it is.
If the government takes over production, it's fascism.
If workers do, it's communism.
That's the literal litmus test of which is which.
Selective populism.
Under fascism, the “voice of the people” is not the democratic majority, but only the voices of those who support the leader.
