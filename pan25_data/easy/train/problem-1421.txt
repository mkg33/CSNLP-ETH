We don’t need to convince every single person of these things.
We need to make (and are making) big systemic changes, and people are along for the ride whether they believe or not.
The shift to renewables is already in full swing.
It should be noted that these are 2020/2021 numbers and 2022 was a banner year for renewables.
I expect the next two years to be even better.
Public adoption of renewables is picking up speed, and our infrastructure is finally starting to catch up.
It’s way more cost effective to invest in renewables now for regular households, businesses, and governments.
You save a hell of a lot of money in the long run, and the government will help fund your switch.
Small businesses and ag producers are especially leaning into the change.
It’s great for their resiliency and bottom line.
Toronto, Canada.
We're getting a couple of weeks of spring here.
The grass looks green everywhere, in the city.
A week from now the temperature starts going below zero, but barely.
30 years ago the city had two ski hills operating within its urban boundaries.
