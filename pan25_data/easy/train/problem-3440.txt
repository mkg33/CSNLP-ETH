Butterfly mines are designed to be able to be dropped over an area from an aircraft without detonating on impact, which means they can be deployed indiscriminately.
They also are antipersonnel mines and are triggered with 5kg of force applied to them, which theoretically means a child could trigger one, as opposed to anti-vehicle mines which typically require at least 100kg of force to go off.
Lastly, they are made with plastic frangible components rather than metal which, while having a lower chance of killing a person, will seriously maim them and make treating the injuries mine-clearing after the conflict much more difficult (metal shrapnel can be spotted on an X-ray with a metal detector while plastic shards cannot).
They are.
The mines Russia dropped months ago will still be there and are still going to be dangerous.
Hahaha.
I smell manure.
Ukraine destroyed their butterfly mines.
Russia refused to sign the agreement to dispose of them and kept them, while Ukraine disposed more than 500k.
No doubt Russia is using them in this instance, as earlier in the war.
Russians are so full of bs these days that no one will trust a thing these granny raping poops say for the next 20 years.
In the meantime, I will be looking for Poutinâ€™s death notice on the front of the newspapers.
