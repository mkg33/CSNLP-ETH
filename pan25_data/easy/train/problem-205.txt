The argument, as I understand it(correct me where you think I’m wrong) is that nato is definitely expanding, which does put legitimate pressure on Russia.
The 2014 maidan revolution was very heavily influenced by American and British intelligence agencies, and regardless of how successful they were, Putin knew this.
As the war began, peace talks were shot down by the west, namely the Americans and British.
America is now using this as a proxy to, in the words of Victoria nuland, head of Ukraine foreign policy, “weaken Russia to an acceptable level in line with US foreign policy”.

Ukraine should be allowed to choose its own destiny.
To say that Russia was concerned they might join NATO and that I'm supposed to be sympathetic to Russia as a result - that presupposes that Ukraine should be treated as a pawn and that it might be ok to "sacrifice" their allegiance and well-being for the sake of making nice with Russia.
I reject that notion and I think all nations should have the right to pursue alliances of their choosing.
They are a sovereign state.
