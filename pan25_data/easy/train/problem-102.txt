There are Russian troops already in their country; it's really just a political question as to HOW Putin takes it over.
Does he just keep the useful idiot in charge?
If Luka got deposed, Putin would just park some assholes at the top like he tried doing before Maidan.
So they have some hard choices to make and would want an EU kind of group to help push back or ease that pressure via a safety agreement etc.
But of course, Luka cannot be trusted so they have to figure it out without a government in place to do the negotiating.
A weird issue for sure.
The victory at Khalkhin Gol and subsequent border skirmishes led to the signing of the Neutrality Pact, which allowed the Soviets to re-deploy Siberian Troops to the western border to participate in the Battle of Moscow, a very crucial moment in WW2.
5.
Allow Lukashenko to keep the military and police in Belarus to crack down on dissidents and enact martial-law when the pro-democratic opposition becomes too strong.
Overall?
It's a move on Ukraine's move I support as it costs them nothing and might neutralize a potential hostile force through inaction.
