I went to school in Ukraine in the 00s and it was taught to us.
I guess mileages vary.
Not surprised about the blackout as it was happening though.
The Soviet handling of the disaster was terrible.
However, what I do not buy is this idea that, for most Russians, the term “Chernobyl” does not ring any bells.
I am very skeptical of this “Russians don’t teach about Chernobyl” thing that’s been floating around on Reddit.
Chernobyl is definitely a part of East-European pop culture.
The soldiers either did not know that they were in Chernobyl or they were from very poor eastern regions where no knowledge of Chernobyl is only one of many education gaps (that are not caused by censorship).
Aye.
And I worry China is waiting for the US to draw down its munitions.
The great strenh of the US in WW2 was its manufacturing capacity.
That has passed to China.
They'd have to convince their population however that Ukraine was a dastardly NATO feint to deplete them (hence the justification for redeploying as its still part of the same campaign), and they'd probably need to negotiate a closed door agreement with NATO to provide a symbolic build up in Poland first to make it look plausible.
