I'm probably more progressive than Biden; but I'm extremely happy with his term so far.
That said, I would greatly prefer someone with similar politics to him but younger.

I really liked her early in the primaries but she wasn't good enough on the stump.
She would probably be a great POTUS; but might not be able to win unless Trump runs as a 3rd party and splits the Republicans.

The other side of that coin is old people accepting responsibility for the fucked up situations created by voting for shitty people for decades.
Let's hear it, old folks, step up and take the blame you deserve.
