Texas also has driving taxes a.k.a.
tolls and a s\it ton of other "user fees" that are taxes by another name.
Plus high property and sales tax.
They get you one way or another.
As said above, there's no free lunch.
EDIT - I wrote a personal account of experiences of friends who’ve turned away from more progressive candidates in favor of more conservative ones and pointed out these are people who actually live life by more progressive ideologies and am being told it’s BS and down voted.
Id say it is kind of humorously ironic if it weren’t for the fact that feel this internet hive-mind mentality is what’s ultimately going to make progressive ideologies (which I find far better than most of the regressive conservative ones) fall behind the opposition.
Its a shell game.
These states have lower taxes but all those things you pay for in "high-tax" states you have to pay for privately in states like Florida and Texas and those things are MUCH more expensive in those states.
