This is the definition of tyranny.
Any voice that disagrees with the state mandated propaganda is silenced one way or another.
I still can't believe I used to watch RT daily thinking that western news was propaganda.
But slowly we are turning into a place where the minority is silenced just like in Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran.
Free speech should be free speech.
Silencing someone because you don't agree with their opinions is tyranny.
Free speech has been stifled for centuries if not millennia.
People can't tell fact from fiction.
They just believe whatever the media tells them just look at North Korea or Iran or Saudi Arabia.
Hell even in the US all we have is fox or CNN no independent news outlets exist anymore just more propaganda pushed by the elites all over the world trying to brainwash us into believing whatever they spout on the TV or radio.
Close your eyes.
Imagine if a sudden scheme exists that can release every serial killer and human scum immediately for a bribe and there's zero risk to it.
Imagine it's going on right now.
Open your eyes, it's 2023.
