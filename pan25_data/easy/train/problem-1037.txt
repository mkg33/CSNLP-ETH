And before the downvotes and "not all of them" people come storming in, ask yourselves.
If there are just people among them, actual honestly good people, why do they not intervene?
If there are good amongst them that outnumber the bad (as so many claim) why do they continue to let children be raped and exploited?
Why do they pray to a god that lets these things happen?
Is it gods plan than children be so violently fucked they expire from blood loss?
Is it's gods plan that those who are supposed to serve and protect get a harem of little boy sex toys to use as they see fit?
Some even refusing to be posted in areas they _can't_ fuck children in?
Is it gods plan their people live in a system where grown men can claim another as property?
Choosing to violently murder their daughters and wives for minor inconveniences or just because they feel like it?
The rest of the world has chosen to demonize these things centuries ago but we should just ignore this fifth century bullshit cos of Muhammed?
Because of religion?
Execution is state-sanctioned homicide.
If it's lawful then by definition it's not murder.
A bit pedantic, I know, but I think semantics are important.
I also disagree with execution, period.
