Honestly you’re just silly.
The Japanese already fought the ussr in ww2.
In 1939.
Stalin already went for land grabs on Poland and the rest of the baltic states.
In what world do you think they really thought the Russians wouldnt land grab them too.
If the Japanese are telling us they surrendered because of the bomb who are you to say they’re lying.
The Russians kept fighting after the Japanese surrendered unconditionally.
Remember that on the 10th of august a day after the 2nd bomb.
The Japanese surrendered conditionally to keep the empreror.
When that was rejected they came back 5 days later and surrendered unconditionally.
Confirming that the ussr would attack them would already be expected.
They weren’t holding out the last hope of better terms with the ussr who already fought them during the war.
A silly narrative really.
Unlike the firebombings, which were conducted at low altitude and allowed the military to return fire, the atomic bombs could be dropped from altitude not particularly accurately and still hit every military asset in an area, and required committing only a single high altitude bomber to do it.
