Use established territorial control to devastate Ukraine's forces in key areas early before they get more Western support.
Yep.
McConnell has united with Schumer in support of Ukraine.
Pretty rare that they put partisan politics aside, McConnell especially, ever since the Bork nomination that brought out his vengeful side against Democrats and especially Biden, who was central to the proceedings in the 80's.

Pull back on direct offensive efforts and proceed to strategically shell Ukrainian territories indefinitely, while slowly encroaching and annexing territory over the course of several years.
Except they're not wrong though.
That's why Russia had to turn to North Korea and Iran.
They can't support this war effort logistically.
It's also why there's now concern China might start providing weaponry.
Russia prides itself as a weapons exporter, not importer.
This only happens if they have depleted their stock.
Very typical Russian strategy.
In fact very typical of dictators who have no qualms of throwing troops to the slaughter.
Putin has no issues at all.
Who's going to complain to him, who's going to vote him out.
Putin controls the death count figure and controls the media.
He has a security regime that can scoop up recruits and send them off.
China would do exactly the same thing, just throw thousands at the enemy and lie about the casualties.
