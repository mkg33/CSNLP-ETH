That happened here in Canada with our school support staff (everyone but the teachers), they went on strike and the government legislated them back to work using some law to force a deal and limits wage increases.
The union told them to get bent and said they are striking anyways even if they faced fines.
Other unions across the country stood up and supported them and the government ended up having to walk back the deal that they forced through.
I mean what was the government going to do fine and arrest 50k workers ?
The power is with the people we just need to start realizing it.
A monopoly on legislation?
Sure.
Suggesting that the entity (not even the government, milutary, or police) of Norway has a monopoly on violence in order to shoehorn the actions of a country’s government is quite simply misleading.
4.
Dictatorial leader/Central power with surpression of opposition, Norway is a very strong and consistent democracy.
Wow.
So if you strike for 10 days, you’re not getting paid that year.
Why go back to work, then?
Seems counterintuitive on the government’s part if they’re trying to get workers back in their jobs.
