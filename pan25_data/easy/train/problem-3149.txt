Putin has to be severely desperate with the way oil prices are going.
They were expecting a vastly different situation for 2023 and are getting absolutely annihilated on the front lines.
I agree.
However, despite remaining optimistic, I doubt that will be the case.

As a person living in an ex-soviet nation, I can see this phenomenon happen around me everyday and it is TERRIFYING how easy a grandma is made to believe that it is good to sacrifice her sons for a cause that is in truth utter bullshit.

He has ruled based on an impression of strenh.
He can’t just back down, and admit the full situation.

Russians don’t care about their own death toll, as long as they can get something for it.
