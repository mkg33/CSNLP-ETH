With the exception of a few games, like poker, where there can be bluffing, and players are competing against each other instead of all playing against the house, all casino games have known, fixed, odds, and known, fixed, payout rates, and gamblers can just find or figure out the odds and decide whether to play or not.
There's no volatility in the odds, except in sports betting, or the occasional promotion at casino where they pay better odds than normal to get people in the door, eg, casinos sometimes change the odds for craps for certain types of bets, but those usually have fixed durations (eg, Monday only, or weeknights from 8-10, etc), so the odds aren't changing in real time, and you certainly can know them before placing a bet and can lock them in, even if they will later change.
