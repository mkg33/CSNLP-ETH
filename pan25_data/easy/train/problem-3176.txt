If you REALLY want to "prepare" combatants for real challenges, start with a course that has no end date.
Put them on a calorie deficient diet.
Make them build useless things under impossible conditions, like runways in Burma, during the monsoon seasons, and if anyone gets lippy, you force them to stare at the sun, while buried up to their neck in sand.
Yeah, put combatants on that regime.
If they quit or die after 3 months, they're not fit for service.
Dudes is just complaining cause he was violated with a dildo in the ass while being forced to jerk off in front of female soldiers that were ridiculing him about having a small dick and ridiculing him about how he could never really satisfy any women with that itty bitty thing while the hung sergeant pulled out his cock and the female soldiers told him thatâ€™s what a real cock looks like and you need one of those to ever be able to really satisfy a woman and then they made him eat his own cum.
Why not?
Religious people have been fine killing other people since the beginning of time.
It is all a matter of justification.
They just need to get right with it somehow, usually by fitting it around an internal code.
It's resistance, not invulnerability.
By delaying talking, the information becomes useless.
They are taught to feign injury and reveal as little as possible.
