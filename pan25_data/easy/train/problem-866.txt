This swap was a brilliant move by Putin.
He forced Biden's hand because it was either this deal or no deal, and Putin knew that it would further drive the culture war in America, and pit Americans against Americans.
It is working.
Unbelievable.
As a life long Rasta, I’ve been to jail in 4 or 5 different states in this country for nonviolent cannabis arrests.
I still have warrants in a few.
I haven’t been able to go back to my former home state of Wisconsin in over a decade, because of not wanting to be kidnapped and held captive over a bunch of cannabis years ago….
Nuts.
Ive been jailed for long periods.
Done hunger strikes, protests, all sorts of legal appeals, religious rights, etc.
They didn’t have to trade anything to let me go, let alone a crazy arms dealer.
I swear to god, if they every try and mess with me over herb again, I’m going to lose it after this.
Such hypocrisy it’s sickening.
How?
He's not a magician.
He sold stolen Russian arms for years.
He's part of the reason that Russia is having supply problems now.
He'll get tossed out a window like all the others.
Absolutely not.
Russia propaganda (states media) are already hailing it a victory and depict Bout as a hero.
You are just making baseless assumptions that Bout sold weapons without Russia's permission.
