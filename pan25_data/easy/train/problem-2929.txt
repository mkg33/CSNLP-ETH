Ah, but you aren't allowing for Governor Grassisgreener.
Governor Grassisgreener as president will do it all -- free healthcare, balance the budget, $40 an hour minimum wage -- no, $50, why not?
-- free college, defund the police while putting more cops on the street, get Roe codified, pack the court, end the filibuster (until the GOP takes control, at which point Grassisgreener will reinstate it, but Grassisgreener will be so awesome the GOP won't win any elections anyway), legalize marijuana -- hell, you name it, Grassisgreener will do it with ease, all with a winning smile that will make him or her adored by the public, with the highest approval ratings you've ever seen, because Grassisgreener will be doing the things the public wants done.
I don't understand why the Democrats refuse to nominate such an obvious choice.
I guess they're just a bunch of dumbass corporate stooges.

Uhh, now you’re stepping into ableism here.
I get what you’re saying, we don’t want a president dying in office.
But we also have to be mindful of these things as well.
