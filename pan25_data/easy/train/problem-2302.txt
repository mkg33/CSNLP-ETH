That's the problem, they are not long dead.
The people are, but the ideology persisted and is now extremely vocal.
I'm not talking about people being against the Israeli government and their actions (frankly the Israeli government can fick right off).
I am talking about the uptick in attacks on Jewish people and organizations here in America.
I am talking about the blatant antisemitism coming from the right through hate speech, symbols, and actions.
I'm talking about people like Kanye and Trump saying bigoted, racist, antisemitic shit and people agreeing.
Their voices have galvanized numerous people that are either ignorant to these intolerances or have always felt them and now have a mainstream voice.
Your opinion is a prime example of people that are not affected by it saying "it's no big deal.
".
If pretty much every example of a nation inspired by Marxist, Leninist, Maoist, or otherwise communist thought has devolved into authoritarianism, maybe that proves it is just a fundamentally flawed ideology.
