Technically, the Chinese (ROC) had the first escort carrier before Wight Brothers made their first flight.
It was a commerical vessel that was laid down before the first flight, refit by the Japanese to be a seaplane tender, then like most of the Republican Navy, end up getting destroyed by Imperial Japanese Navy.
Pride.
They're also probably not going to use it like the US does, at least not with traditional aircraft.
I think they're going the way of China and see carriers as massive drone motherships instead of landing areas for piloted aircraft.
If you're using drones you might not even need a runway, saving lots of space that you can use for even more drones.
Iran has shown they're developing drone technology.
For what it's worth, I think that's their plan.
Then you are eliminating US Navy amphibious assault ships, Japanese helicopter destroyers, and possibly others from your definition of “aircraft carrier”?
Do you know what's really funny?
The West underestimating a new and untested naval technology developed by the East and then getting their asses handed to them for their hubris.
That surely hasn't happened before, especially with something like an aircraft carrier.
