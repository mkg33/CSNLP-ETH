I wouldn't call that a ethnic cleansing since technically, the Jeju masscre didn't happen because of the victims's ethnicity or race.
It's just a mass murder.
S. Korea, in particular, received compensations and apologies from Japan on numerous occasions, starting with the 1965 treaty (although the South Korean government wasted all of that money on their own economy instead, which is just shameful), more compensations were sent in the 1990s and more recently in 2015, coupled with numerous apologies, but I bet you didn't know that or even cared to research, for that matter, because JaPaN iS BaD.
This topic is a really interesting one.
The whole reason for Korea sending troops is one that South Korea would love to forget.
LBJ was so desperate for other countries to participate that he offered ludicrous trade deals to willing partnersâ€¦.
Those trade deals are a huge part of the financial foundation that built modern day South Korea.
