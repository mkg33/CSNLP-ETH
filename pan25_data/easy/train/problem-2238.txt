I agree with you that this wasnt intentional, but I did want to mention there's a number of reasons why Poland is desirable to Russia.
Exactly.
This is a bullshit half-statement to simultaneously attempt to maintain the integrity of NATOâ€™s strenh while also avoiding any sort of actual retaliation.
1.
Historical Russian Empire had parts of Poland, and Poland was part of the Eastern Bloc.
Putin pretty clearly spent Covid pandemic fantasizing about the Russian empire and USSR.
Biden is trying to keep his cards close to his chest.
What you don't want is something reactionary.
If it can be determined that this strike came from the black sea, you can expect more action against Sevastopol.
This missile offensive is also possibly going to lead to ATACMS being released to UA.
If it were found to be a deliberate bombing, you'd see a lot more action.
This is still likely to grease some wheels.
Ukrainian here.
You've hit the nail in the head, mate.
Western anti-air missile are so much better than the soviet S300s we have.
The West gave us IRIS-T and Hawks, but in minuscule quantities, we can't cover the whole sky with units whose quantity you can count on one hand.
