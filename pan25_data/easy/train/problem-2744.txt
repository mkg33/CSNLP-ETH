Ukraine is one of the most corrupt countries in the world, even more so than the Philippines.
The fact is largely underreported, because people don’t want to seem as if they aren’t supporting Ukraine, but there have been huge corruption scandals.
We shouldn’t underestimate how much corruption is part of the very culture of government in Ukraine as it is in Russia.
We can’t make excuses for Zelenskyy if we really care about Ukraine.
He stood with his country in a time of war, but that doesn’t make it impossible for him to make mistakes or act against his countries best interest.
He had known about the problem for some time, and known how dangerous it is in the context of the war, but hasn’t done too much to root out the corrupt officials.
Why?
Romania has made significant strides in its efforts to combat corruption (I was reading about it tonight actually).
It is possible to stamp it (mostly) out.
The Ukrainian people don’t really have a history of democratic institutions, and their culture itself is developed in the context of an authoritarian regime.
