I live in Nanjing.
My girlfriend and I are just now recovering from Covid.
Both our parents have gotten it.
Basically every friend we know have too.
One million is definitely underestimating.
Half of the people I know that live in big cities have caught it, a smaller fraction for smaller towns but still, China is crazy populated with over 1.4 billion people.
Researchers can't extrapolate COVID cases accurately.
Anyone that tells you this is just trying to get funding.
We can barely track whole regions that have outbreaks.
Their culture minimizes the individual and maximizes the collective.
Authoritarians use this to their advantage to create powerful, lasting, autocratic governments.
My gf and I both had two shots and one booster.
We always wear masks when in public, always wash our hands first thing back home.
She commutes to work regularly, while I work from home and don't go out very often.
All these didn't stop us from getting covid.
The people of China have never really experienced a functional government where individualism or individual decisions where revered or held up as important.
Even if they were presented with the option of democracy, they would reject it.
