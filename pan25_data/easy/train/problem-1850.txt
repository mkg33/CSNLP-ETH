I wonder if the sophisticated missiles are more diverse than Brimstone IIs, but even just hundreds of those is great.
How infuriating!
If I called home from war talking about killing and losses on our own side, and my father were just non-stop spewing the latest propaganda from the telly rather than listen to the conversation, I would've felt so lost.
Exactly.
It would would be dumb to announce that Ukraine gets tanks but they will arrive in six months.
It may better to let Russia think that they won't get them and then all of sudden there are western tanks at front of the surprised Russians...?
Absolutely criticism works, on democracies.
More specifically, criticism from constituents.
In fact, without criticism, democratically elected leaders hate doing things.
Doing things that nobody is asking for is putting your neck out, politically.
Responding to criticism is being a good representative.
Huge commit.
Especially the hundreds of armored vehicles.
Bulldogs are tracked APCs.
Some variants are IFVs.
