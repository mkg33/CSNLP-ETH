Not how it works.
Buybacks are the company acknowledging they don’t have better organic uses of the capital (eg no Capex projects or R&D they can invest in), so they are returning the money to shareholders.
It is most prominently a feature of mature industries / companies.
The money they return to shareholders via buybacks can then be reallocated to more productive segments of capital markets (eg startups, growth companies in need of capital, etc) which is ultimately more productive for the economy.
Sigh, fuck it.
Enjoy the win bro, you Canadians sure did stick it to the man, I bet all your finance guys over there are shaking in their little dress shoes.
This is a cause to celebrate….
Hey guys wanna join me next week to stop climate change?
I’m thinking about planting a tree in my front yard.
My bro Luke down the street has throat cancer, he cut back on smoking to only 2 packs a day(he was at 2.5 packs) I think that’s cause to celebrate.
Compensate fairly.
Be more valuable, get more money.
But that value has to be assessed outside of the executive suite, just like employees don’t set their own remuneration.
