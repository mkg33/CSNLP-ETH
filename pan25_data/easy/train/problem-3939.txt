I think you mean the whole middle east.
The whole point of making things war crimes is to keep everyone at the same level of morality, if your enemy isn't abiding by them, you can defend yourself without doing some things that don't look bad without the proper context.
For example, you can rightfully claim the Israel shoots rockets into civilian areas in Gaza, but because Hamas isn't following international law, there are legitimate military targets in the civilian areas which brings Israel to strike there to begin with.
It's a catch 22.
Israel controls imports because a lot of materials are used for terror, also and especially building materials.
Gaza is unhappy because Israel is extremely restrictive.
Etc.
Most settlers are not violent.
Those who are are very successful at being violent.
Just look at the locations of cases of violence.
Mostly in the areas around Nablus and Hebron.
There are (sadly) settlements all over the West Bank, but most are pretty quiet.
You rarely find settler violence in the Etzion region just south of Jerusalem (and when you do, they are always from Bay Ayin), rarely from the Jordan Valley, and rarely from Binyamin region.
It really isn't all that many people who cause so many issues.
