That said, they're still very risky, much more expensive, and training on any aircraft is way more costly and time intensive than ground vehicles.
Their efficacy is what's really in doubt; even if helicopters are still seeing combat use, there's not as much actual evidence of tactical success or lack thereof.
It's a lighter step than sending western jets, but attack helicopters have a very limited role in the current conflict because of the saturation of air defenses on both sides.
Granted, that does not mean they'd be useless - both sides are still employing helicopters, even in combat on occasion (indirect fire missions with missiles are common).
The engagement ranges and accuracy of western helicopters like the Apache would be noticeably better than the Mi-24 and Mi-8 gunships in use too, making them more effective in the roles they're being used for already.
This.
Sending attack helis with the current AA situation wouldn’t be super ideal.
The Ukrainians aren’t pleased with their old mi24’s but Russia has been losing a ton of Ka52’s and mi28’s this entire war and as a result they’ve almost stopped using them entirely.
