If we did, I bet we would have treated him with tremendous respect, because it would have been colossally stupid, as well as a tragic waste of life and a once-in-a-generation talent, if we, say, used the full weight of the British government to criminally prosecute, publicly humiliate, and then haze him into suicide early in his career because he was gay.
Good thing Perfidious Albion isn't actually that perfidious, right?
...right?
There is a parallel between autopilot development in airplanes and similar systems in land vehicles, and thatâ€™s in terms of how much assistance they provide to and how extensively they can be trusted by the pilot/driver.
It took decades for aircraft autopilots to be reliable and accurate enough to be certified to land airplanes in poor visibility.
The human-machine interface needed to accurately engage operating modes and convey system status to operators has evolved significantly in airplanes, and the odds of failure that would cause loss of life are somewhere around 10^-6.
Well I have one too.
I hold the wheel at 2 and 10 but you have to wiggle or turn one of the scroll wheels every few mins.
Even holding the wheel is not enough to the extent I don't use autopilot any longer.
I just keep it to the regular adaptive cruise.
Boy, if only we had some kind of computational mega-genius who could have substantially contributed to early AI research and possibly set it on a safe and ethical path in addition to being more responsible for the downfall of the Nazis than any other single individual.
