Boy, are you so smart.
lol.
I don't get why white ppl would follow a latino who supports white nationalism.
Why do they trust him?
It makes no sense to me.
For example, Benjamin Franklin didn’t consider Germans white, the US as a whole didn’t accept Italians as white until well into the 20th, the “one-drop rule” only impacts whiteness not blackness in the eyes of those in power (Barack Obama), etc.
It’s also why white supremacists and Nazis target Jewish people, even though their skin is the same color — because whiteness is not defined strictly by color of skin.
I hope this basic explanation is enough for you to understand why a Latino with light skin aligns with neo-Nazism and white supremacy, as well as potentially prompt you to learn more.
