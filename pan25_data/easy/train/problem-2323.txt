This is why we need to be branding the republicans party a communist cult.
We need to do it every day.
We need to have the younger generation think it’s funny to make stupid baby boomer republican cult members go crazy by calling them communists.
If you look at stalins communist Russia and the Soviet version that followed it is exactly what the republicans are doing.
Russia is the end goal for republicans.
Strong central government filled with a cult daddy and loyalists.
Loyal Oligarchs owning all the levers of industry and doing what the government says.
No right to privacy elites choosing leaders not the people.
Banning books and doing religious and nationalized education.
When you really look at it republicans are a communist cult.
Liberals refuse to call them that.
Refuse to play the game and that why we lose.
They don’t give a flying fuck when you call them Nazis.
They don’t care when you call them Christian nationalists.
They don’t care when you say they are authoritarian.
Little Ron Desantis is going to call us all commies when he gets power and will be given total power by a cult of weak men with massive daddy issues.
Hell call you a commie but you won’t call someone who repeats Russian talking points does Russia bidding and views Vladimir putin as a strong leader a dirty commie.

Turning everyone into dullards that will only vote (R) sounds great until the dullards cannot fix your infrastructure, run your power plants, drinking water treatment facilities....
