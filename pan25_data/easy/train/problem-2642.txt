Yes, they just act entirely of their own volition, have certainly not been directed by the executive nor had budgets fucked with by the legislative, just 'dumbing down youth' on their own, never any Republicans involved in trying to destroy the entire concept of a public education system.
It's not the poster's brush.
That poster didn't popularize Rush Limbaugh for them or decide for them that an attempted coup that featured an armed insurrection having been planned from the White House itself isn't a big deal, much less a deal breaker.
That poster didn't make anyone endorse stacking the SC to effect a partisan take over of a branch of government that needs to be non partisan for our checks and balances to function.
They didn't make anyone smear their opponents as waging war on Christmas as a way to attack Christmas.
They didn't force them to suddenly start calling people like me "groomer" for not agreeing with their perverse genital obsessed and government over reach orientated politics.
I could go on.
