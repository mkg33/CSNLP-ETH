In order to expand its interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the GRU units transferred many of the documents they stole from the DNC and the chairman of the Clinton Campaign to WikiLeaks.
GRU officers used both the DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0 personas to communicate with WikiLeaks through Twitter private messaging and through encrypted channels, including possibly through WikiLeaks’s private communication system.
Shortly after the GRU’s first release of stolen documents through dcleaks.com in June 2016, GRU officers also used the DCLeaks persona to contact WikiLeaks about possible coordination in the future release of stolen emails.
On June 14, 2016, @dcleaks_ sent a direct message to @WikiLeaks, noting, “You announced your organization was preparing to publish more Hillary’s emails.
We are ready to support you.
We have some sensitive information too, in particular, her financial documents.
Let’s do it together.
What do you think about publishing our info at the same moment?
Thank you.”159.
Snowden acted entirely independently.
It'd be a different scenario altogether if for example Greenwald had pressured Snowden into obtaining the NSA data and supplied him with password cracking tools in order to clandestinely gain access to secure data.
Because of Assange's involvement with Manning in obtaining the data, he moves from an investigative journalist into a co-conspirator.
Lol.
Tell me more about how you haven’t even looked at Mueller’s report before spewing this hilarious ignorance.
