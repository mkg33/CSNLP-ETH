I get my power from a local nuclear plant.
I drive a Nissan Leaf.
It's the super cheap base model.
150 mile range.
It's great.
Even in the middle of winter it gets me 3 days work commute plus a few errands.
In the summer all week.
I charge it on a regular 120 outlet.
I initially want to upgrade to a level 2 charger with a 240 dryer style outlet, but I honestly never found the need.
It chargers more than my daily needs slow charging.
Funny, as the FBI in 2008 released declassified documents showing a vastly deep network of material support for the 9/11 hijackers from people within the Saudi government/intel agencies/related networks.
And quite a lot more has come out.
US presidents have their head up the ass of the corrupt Saudi officials, no way they'd allow anything that explosive to come out.
Also the "no way Saudis would have anything to do with al-Qaeda" is not accurate, just look at the insane funding for al-Qaeda/AQ linked militias in the Syrian conflict as well as before 9/11.
Incredibly possible.
However, it is not in the Royal families interest for the US to leave the Middle East as bin laden demanded.
I think what you were saying is possible but I havenâ€™t seen any evidence for it.
