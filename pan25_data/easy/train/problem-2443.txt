The UK has no bargaining power any more in any of this, which is exactly why the UK rejoining the EU in any way shape or form is such an impossibility.
If anything the UK has lost sovereignty in leaving the EU, because now you're still subject to EU laws for anything you want to sell to the EU, only now you don't have a seat at the table any more, so instead of being part of deciding EU laws in Brussels, you're just subject to them.
In a way this is a good thing.
British arrogance led to Brexit.
Britain was never really in the EU mentally.
It was one foot in and one foot out.
A lot of Brits need this humbling experience and rejoining the EU as a more equal member, along with adopting the Euro would make Britain and plenty of Brits finally appreciate what the European Union is actually for.
We had decades of the press blaming the EU for everything and making wild claims about the European Parliament ruining British traditions and clearly a lot of knuckling dragging Brits fell for it.
Now some of them realise they have been duped.
Sadly a lot of other peace voters are so bloody minded theyâ€™ll never accept Brexit was a gross mistake.
