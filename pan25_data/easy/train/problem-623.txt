Federal judicial appointments are extremely important to our democracy, and unfortunately trump desecrated many of our federal courts with his hyper-partisan appointees.
Thank you!
When will people realize that conservative doesn't automatically translate to far-right (in religion, politics or anything)?
Extremes are a problem... in any area.
In this scenario, where the prosecutor is absolutely not an impartial adjudicator, the defendant does not get to speak to the prosecutor before being charged, and the defendant is legally presumed innocent, it's okay to temporarily suspend their constitutional right.
So it's not like a conviction that overcomes the presumption of innocence is required.
This is true, but the Due Process Clause does not require presumption of innocence before taking liberty away in a civil action.
