I work in the nuclear industry which is required to follow work hour rules set forth by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
The NRC is an independent federal agency.
We are only allowed to work 26 hours in a 48 hour period, 72 hours in a seven day period, average no more than 54 hours a week in a 6 week rolling average (outside of during a refueling outage), must have minimum of 10 hours off in between shifts, must have 36 consecutive hours off in a 9 day period.
These rules have been deemed necessary to guarantee the safety of the general public.
We can’t have half awake zombies running the plant it dangerous.
If the plant violates these rules there are consequences ranging from fines to ultimately losing their license to operate.
So it goes without saying plants adhere to these rules strictly.
I guess the point I’m making is there is precedent here to have a federal agency enforce work hour rules when the safety of the general public is at hand.
I’d say losing 40% of the countries freight instantly would be considered a public safety concern.
Seems like something like this should be considered.
Exactly.
The fact that they couldn't even give people paid sick leave is appalling.
I really do hope they strike anyway.
With the labor market the way it is, they'll never be able to hire enough scabs to get the railroads safely operational.
