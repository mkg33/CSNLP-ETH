i always wondered about just how much collateral damage is wrought by this entire iron dome concept of missile defense .
you have a missile incoming , let's launch another one over our own territory to intercept it .
i suppose a hit just rains debris over a large area alleviating a gigantic blast but a miss just doubles the effectiveness of the initial launch .
so is war ?
Considering itâ€™s a much higher probability of being Ukrainian stray AA then a Russian missile going that far off target, and insanity higher then Russia deliberately targeting Polish territory.
Yes very much so.
Russias military is being depleted, the are politically isolated and their economy has been set back for an entire generation or more.
Pretty much the only way this happens, ya.
Or the detonating missile was Russian and was successfully intercepted, but it was a incredibly unfortunate soft kill and the warhead did a 1/1000 to still hit someone after being partially disabled.
The actual impact crater is inconsistent with an intercept munition, although that is never hard evidence.
