There are plenty of unauthorized construction done all the time.
But usually the IDF comes tearing it down or disperses people before they can really make progress on anything.
Naturally.
As he needs to wait for new unauthorized settlements to be established first.
Once that has progressed enough, they get authorized.
Rinse and repeat.
Due to recent terror attacks in which 9 Israelis were murdered over the course of less than a week, plus ongoing public criticism about lack of deterrence against terror attacks, the government decided to legalize 9 previously unauthorized settlements, symbolic of the 9 victims, in retaliation.
Yeah...
The hypocrisy right there from the Israeli thieves.
You steal land and then offer them "peace" if they just eat shit under your unreasonable terms.
Funny how you're deflecting from the question trading land back for killing the Palestinians and directly to "peace".
For all the innocent lives that the Israeli settlers killed, do they get some land?
Or it just apply for the thieves?
