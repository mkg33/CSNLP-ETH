A leading figure in the gang told Sunday Life: “What’s on the table doesn’t deliver the end of the Irish Sea border.
Interesting experience.
I inadvertently wore a felt suggesting sympathies (per Irish friends) into a restaurant in Northern Ireland, like the day after an incident where a guard was shot.
The whole place went dead quiet.
I actually felt a pretty uncomfortable.
When I whispered to my girlfriend ‘man, everybody’s so quiet!’ I think they realized I was a clueless foreigner and started talking again.
That was fecking wild.
I didn’t find out about the shooting until a few days later when telling the story.
Negotiations over the Northern Ireland Protocol are “inching towards conclusion”, the Taoiseach indicated on Saturday.
I went into some random restaurant and felt like I was in danger over a hat.
I don’t think many people outside of Ireland get the depth of feelings over this issue.
(Edit: to , which is really just a fedora.
REI still sells the same hat, even the band is the same.
).
