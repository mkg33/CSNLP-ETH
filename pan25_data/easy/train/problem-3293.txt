Yeah, I disagree.
I think you are oversimplifying their modus operandi, and I don't think this type of over-the-top rhetoric is helpful to our cause.
This type of rhetoric just makes our side look ridiculous when SCOTUS dismisses Trump's frivolous election and Mar-a-Lago lawsuits (as they have done), because then conservatives can just point to those as evidence that the Court is not entirely partisan and argue that liberals are being overly paranoid.
Those sound bites matter.
This is a reminder that rates of gun deaths per Capita are highest in deep red states where guns are prevalent, pro gun laws are well established, gun culture is fervent and ubiquitous and these gun totin' "patriots" are supposed to be saving lives, protecting their family, their property, thwarting crime and maintaining law and order within their communities.
California presents an example where over the years, it can be concluded that these things have been affected by the implementation of certain gun laws, in connection with other factors as well, while things like homicide and death rates are on the rise in these red states also, and disproportionately so.
The topic is about California, so I made a comparison to California, not to New England or wherever else.
Either way, it's not inconceivable to draw certain conclusions from this data, i'd say it's much less conceivable to claim that the data and commentary doesn't point to the relationship between gun laws and death and homicide rates.
And by the way, your last question is entirely faithless and you know it, homicide rates weren't what was mainly being analyzed, while the very idea still stands, that comparatively, these rates are still higher in those republican led states.
