I disagree only on the idea that fighting Russia conventionally will lead to massive casualties.
IF we imagine a fairy-tale world which Russia does not use nukes, I don’t see too many reasons why the result of an invasion of Russia will not be similar to an invasion of Iraq.
Even the planners of Desert Storm expected high casualties and a long stalemate before eventual victory…we know that the exact opposite happened; and Iraq was a formidable enemy.
Really glad to find someone who has the same reading as me.
You know what is the opposite of pride?
Humility.
We live in a binary world and it's time to put the focus on humility.
Human nature tends to change the world from the outter instead of the inner, as it should be.
Willing to continue this thread in private...
I agree expecting NATO invasion on Russia (or even better Ukraine armed with western weapons invasion on Russia) is insane and dumb idea (too much video games or Hollywood movies) but if Russia can collapse because of war with Ukraine is another problem.
Soviet Union collapsed partially becauseof their failed invasion on Afghanistan.
