So it's like my working duties yea.
I think you're thinking of my contract?
My rota has all my hours on it and any hours I owe, any hours they owe me, it's where my study leave goes and I can look at it and see when my holiday is, when I'm working, when I'm off, who's working with me etc.
So when I get to a certain point in the year in order to make sure I take all my holiday my manager will say you've got 70 hours to take (which is like two weeks) so I've given you a week in jan and a week in feb and that will be evident on the rota.
If you don't take it within the financial year you lose the holiday.
Definitely.
MAGA is aligned with the workers in this case because a strike would create an economic shitshow that "owns the libs" they've still got all those i did that stickers to use and gas prices are dropping.
Its not about workers rights for them, they vote against those consistently.
Seriously?
My friend works retail and gets a week.
I work in food service and get a week.
I dunno where you're working, but I would quit if I were you.
