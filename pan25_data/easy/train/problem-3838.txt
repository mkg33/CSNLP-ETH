When the Germanic tribes appeared they didnt really mingle with the Britons, they made their settlements outside of the Romano-Briton towns and cities.
Yes it was a big migration but not as big as people think it is, because you can see it in the DNA makeup of people in the UK, Britons and mostly those in the East have up to 10% of Germanic DNA the rest is Celtic/Briton, so there was no replacement or anything, and at most what happened is that the Germanic tribes eventually took over and people assimilated into their culture because it was easier than resisting.
No my friend.
There are human beings driving this thing.
With human beings at every junction making horrible and irrational decisions.
No.
No public school in the US (paid for by the public not the same as a UK public school) is allowed to have any forced religious activity.
In my opinion the Constitution also forbids voluntary religious activity if itâ€™s led or organized by the school, but exactly where that line is drawn is debated.
