Let’s not be too biased, people.
If we’re going to talk the accountability talk all the time, let’s set an example of accountability.
Bipartisan accountability.
How shit like that isn't enough to kick Townhall off the whitelist, I don't know.
There are conservative / right-leaning outlets that routinely get posted here and produce decent levels of engagement, but Townhall and Daily Wire are just offensive drivel from the angriest of agitator-pundits and add no value to any sort of meaningful discourse.
So?
The comment chain you’re replying to is specifically discussing Townhall’s editor’s note that advertises their bias in 200-pt flashing red font, not the veracity of the story.
As the previous commenter pointed out, there are conservative outlets which aim to inform their readers, but Townhall is not among their ranks.
It exists to push a specific narrative and plays fast and loose with the facts in its singular mission to drum up right-wing outrage.
