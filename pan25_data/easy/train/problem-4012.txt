They were the most eager of all, to the point that they waived the 7-year initial period during which people from those new member countries could not move to that country (unlike, for example, Germany) and years later the high number of EE immigrants was being leveraged to push for leaving the EU.
Sadly they don't care.
It is actually good for them.
By this, they can push their narrative even stronger: EU, Brussel, the west is baaaad; opposition whose fault this is (yes, they just said this yesterday that we wont get the money because the opposition who cant do shit as the fidesz rules with a 2/3, is at fault) is also baaad.
They did everything they could but everybody is just so against us, bruhuhu.
Hungary is heavily reliant on EU-subventions and the EU-domestic market.
They’d been bankrupt within days, if they decided to leave the EU.
On the other side EU-laws only allow to sanction Memberstates.
The EU can not „vote kick“ a member (which would probably the easiest solution).
At most they can try to „bully“ a member into leaving themselve, which the EU is actually trying, but most attempts are actually blocked by Poland, who is flirting with authoritarianism, too.
What?
Its a valid question.
The EU isnt purely an economic alliance and Hungary most certainly isnt representing the EUs core values.
On top of that Hungary isnt even a net payer, meaning they get tons of cash while simultaneously shitting on the EU.
