North Dakota: A law is being passed by legislation that prevents libraries from allowing books containing sexual content on their shelves.
Librarians who resist the bill can be subjected to jail time.
The sexual content also refers to sexual orientation and gender.
There are exemptions for books relating to biology, anatomy, or other scientific or artistic significance.
