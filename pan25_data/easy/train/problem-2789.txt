I am an adult.
I just have gotten tired of having to be the bigger man.
If they want or support policies or beliefs that would result in my death then I donâ€™t have the time for them.
Our children are dying for their gun rights, how many people did we lose to their politicizing of COVID, or Voting against healthcare or even just reduced cost of lifesaving drugs like insulin or against feeding school children when free school lunches may be their only balanced meal of the day?
Not to mention they have been sowing violence and refusing to make any steps towards controlling the results of the hatred they spew.
I will have compassion for them the moment they show even the slightest amount of the compassion that their messiah told them to have towards their neighbor.
I will not wish for their deaths, I will not take action to being about harm towards them in anyway.
But I will not give a damn if they leave this earth and leave it all the better for their absence.
American politics aren't divided down liberal and conservative lines anymore, it's divided by reality and fiction, it's divided between creating solutions and creating problems.
