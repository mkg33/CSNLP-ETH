As someone effected by this legislation the method with which this was passed was very frustrating.
Whether or not you agree with the bill, the fact this was started on Friday at midnight by attaching a gun control bill to a amusement park ride safety bill that failed to be voted on because they forgot to ask the amusement park safety bills sponsor if he was okay with that, so he refused to put it to a vote.
Then attaching it to a women's heath bill, then ultimately to a bill that adjusted the responsibilities of public insurance adjusters before it passed the senate.
Which was brought up late in the day tuseday with public input, limited to less than 5 min per witness to speak on the matterbeforethe vote was held.
With illinois witness slips for the changes at a ratio of 100:1 in opposition on less than 24hrs notice.
This is a big deal and makes felons of thousands of responsible Illinoisians while doing nothing to statistically reduce gun crime.
Because Cook county where most of the gun crime in the state occurs has an assault weapon ban.
Which they do not enforce, other than to bring them as changes to be dropped as part of a plea deal from mostly poor minorities who can't afford a legal team to challenge the ban.
