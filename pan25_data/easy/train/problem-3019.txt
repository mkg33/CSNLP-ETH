But have I?
It takes a lot of resources to build a car.
If I get rid of my 2018 Toyota Prius for a new Tesla, how long do I have to drive the Tesla to cover the environmental impact of consuming 2 vehicles within 4 years?
I still don’t have an answer for this.

For the record, I’m very pro EV.
If you’re in the market for a new car, buy EV.
But I don’t think people should get rid of their perfectly good cars for an EV.
It seems very hard to believe that buying a new car is better for the environment than not buying a new car.
Furthermore, EVs have a portfolio of energy sources.
So I’m likely to still burn some fossil fuels to power it.
