The article explains how the sick day issue is really just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to all of the ways the railroads are completely fucked due to them slashing payrolls.
This leads to insane and unsustainable staffing availability requirements and railroads not being able to meet existing regulatory requirements.
Hope they don't give in so easily.
The government and media has told them time and again that a strike would be catastrophic.
Basically telling them exactly how they win.
So fucking do it.
Privatization without regulation is a problem, just like nationalization of utilities leads to service level issues without a vast government investment.
You make it sound like this isnt already being done.
The Railroads are required by law to run safetly and efficiently and it is regulated by Government Transportation division.
The RR have no real responsibility to uphold this as it would naturally make it to Congress and Congress would always favor the RR.
Every year the RR shut down more Rail yards, more rail lines, reduce labor and make the current labor try to maintain something that took double the people 30 years ago.
And they have been doing this for years as these political unions that donâ€™t represent rank and file try to play politics rather than try to argue labor rights.
