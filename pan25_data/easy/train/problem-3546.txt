When they say family values what they ACTUALLY mean is that the father is the authoritative patriarchal head of a nuclear family where all other members have an obedient and submissive role to his decision making, providing an unquestionable grassroots level, cultural model for their preferred model of government.
It was truly a dark time for me.
I was already insanely addicted to Xanax and heroin but when my wife took her life with my gun and I discovered her I went off the rails in ways I never imagined.
I knew there was fent in those "oxys" I just didn't care if I lived or died at the time.
I still have good buddy's stuck in the rut but my experience isn't enough for them.
They didn't have the "luxury" of almost dying to really put into perspective the things that are most important in life.
If anyone is in this position reading these comments, you can beat this shit.
There's more to life.
I promise you.
Love you guys.
Absolutely.
Somewhere down the line they threw out a lot of what being a real man is, and focused on dialing up what was left to 11 so it rubs people the wrong way.
