Personal experience, lost a very close family member who was a college all american and played 5 years in the pros as a fullback.
He was a bright loving husband, but when the CTE reared it’s head, it did not take long before we were hiding the car keys, he made it less then 6 months in full time care before he passed.
It happened very quickly.

That strike most of the Dems I know as too conservative, but I think there's a velocity where you bring about change that, when exceeded, ends up losing more people than it gains.
But no one's paying me for political strategy, so I just vote.

Never heard of him”.
It is really very sad in my opinion.
