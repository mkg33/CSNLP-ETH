What exactly is the point of this quote.
Specifically why is it sandwiched between the above quote and a paragraph about similar battles in other states.
Also, why is there not a following "How?"
behind that quote?
The legislation doesnâ€™t include funding to expand the Capitol Police, which is controlled by the state, and leaves the locally-controlled Jackson Police Department, which has lost hundreds of officers in recent years, to continue policing the rest of the city, including neighborhoods with the highest violent crime rates.
I'm still confused by this though.
So a majority of white residents in Jackson no longer are able to elect their own judges or prosecutors as well as a significant amount of black residents, totaling a bit more than 1/3rd of the city.
Those residents are still paying taxes to Jackson but no longer benefitting from some of the services created by those taxes.
Instead the services for this district are funded by the state.
