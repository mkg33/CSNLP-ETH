It really wasn't.
The Russians didn't mind that it happened, and certainly supported it, but acting like there hasn't been considerable and organic opposition to the EU pretty much since the UK joined just doesn't stand up to scrutiny.
A combination of bad luck and bad British policy produced generations of Britons who felt wronged by the EU.
The first generation was victimized by bad British policy.
When the EEC was first coming together, Britain stayed out because they had the idea that they were going to turn the whole sterling area into a kind of economic bloc, and much of the old Empire would come together to allow Britain to occupy a sort of 'third power' space between the superpowers.
This policy was common to both Labour and the Conservatives, but Britain didn't have the financial muscle to pull it off, having largely been wrecked by the war and dependent on loans from the US and Canada.
So Britain stayed out of the EU and missed the boat, being unable to join later due to De Gaulle's bitterness over the war and belief that the EU could be used to secure French control over the continent leading him to veto.
Get a job.
Get two paychecks.
Don't have to worry about getting conscripted to get beaten up by a superior, eat alpo for a month, then to get scraped up after getting hit by a missile full of bomblets.
