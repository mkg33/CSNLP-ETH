The point being, undoing the reestablishment of Israel is not a feasible option.
While many are trying to come up with realistic solutions to create a lasting and just solution, complaining about 1948 does absolutely nothing.
Anti-Zionists need to drill this in their heads: violence against Israel hasn't worked, boycotts against Israel have not worked, and social activism against Israel has not worked.
If you are serious about a just solution, recognize and accept that Israel is not going anywhere and work towards peace.
Even if this is your position, how is this relevant to a conversation about how to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?
Israelis are leading the world in many tech and medical sectors, and its economy continues to grow despite negligible resistance from boycotts.
Even countries with antisemitic populations that have been at war with Israel have since normalized ties and commerce because they need Israeli tech.
Israelis are being productive, while anti-Zionists whine on the internet, hoping that with enough whining, Israel will disappear somehow.
Ha?
Jews lived in the are for thousands of years.
It was Muslim invaders who occupied the land and oppressed / cleansed Jews for hundreds of years.
