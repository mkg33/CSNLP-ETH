I understand US defense contractors profitting off it from afar is no better a compromise, and to a degree we're already involved like other countries defense contractors are; but this situation is not exactly as black and white as people want it to be.
No.
No one wants that.
This is like the worst IRL Trolley Problem, but 100k+ people have already died.
Putin is unpredictable though.
No one knows what to do.
Exactly.
It's the long game that matters.
Putin signed legislation to protect ex-presidents from prosecution in Russia, but post-Putin Russian leadership can still send him and other war criminals to the Hague if that gets some sanctions lifted.
I would not object.
At the time I posed it this way: imagine giving a million dollars to each of 2,000 public schools _every week_.
How much good that could do.
Munitions are one thing which the US has supplied despite Russia's acknowledgment of them doing so, but if they encourage Ukraine to attack outside of their borders as well like you're suggesting; Russia would totally spin that as 'they're attacking us' and then we'd for sure see a more 'nuclear' response from Russia which most likely would involve the US moreso than they are now.
That’s fair.
I don’t mind who does the accounting here, as long as it’s accurate, transparent, and quick.
A running total for Putin and the rest of the world to see: “we’re keeping track, and we’re not going to forget.”.
