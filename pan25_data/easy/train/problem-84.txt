3reich Germany didn't start with "jews in auschwitz" either.

Oh and btw, as pointed out the other day ( ), US prisons in louisiana still resell the prisonners in slavery (they even sell unconvicted pre trial suspects that would have a bail in another state; they set it purposely too high like 5 millions then they can sell you off to some business as a "leased convict" as you can't afford to bail yourself out even with a bondsman); using the loophole in the XIII amendment, since it's yet another thing the GOP Is exploiting and the white house won't lift a finger upon.
