Such BS.
Biden and Congress screwed over RR workers to save the economy only to wreck the economy over one guy who is speaker of the house.
Thousands forced to sacrifice for the greater good while a single individual whose job it is to ensure the common good (also known as governance) will wreck it rather than sacrifice himself.
What a terrible corrupt coward.
Shame, sbame, shame on that RR deal too.
r/politics is currently accepting new moderator applications.
If you want to help make this community a better place, consider !
Because they have successfully indoctrinated their base to believe that everything bad is someone else's fault, and the donors owners of the Republican party also happen to own the major media outlets; the very same outlets who consistently and all too frequently put the onus for every single fucking thing going on in American politics on the Democrats even -- and especially -- when it's the Republicans actually causing problems.
Not sure that would be a good look for potus.
Since the entire world would be impacted by the US defaulting I expect other nations are watching.
Also there is the big picture to consider, history won't be kind to the GOP.
It won't be kind to Biden either if he doesn't try everything within his power to prevent it and we default, leading to "calamity".
Biden certainly realizes this.
In general, be courteous to others.
