Puerto Rico is also a defined piece of land - it is an island.
The borders of the British Mandate were drawn 20 years before 1948 after the British eviscerated the old Ottoman vilayet borders.
There is and was zero basis for Arabs to claim these recently and arbitrarily made borders as their own, despite the fact that these borders contained a significant ethnic minority that had zero wish to be part of an Arab state.
