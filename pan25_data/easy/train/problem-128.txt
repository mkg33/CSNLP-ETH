I have a vivid memory of that day.
I was released from the acute mental ward and that was what was on the TV while I waited for my hubby to get me.
It was obvious he was trying to help that child.
But he was an ape and couldn't know he was drowning him instead.
I cried when they killed him.
Canada and US both jointly "supported" the creation of NORAD, it actually stands for, "North American Aerospace Defense Command", and there are Canadian military advisors there(or who answer about the officers there), so NORAD is mostly in United States but it's sorta of a joint venture.
Yup.
Sounds about right.
- But for political purposes, unless there's an immediate threat, I'd like to see some other countries to get some skin in the game.

Probably.
It would just be nice to have seen Canada take it out, so it doesn't appear that's it's just the US going all out on the balloon popping game.
