This meant folks that work for a high-paying company in California or New York would then move to a rural/sparsely populated state like Iowa to live and maximize their income.

The same can be applied to other areas, sadly.
Biggest European companies include things like Nestle (yes, terrible, but European), Glencore, Airbus, Siemens, Philips, Volkswagen, ArcelorMittal, Mercedes-benz, tons of games companies (like supercell, remedy, king etc) etc.

Plenty of reasons I find the idea of living in Europe pleasing, but doing so for financial reasons is simply silly.
