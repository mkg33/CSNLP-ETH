Every act of protest if it is to have any teeth is an implicit threat.
It says if things don't change according to the protestors' definition of better, then the next time things are going to be much less pleasant.
But blocking the road changes the target of that threat.
Instead of telling politicians and executives who have disproportionate power to individually influence climate policy to do better or else, it's telling average people living in cities designed around cars that that they personally need to end climate change tomorrow, or else the protestors will make their lives untenable.
Need to take an ambulance to the hospital for a health emergency?
You can die instead.
Need to get to work on time so you can pay rent and not end up homeless?
You can end up homeless instead.
The protestors don't care about you.
You personally fix climate change now or suffer the consequences of their protests.
Disagree.
While I donâ€™t disagree the painting thing is not effective, blocking traffic, if done in a collective way, could be very effective.
It effectively raises the cost of travel by automotive modes and as such, makes the economic calculus different.
