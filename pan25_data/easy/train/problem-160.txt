December 3, 1855 â€“ February 2, 1856: The election for Speaker of the House was the longest and most contentious Speaker election in its history, due to sectional conflict over slavery and a rising anti-immigrant mood in the nation that contributed to a poisoned and deteriorating political climate.
Further, no party had received a majority of the seats, while 21 members vied for the post of Speaker.
The election took 133 ballots and two months, with Nathaniel P. Banks winning over William Aiken Jr. by 103 to 100 votes.
Technically, 113 votes were required to secure a majority in the election for Speaker, but a change was made to the rules so that a winner to be declared with a plurality if, after three consecutive rounds of voting, no majority was achieved.
[1] Banks, a member of both the nativist Know-Nothing (American) Party and the Free Soil Party, served one term as Speaker before Democrats regained control of the chamber in the 35th Congress.

The GOP actually loves performative theatrics, it's how they get elected - going on Fox and OANN talk shows etc, they don't hold policy positions, they're elected based on the quality of their memes and cult propaganda.
Actually bringing legislation to the floor is just a distraction for them, and as long as they have no speaker, they don't need to bother with any of that governing crap which they intend not to do anyway.
They're only being hamstrung on doing normal government business until they have a speaker, and they actually haven't wanted to do normal government business in years, so there's little or no reason for them to resolve this.
