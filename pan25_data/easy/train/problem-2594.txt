Woke puts undue emphasis on the role and prevelance of racism.
Woke considers the plight of slaves to be ongoing through their descendants, with unaddressed wrongs persisting to this day.
Woke asserts that the only remedy for these wrongs are benefits targeted to racial minorities and, frequently, the deemphasis or suppression of what can be instead called the majority, and the majority is by some extension the oppressor.
Woke doesn't stop with race, though.
It also readily takes up other "minorities" in other areas, such as gender expression.
You'll notice that the character of woke changed slightly when it was extended from a racial issue to one of gender.
Unfortunately, it has become sort of an amalgam of different oppressor/oppressed relationships, viewed specifically in the context of US domestic politics, so it might be better to view it as a framework with which to approach different ideas than an idea itself.
That isn't what the bill is.
This is more like if I choose to have my vasectomy reversed then the health insurance that covered it (if yours actually did) would have to also cover the reversal regardless of if im on.
A different plan now.
It's stupidity.
