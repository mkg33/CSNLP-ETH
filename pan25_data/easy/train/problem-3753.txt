The Russians brought the Arctic version of the Tor M2DT air defense system to the front, filmed a video and showed it on Zvezda TV.
And then a Ukrainian drone found it, and the 406th artillery brigade destroyed it.
Russia is literally experiencing the above situation.
They could bring up the men from all over Russia but they can't give them the level of support they had on day 1.
They have the resources to pump out cheap tanks but modern sophisticated ones are too expensive to build and will take too long.
Etc.
They're dirt cheap to mass produce and deploy.
Yet they cost a fortune to find and "safely" recover.
I say "safely" as even the real pros will still get injured or killed in cleaning up minefields.
It takes a long, long time to find and recover mines compared to the ease in which they are mass manufactured and deployed.
Interesting geopolitical move.
Is Netanyahu attempting to force Europeans to take a hard line against Iran vs their previous nuclear deal by using the Ukraine conflict?
