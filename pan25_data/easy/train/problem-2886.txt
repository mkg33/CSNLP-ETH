Even if you manage to get out (which is illegal, so you're now also officially a criminal WITH THE SAME POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES TO YOUR FAMILY as that 'other' relative who fled), unless you have well-connected relatives in the correct neighboring country, you're now an illegal immigrant with no status, no resources, and likely no marketable skills, ripe for exploitation.
They don't think they can.
They know they can and they did.
The West has had it's head so far up its ass concerning China for 20+ years due to greed.
China has always told the West who and what they are.
A "communist"/fascist human rights abusing country.
And they've never shown otherwise or a tendency that they would become Westernized.
They've been playing the West all along.
I mean sure itâ€™s not too far fetched that Officiald in China can threaten Chinese citizens through extortion for them to voluntarily return back to China, but actually snatching people up physically to smuggle them across the seas back to China feels a little bit hard to believe, most developed countries have pretty strong border protections, it would be extremely difficult, nigh impossible to smuggle people in suitcases and travel luggages through airport security without being detected by customs/border patrols or sniffer dogs.
