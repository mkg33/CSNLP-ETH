Example, my grandfather's squad in WW2 was under heavy Japanese fire, so he looks over, sees the body of a Lt. surrounded by several other corpses and he ordered for his men to pick them up and use the bodies as shields as they back up to regroup with the main army assuming they are dead and not wanting his men to take more injuries/casualties than necessary.
We don’t decide the country we are born in.
People shouldn’t have to give their lives for it if they aren’t comfortable with the decision or circumstances surrounding their possible demise, (like not retreating against overwhelming firepower.
).
In any case, it's usually a rule in most militaries that you are obligated under military law to obey a "lawful order", but likewise may be obligated to refuse an "unlawful order".
Did it ever happen?
No..not since the two World Wars.
Would it have happened.
Only in very particular dire circumstances.
That’s all nice to say when you have a full volunteer army.
A lot of these men are conscripts/draftees.
