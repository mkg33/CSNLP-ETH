There was an MP who was an open critic of legalising and decriminalising cannabis, whose husband owned is the managing director of one of the largest producers of medicinal cannabis in the country.
Omg the price.
But how did you even meet up with someone who would sell to you?
I use medicinally and want to travel to Japan so bad.
I’m terrified to try my luck.
I can’t speak to how things are today in 2023, but the people I know who’ve worked in Japan (both locals and foreigners) said that it was after work corporate socializing (not officially mandatory but actually mandatory) more than in office hours that often made their workdays so long: normal workday followed by 4 hours of dinner and drinking with colleagues.
Sure.
Basically I got very drunk at a bar I frequented and when going to the bathroom I accidentally stumbled into a storage room.
I stole a little nicknack like an asshole (I fully admit that I am the asshole through this whole story).
I walked out of the bar and ran into the owner who saw the thing and got pissed.
I gave it back to him and while he was talking to me a bar patron was calling the police, when I realized that I ran but again, I was wasted, and they followed me and pointed me out to the cops who took me to jail.
I spent the night getting like interrogated about it.
The detective doing the interrogating was an huge dick and asked me questions for hours about tons of shit.
Told me calling the embassy or consolute or whatever would make me have to stay longer because they wouldn’t come for a long time.
Asked me everything about my life and on and on.
I puked during the interrogation and was so drunk, they put me in a drunk tank like area.
The next morning they “officially” arrested me and took me to a detention center.
They take you out of holding and they chain you hand waist and ankles to the other inmates and you have to stand in a big line all cuffed together.
