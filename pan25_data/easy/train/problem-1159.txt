The plan was made to go to war, peace was never on the table.
Ukraine and its leadership planned their part in this conflict very carefully, their role is to play the victim.
Killing Russians in the east and waiting for Russia to cross borders so that they could use the victim card, they knew that Russia will enter their borders eventually between 2020-2022, and they knew that the UKR population was at risk, but they never told them what is about to happen because they needed victims of war, they needed men to fight, so they never publicly said anything so that no one leaves the country before the conflict starts.
The fact that all of this is known from statements of UKR officials like Arestovich and the like, but the stupid cheerleaders still deny it, says everything about the sheep in the western countries.
Keep founding the war you are the ''good guy'', you can sleep well at night.
At the request of Ukrainska Pravda to comment on the assessment voiced by von der Leyen in the first version of her appeal, Bohdan Senyk, the head of the Public Relations Department of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, noted that the General Staff could not confirm this figure, and the losses of the Ukrainian army are official information and fall under the restriction of disclosure.
