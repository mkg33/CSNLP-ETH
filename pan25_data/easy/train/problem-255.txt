I would not be so sure or use such a "confident" answer.
If you've been paying attention since at least 2016 then you should know republicans absolutely can't be trusted.
They're all absolutely loyal to the party, except a literal few which doesn't make a difference and is basically a rounding error.
And the party chose trump.
They loved trump.
They're actively rolling around in the shit he left behind and looking for someone to shit all over everything again.
The republican party is highly concerning and actively looking to undermine the US gov for greed.
Nothing has changed because trump lost.
And 70 something million still voted for trump after everything.
That's not a huge loss and shows how much support an actual wicked party has in the US.
Taiwan has strategic geographical importance.
China's navy can't really move out to the Pacific without being seen by the US.
If they controlled the ialand they could move in an out with less attention.
Even if the value of what the island produces goes down it is still a strategic target.
