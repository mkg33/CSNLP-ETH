Under the new contract they will get one day of sick leave and they are reducing penalties for taking their vacation time on short notice, that will reduce the number of people going to work sick.
So, safer than we were before the contract, but otherwise yes you have a good point, people absolutely shouldn't be forced to work while they are sick, and hopefully in the future congress can pass a bill guaranteeing sick leave.
However, in the short-term I believe the country as a whole would be worse off if their were a rail strike.
40% of our shipping goes by rail, what happens to our economy if that stops?
How much do the already high price of goods increase?
How many kids go hungry?
I give 0 f's about the GOP this was passed 80 to 15 which obviously includes Democrats and all you neoliberal centrists democrats who claimed that they split the bill and would also pass the sick leave part when everyone knew that point of the splitting of the bill was to screw them on the sick leave are 100 PERCENT the pivotal key problem.
