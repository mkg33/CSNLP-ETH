While the rest of the GOP makes it harder to vote, attacks everyone that isn't a rich white evangelical, outright says they're going to eliminate basic human rights after saying it should be a state issue, were very vocal about being pro-child rape and forced birth.
They're banning books and trying to further demarginalize groups that are contrary to their beliefs despite making up such a small portion of the population - while the party itself is jammed full of pedophiles and criminals, are they demonized by the party?
FUCK NO, they're celebrated.
Not to mention supporting some of the stupidest, openly racist, homophobic, and anti democracy candidates I think we have ever seen in the last 60 years.

Exactly.
Republicans actively support positions that destabilize the United States by any measure of progress or efficiency.
They don’t care about results, they care about power (for themselves, for their rich donors).
