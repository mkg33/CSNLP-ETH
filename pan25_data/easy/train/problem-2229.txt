Bullshit.
Do not give these guys credit where it is not to.
Everyone knows that Israel has the full backing of the United States.
This is some shit that I'm saying they're worried about their security situation.
If they're so worried about their security situation, either way, maybe we should stop sending tons of funding their way.
If it apparently isn't helping them feel secure.
Ukraine never supported Israel.
Ukraine votes against Israel at the UN all the time.
How can I be an appeaser if I'm saying NATO should send more money and weapons to Ukraine?
Your insults don't even make sense.
Well most foreign fighters would be fighting for ideological ( democracy, anti authoritarianism etc) reasons.
Ho come on.
The security relations literally means they don't stop Israel from attacking Iran in syria, and not selling them some advanced weapons systems.
The russians siding with Iran on this would mean either mean direct fighting between Israel and russia, or Israel being forced to attack shipments in Lebanon itself (which means war with Hezbollah).
Israel providing weapons to ukraine would be a huge escalation of the war, which would make it a middle eastern one as well.
