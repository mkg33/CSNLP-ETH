So basically your problems all stem from people not being able to OPENLY hate others in public (because other than hate and inflicting cruelty on others, what free speech has been restricted?)
and people taking issue with a bunch of idiots who think vaccines are poison and who, and I can’t stress this enough, occupied the capital for WEEKS because they wanted Canada to lift the mandates (which still wouldn’t have helped their chief mandate related concern about getting into the USA, which had mandates of it’s own in place also).
Hard pressed?
You’d have no chance.
If you take the military forces located in Texas OR California they could establish military superiority over Canada without help from another state….
For me?
Fear of the unknown.
I’d have to find a place to live that works for my family, my wife and I would both need new jobs, and while my daughter says she likes the idea of moving to Canada, I know full well she’d miss her friends and be miserable.
We would also miss our friends as well.
