“The world’s most-watched sporting competition this year will not be a feel-good affair.
FIFA, soccer’s corrupt governing body, awarded the 2022 edition of the World Cup to Qatar via bribery.
The teams, players, and fans of the game must now grapple with the complexities of an ethically fraught, morally bankrupt tournament already soaked in blood and oil– a sportswashed public relations exercise for Qatar that has cost an untold amount of migrant workers their lives since the announcement was made.”.
This is exactly it.
I live in India and hate the fact we are buying oil from Russia but I see that we are getting cheap oil.
The US always watches our for its own interests and maybe we should be doing it too.
FIFA is a horrific organization obviously only caring about money.
I couldn't live with myself if I was organizing an event in a country where I knew slave labor would be killed in the process of hosting it.
And why?
I don't know how much the "incentives" were, but it wasn't enough to make any real difference to the lives of the people who took it, except to douse their hands in blood.
