Odd way of saying I canâ€™t be bothered to Google and anyone arguing with me must be demanded to provide you with links to source material.
After all, we all know whenever such material is provided the person subsequently goes and reads it then comes back and humbly agrees.
No one ever returns with the most nitpicking arguments in order to discredit evidence provided.
Never!
Still, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, "The data show that for every 8.3 executions carried out in the United States, a wrongfully condemned death-row prisoner is exonerated."
Their research and data on the subject starts following the Supreme Court case Furman v. Georgia in 1972.
Their findings doesn't include several scenarios of innocence and is again plagued by the fact that more could be innocent but it just hasn't been proven yet.
Perhaps must damning of all is the fact that the majority of these cases are brought about due to official misconduct or perjury.
I highly recommend reading through their findings as it does have nuance and particulars that are hard to convey or mention here.
