No it’s about maintaining the rules everyone has agreed to previously which benefits all countries.
Who cares if there’s a warship 12 miles off your coast?
Russia does it to the US and we just watch them.
Russian subs and their aircraft carrier transit the Uk-Iceland-Greenland gap and their military just observes.
You should be happy those rules exist but China laying claim in the middle of the South China Sea goes against that and the freedom you aren’t aware you enjoy.
What if China wasn’t challenged and they closed “their sea” to trade unless a fee was collected?
The route around India through the South China Sea is one of the most important trade routes in the World.
Remember what happened when the Suez was blocked for a few weeks?
Prices shot up because shipping had to wait or go the extremely long and dangerous way around the Horn of Africa.
Oh and then India completely stopped shipping to pass through the Bay of Bengal in order to squeeze China, and they most definitely can with their Navy before considering regional partners like Australia who is due to get some fancy new submarines.
It's not.
I think the Swedes have done that to the US so many times we basically rented part of their military so we could try and find them in drills... And we never did.
Sub tech is wild.
