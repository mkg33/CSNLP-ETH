I didn’t say that they were practicing 21st century western values lol.
All of them were pretty discriminatory and barbaric by our values.
None of the major religions treated apostates well AT ALL.
That was a death sentence from India to England.

Frankly many of the empires and Emirates liked having a large christian populace because they paid the Jizya.
Greece, most of the Balkans, the Iberian Peninsula were under Muslim rules for hundreds of years and stayed majority Christian.
They viewed them as people of the book.
The Christians weren’t nearly as open minded when they conquered or reconquered muslim land and viewed them as devil worshipers or similar.
Exactly.

No matter what your feelings on the conflict, getting mad because a guy dared to walk near a mosque for 15 minutes is pretty ridiculous.
