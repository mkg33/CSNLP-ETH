In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

The Dems on the other hand are the "big tent party".
That's both the strenh and weakness of each party.
It is objectively true that neoliberal/corporatist democrats favor right-wing economic policies.

It is literally impossible to understand this political moment without understanding that neoliberal/corporatist Dems are actually right-wing, even if the other major alternative is even more right-wing.
