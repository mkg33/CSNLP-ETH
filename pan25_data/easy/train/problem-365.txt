In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Exactly.
And care for chronic conditions is even worse, and probably more important.
Everything is handled through "the clinic" or your GP.
And lots of people just don't get even that because they can't afford it, but they don't really understand that if they did get care, it would help.
Like, they just dismiss the idea of seeing a PT as impossible (both because there aren't enough in the county and they can't afford it) but they also don't really believe it would help.
The pain they are living with is seen as an immutable fact of life, part of growing old.
Replace "PT" with "regular visits with endocrinologist for diabetes care" or "visits to the cardiologist to identify why walking across a parking lot is getting harder" or whatever and you get a bunch of people who see quality health care as like, non-essential.
