Brazil has been shady before with its nuclear enrichment tech and at the time the US and the IAEA were kind of pissed about panels blocking the view of part of the equipment during inspections.

It's very insensitive to traditional Brazilian allies and trade partners, but its very consistent with their historical position of not taking a stand about any international issue unless forced to by the circumstances (like a actual war between Iran and Israel and USA).
Dude did you read what I said?
Democratically elected congress members are allowed to impeach a president, no matter the reason... Maybe it was unfair, or not enough reasons to such a drastic thing in your opinion, but it still was done by elected oficials, so you can't say its a coup...
You know, when the congress that was democraticly elected votes to impeach a president, its not a coup, even if you think the reasons of said impeachment are fake or weak, thats how democracy works, we should just accept even if we think it was unfair or stolen, just as trump and republicans should've accepted they lost...
Yeah which is a shady way to make it constitutional, I'm not disagreeing on that, I'm disagreeing on calling it a coup, for it to be a coup you will need to change the constitution so to make it not possible to change something from legal to ilegal like that again to abbuse the ''crime de responsabilidade'', which is something I would support, but I still think presidents should be able to be impeached at any time if there is enough votes for it, thats how the most stable democracies work.
It's useful in many ways.
If one of those ways happens to be as a weapon so be it.
Maybe don't have an economy that imports 5 times as much as it exports.
Keep in mind that Brazil imports 5 times as much as it exports.
And the US can and will intercept Iranian vessels under sanction.
