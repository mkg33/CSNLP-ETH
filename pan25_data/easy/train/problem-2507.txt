Unless he really is so unhinged that all along he’s been planning an apocalyptic finale to his fiasco (because there is no winning this for the Kremlin), he either didn’t listen to good intelligence (not likely) or he got bad intelligence (seemingly more likely than not).
No.
The current situation is pretty much ideal from a strategic standpoint, especially if one is a defense company or a governmental official in part funded by contributions from such companies.
NATO is draining down Russia's military, the technical talent in Russia is leaving for other countries (I expect, to countries friendly to the west, or actually to NATO countries), and Russia's ability to rebuild is being greatly impaired.
Among other things.
All at the cost of some equipment (much of it slated for retirement) and aging munitions.
Russia's general attitude is bound to support NATO countries in rebuilding their militaries, possibly expanding them, and continuing to follow the them v. us "stalemate" of the cold war.
NATO countries get the "benefits" of a wartime economy, without the necessity of actually having troops in action.
The situation is a fake non-war.
It's war - economic blockade, ground forces committed, logistics strained, mass civilian deaths, deportations from the occupied territories.
