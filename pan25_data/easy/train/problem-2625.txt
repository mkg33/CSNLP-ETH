They're already banned here in Greece.
The high school I went to actually didn't allow them at all, though it didn't stop us from hiding them in our bags.
Totally.
I remember desperately trying to stay awake during college lectures by taking notes on everything the Prof said (the most boring lecturer, EVER.
I can still remember his drone...).
And that was college.
HS was worse.
Completely agree.
Kids/teens with smartphones nowadays are like Pavlov's dog, but instead of the bell ringing it is just whenever their phone dings/vibrates/makes a notification sound.
And the extremely short attention spans are very worrying...
Exactly.
It distracts the kids, most of them are on the phones and sure as hell aren’t looking at what they’re being taught.
It’s not a wonder these kids from middle school on up to college don’t know simple questions of basic information in math, history and science.
There is no reason for it.
That being said, a decree from the Education Minister describing cellphones as "lacking respect to teachers" and "authority (not a well-rounded education, or even high literacy rates) must be restored as a priority," is on a whole different level.
I only thought of texting during class as a sign of boredom and inattention: not a "lack of respect for authority.
".
