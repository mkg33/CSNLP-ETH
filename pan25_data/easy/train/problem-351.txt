I was reading that at least one of these shootdowns (I think the Alaska one?)
correlates with the approximate location of an amateur balloon.
These things are a lot larger than party balloons but the actual amount of material in them is tiny, and the payload is just a tiny computer with a small radio and solar panels.
Finding light-colored shreds of balloon on ice and a Gameboy's worth of electronics in an area many miles wide is gonna be pretty difficult as compared to a whole-ass submarine.
If the stuff dropped in water it's gonna be even harder.
Whatever it is, extraterrestrial/China/secret government project/whatever, they are clearly hiding whatever it actually was.
I agree.
Think of a civilization slightly more advanced than ours.
Maybe they can see the world is habitable but don't know what's on it.
So you send your fast rocket ship (that object that was confirmed from coming from outside our solar system and then accelerating away.
You drop off some probes to explore and send info back.
The probes wouldn't have to be that complex.
In fact I'd argue they'd look a lot like what's been reported.
