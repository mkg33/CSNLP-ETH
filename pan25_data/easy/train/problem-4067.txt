Republicans are violent enemies of democracy.
DeSantis is attacking education and equality - and the media are desperate to keep people ignorant and apathetic.
Defy them - unite, organizer and mobilize - defend democracy.
Ugh.
I definitely feel for you.
My family is blah with politics, meaning they don’t at all immerse themselves in the information that’s available on candidates, political parties, legislation, etc yet still bolster the Republican Party.
It’s disgusting.
Whenever I tell my mother about anything, she’s just like “well I don’t know anything about that”, yet still feels entitled to an opinion ahahahha she actually told me during the mid term elections that she wanted the republicans to gain majority in house and senate, and when I asked her why, she just said “I just do.” I had to explain to her that all the benefits my family gets, disability, social security, food stamps, state mandated health care, etc will be drastically cut if republicans wind up having a much larger presence.
