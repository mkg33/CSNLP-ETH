The context here, though, is meat processing and no way should a 14 year old be anywhere near that kind of environment.
And for what it’s worth, I don’t think a 14 year old should work in construction broadly either.
I helped with kitchens and bathrooms and was watched after in the way family and friends would do.
Later when I worked framing and trimming and tree service on HS and college breaks, I saw all manner of unsafe stuff.
OSHA or state regs are not enough to keep people from harm, and it’s not fair to expect minors to self-advocate against profit-driven business owners where their peers can be in large part migrant adults.
That is absolutely ridiculous!
It's bad enough that so many adult workers are struggling to make ends meet, and now you want to take advantage of kids too?
These companies already exploit their workers, this would just be an even bigger slap in the face.
I know for a fact that there are plenty of college students and other adults who need these jobs, why not let them have it?
