It's not an issue the politicians actually care about, but it is one they think they can use to rally voters to support something they don't realize they are supporting.
In that case, voters think they are saving babies for Jesus or whatever when really, they are voting to challenge the 14th Amendment and roll back Civil Rights.
In this case, voters think they are saving the Levant for Jesus or whatever when really, they are voting to line the pockets of cronies in the military-industrial complex and the oil industry.
In both cases, politicians tried a couple different angles before finding something that stuck.
Palestinian land?
beside the non Palestinian land that persisted throughout history with Jewish villages?
those who got repeatedly massacred in the 1920s to make them run away?
They probably wouldn't give citizenship to Palestinian citizens.
They'd give full rights to Israeli citizens, some rights to Arabs, and no rights for other Arab groups.
You misunderstand their relationship.
Israel (fictional country) does not have anywhere near the political capital to have anyone by the nuts.
