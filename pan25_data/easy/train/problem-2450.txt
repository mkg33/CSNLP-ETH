Like I get that he’s incredibly privileged and I get that so many people are against the monarchy.
But he’s cutting down drastically on costs and taking pretty big steps (for an ancient entrenched institution) in the correct direction.
Receives nothing but shit for it.
He's always been about environmental preservation.
I was very lucky to once meet him in my hometown about 20 years ago alongside Camilla.
They were there looking at development proposals for the region at this awkwardly tiny "convention" and he spent an enormous amount of time talking to someone about a prototype house design that used this special film over its windows that essentially were solar panels but also heavily insulated (UK housing is awfully insulated) and then he spent a long time talking to someone who was working on a "low water" farming solution that would promote allotment style farming for people to reduce pollution too.
100% true.
Those ducks/geese live like royalty compared to most other livestock.
It’s insane that people chose foie gras as a product to demonize when standard chicken is a million times worse.
Low hanging fruit I guess….
