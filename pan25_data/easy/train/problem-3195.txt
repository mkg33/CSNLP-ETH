I don't disagree that mainstream Christianity (and its precursor Judaism) are rooted in authoritarianism.
But there are interpretations of Christianity that are anti-authoritarian (see: Gnostic Christianity).
And there are individual Christians who focus soley on Christ's teachings and ignore Paul and everyone else who built a bunch of rules and a church around a man commanding radical love and putting others needs above one's personal wealth.
Yep.
Growing up, I remember there being a distinct separation between Denver, Castle Rock, and the Springs.
Last time I was out there, it was one, unbroken suburb between all of it.
It was shocking.
That's why I'm differentiating between political groups with a religious bent and religious groups, even though religious groups are, as you're saying, inherently political.
I think its more important to secure the separation of church and state and go after political groups and churches that are dodging taxes while functioning as political groups than trying to prove to everyone that Christianity is inherently evil.
Also, it's in our interests to have the help of religious Christians in combating the spread of political Christian nationalism.
I'd rather not alienate every single Christian by making them think that secular society hates them and wants them all destroyed.
