Yes.

After the RBG mess, on the heels of grinding Obamas appointment to a halt, its just time to assume the GOP will already take any steps necessary.

There was once a time when SCOTUS confirmations were unanimous or nearly unanimous: O'Connor was 99-0, Scalia 98-0, Kennedy 97-0 (after Bork's rejection), Ginsburg 96-3 and Breyer 87-9 (after Thomas' confirmation 52-48), and even Roberts' confirmation 78-22.
This.
And not only the District Court vacancies in the blue and purple states, but also the red states.
Dems have focused on appointing District Court judges in easy-to-fill blue states so far because the GQP can block red state nominees by abusing the blue slip, which requires both Senators from the state to agree on a judicial nominee.
As you can expect this intransigence to continue, Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin needs to consider abolishing blue slips for District Court nominees and pack the red state courts with Democratic judges.
Considering the lawlessness and corruption of Trump appointees (just look at his appointees at the 5th Circuit!
), these worthless hacks need to be put in the minority to stop them from fucking up the judicial branch even more.
