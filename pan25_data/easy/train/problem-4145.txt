Would they concentrate their forces differently - UAF response would've been different as well.
And, since the main assumption before the invasion was that there would be no prolonged opposition - it's hard to imagine in what scenario RuAF would be able to reach Kyiv with enough supply capabilities to level the city.

It wasn't meant as plainly as you say it.
Tyson implied talking shit and saying you're going to win and the game plan is unbreakable goes out the window as soon as you start getting your ass kicked.
He didn't mean just getting punched.
The cities leadership effectively jumped ship and sold out the city and its people to the Russians, there was skirmishes with Ukrainian forces around Kherson but it was clear that whoever was left to lead the city were clearly Russian loyalists, or at least tried to save their own skin by not cooperating with and helping the army.
...how?
This sounds fantastic until you remember the 70km long traffic jam.
Cramming even more forces on clogged roads with no chance of logistical support and attempting a protracted stalingrad style seige makes sense to you... how exactly?
