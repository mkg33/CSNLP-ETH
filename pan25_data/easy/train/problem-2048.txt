The issue here is that they may have been exposed doing \exactly\ the thing Russia has been accusing them of i.e.
using the fog of war to blame Russia for things that Russia didn't do in the hope that NATO get more involved as a consequence.
It's a dangerous miss-step to speak so brazenly before the facts came out.
I remind you that this is a situation where both sides seem to be accusing the other of bombing a Nuclear power plant, killing civilians and POW's, planning on blowing up a dam and planning to detonate a dirty bomb.
The veneer of credibility is important to Ukraine.
Lying, distorting and obscuring facts is Russia's wheelhouse and the more uncertainty there is about what is happening on the ground the more bandwidth Russia have to do whatever they want.
It matters where the actual missile came from and it matters that Ukraine basically lied about it being Russian.
The things the president of a country say matter.
Zelensky?
In no time i saw some posts on reddit saying that us intelligence knew it was a Russian rocket.
Exactly.
They basically tried to leverage the deaths of 2 innocent people to make political capital before any facts were known.
