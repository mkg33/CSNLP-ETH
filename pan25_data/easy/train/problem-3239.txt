Covid is spread through the air, and hazmat suits create a more effective air barrier compared to masks, especially when you’re in a contained environment for a long time like on a flight.
You think hazmat suits are purely to prevent skin contact?
You’re wrong.
A friend of mine just caught Covid last weekend on a 2 hour flight to NYC.
She was wearing a mask, but was on a plane full of people not wearing masks, and the guy next to her was coughing his guts out while not wearing a mask.
Masks are helpful, but they’re not perfect, especially when no one else around is wearing one.
Had she been in a hazmat suit, her chances of catching Covid would have been significantly reduced.

How has the covid vaccination campaign gone in Japan?
Do you have access to the mRNA vaccines?
What was public response to getting vaccinated?
Thanks in advance.
Asking what doctors should do is irrelevant to my point, but it is not treated the same way as flu, drugs have been developed specifically for covid, it can linger longer, and there can be much more severe and longer term effects so people should take it more seriously even when self isolating.
Depending on severity treatment options differ greatly.
