It’s ironic that in some areas they lost by a margin slimmer than the number of elderly voters killed by COVID.
It would be funny if it wasn’t so dark.
Here they thought limiting early voting, mail voting and "harvesting" was their best option, regardless of the consequences for anyone else or the country itself, but that didn't work so now they're scrambling to undo it all because it was only ever about manipulating the election result.
"Donnie take me down town I'll get you Cullvers!"
"Grandma what the heck?".
"How did you get here?"
"How do you know where I live?"

You don't have to vote.
You just feel a social pressure.
You've never done anything because of a social pressure?
Fill out a survey, listen to a sales pitch a few minutes longer than you would have, ect.?
Also, it's weird because voting patterns have patterns to them and you can reliably sway the ballots you pick up to favor one side over the other.
It's not going to be 100%-0%, but it's pretty significant.
I just don't like the idea when people could just mail it or you could let someone they know hand it in.
Why allow a stranger in the mix?
