Gee.
I wonder why?
Couldn't be that you don't want to answer questions about the war you started, or the tens of thousands of Russians you already got killed?
Or the fact you're losing?
Of course I want NATO and the US to supply Ukraine with even more and it is frustrating to see them refuse to supply long range munitions while my relatives have to hide in the basement from missile strikes, but I'm also grateful that NATO and other nations have provided so much and continue to assert their support for Ukraine.
If support was not provided - both when the war started in 2014 and when it escalated in 2022 - I know that people would have still fought against Russia but it would have been even more brutal and difficult for the people to stand against Russian imperialism.
Undeniably so.
During his declaration of war special military operation speech back in February, the guy openly said that Lenin and Stalin made mistakes and that many countries came into existence in 1917 which never should have been allowed to do so, due to a lack of precedent for independence.
And obviously who better to reestablish the union than Daddy Putin?
Here's epicaricacy.
It's a nice English word you can use instead of that silly Teutonic schadenfreude.
