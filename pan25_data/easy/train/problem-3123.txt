I’m more curious how she’ll get on the ballot as an independent in Arizona.
In order to get on the ballot you need to pass around petitions.
Who is going to pass around her petitions after she burned everybody?
And then who is going to want to sign them petitions?
I remember hearing how people in her circle were saying she thinks she’s the smartest person in the room and thinks she’s good enough to be elected president.
I just feel like it shouldn’t be too surprising if she has lots of trouble with her campaign come 2024 because she doesn’t have the state party helping her among other things.
Running for statewide office isn’t some cakewalk even for incumbents let alone one that burned a lot of bridges.

Republicans, Democrats, Independents, whites, blacks, hispanics, college grads, non college grads, junkies, first graders, and puppies all cannot stand her.
