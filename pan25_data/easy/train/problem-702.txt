If only life were filled with so many black and white scenarios.
I'm not going to defend the fucked up way in which the modern Jewish state of Israel was created, the aftermath it has caused or the atrocious behaviour on both sides that still persists to this day... but claiming Jews only arrived in the area 10-20 years before Israel was created is just moronic.
Specifically Uganda.
The modern founder of Zionism proposed the idea.
But it was highly resisted amongst Russian Jewish leaders and never came to fruition.
If it did pass, there would be no Israel-Palestine issue.
But there would most likely be an Israel-Uganda issue.
Zionism - exactly.
Zionism, the understanding that there is no cure for antisemitism and that only by establishing a state for Jews - not even necessarily in Eretz Yisrael, but only by establishing a Jewish state, the nations of the world will learn to treat the Jews as equals.
Enlightenment and Jewish assimilation unfortunately didn't suppress antisemitic sentiments, but arguably worsened them, because now Jews were seen as direct competitors in society.
