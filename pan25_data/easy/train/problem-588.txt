Mechanically not any more difficult than the Mig-29 or Su-27 that the Ukrainian Air Force already operates.
I don't know why people act like the UAF is flying biplanes around.
They operate a fleet of modern jets.
My money is on Russia trying to hunker down for the winter, being mercilessly hounded by Ukrainian artillery and snipers, starving and without electricity, terrified of lighting fires, and looking for every possible opportunity to desert or mutiny.
Wow dude.
I was in the US Army for 10 years.
Despite having coats, it’s still cold as fuck and when you actually are outside with no shower living in a freezing cold tent for months on end, things get weird.
People still have to piss and stuff outside and take their clothes off.
Definitely the most battle-hardened.
Training wise they will probably be on-par with the other NATO countries, but honestly equipment-wise they still don’t have any western MBTs and no modern Air Force or Navy to speak of, they (absolutely heroically) make due with a few dozen MLRS and western artillery, some air defense and smaller systems.
You know the HIM in HIMARS?
It stands for High Mobility.
So even if Russian counter-battery wasn't complete shit, even if Russian radar operators weren't drunk and barely able to read their antiquated monitors, even if the few artillery batteries they have left weren't warped to hell and firing munitions loaded with duds - it still wouldn't matter.
Ukraine can fire off a (highly effective) barrage and be gone from the area before Ivan can seal his vodka bottle.
