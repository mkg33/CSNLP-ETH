Mueller did such an absolute shit job on that investigation.
I mean seriously...one of his top dogs was colluding with Russia lol.
JFC what a disaster inside job that was.
In addition, Giuliani explicitly claimed to be getting confidential information from the NY FBI outside of official channels.
Who knows?
FWIW, a quick google search makes it look like the oligarch in question (Deripaska) formally had a business relationship with Christopher Steele (the main person behind the Steele dossier that played a big role in the Trump-Russia investigation).
Also, a quick google search says that the Russian oligarch McGonigal was working with here (Deripaska) had previously worked with Christopher Steele, the individual behind the infamous Steele dossier that was a foundational part of the investigation of Trump-Russian collusion accusations.
5 month gap in work history?
Yea..... About that...
Thank you for your application but you're unsuitable for this level of work.
McGonigal didn't lead the investigation.
Nobody that knows what they are talking about claims that he did.
I went into some details , if you are interested.
