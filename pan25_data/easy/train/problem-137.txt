And to conclude, the "safe routes" and resettlement programs only cover a handful of countries.
Have you watched the video I posted?
The committee member asks Braverman how a person from an African country, persecuted at home, could come and make an asylum claim in the UK without having to board one of your "little boats" and avoid arriving in the UK "illegally".
You haven't responded to that.
Do you have no answer, and therefore admit that for a large number of countries, there are NO safe and "legal" way to arrive in the UK?
And therefore people MUST board your "little boats"?
Germany does allow dual citizenship for EU citizens.
It is relevant to a British citizen in the context of this discussion because the UK was an EU member until 3 years ago.
So a British citizen who had already lived for 10+ years in Germany in 2022/2023 had the opportunity to become a German citizen before the UK left, without giving up their British citizenship, and they simply decided not to do so.
I know it depends on the country, but we are talking about Germany, which allows dual nationality with other EU countries (and the UK was a member all those years), and the UK which allows dual nationality with any country.
