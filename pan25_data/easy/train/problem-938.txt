That’s some of the most selfish shit I’ve seen.
I have no student debt.
I still think that predatory student loans need to be forgiven just like any other loan is forgiven when demonstrated to be predatory.
I don’t need to directly benefit from a fucking program to think it’s a good idea.
It just blows my goddamned mind.
Also, car loans are securitized by the car you take plus they run a credit check to determine if it’s a good risk whereas student loans are given out without looking if it can be paid back and generally are directed to young people which this is their first foray into the S&L market.
So?
Congress wrote and passed the bill establishing PPP loans and clearly authorized them to be forgiven.
Congress didn't write and pass a bill this session to grant authority for the broad student loan forgiveness Biden is trying to do.
So, the question remains whether he has the authority he claims from a 2003 bill meant for wartime emergencies.
Hopefully the courts take it up and settle the question of whether it's authorized or executive overreach.
