Absolutely true.
People are seriously mistaken if they think the doctor down the street who makes $800,000 a year is not paying taxes, after they read a report that Elon Musk or Bezos paid no taxes last year.
Those two filers are not at all the same, and hitting up the doctor for a greater percent of his income in taxes will do nothing to make the billionaire class pay a single cent of taxes.
The problems with the tax code are deep and structural, and increasing top marginal rates won’t fix those problems.
You could make the top marginal rate start at $100,000 a year and capture 100% of income earned above that, and billionaires could happily continue to pay absolutely nothing.
Seriously lol.
It’s been widely known for a long time that the government provides tax incentives for people to invest in certain areas and industries.
