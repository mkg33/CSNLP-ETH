That's because he's greedy, and insane.
They say he's supposed to be smart.
If that was true, why is his country so shitty?
Here's hoping his own people get sick of and get rid of him, soon.
I'm Estonian.
I have an entire fucking skeleton to pick with Russia and Russians, but I'm also realistic, because this is just history repeating.
I have one agenda.
To find the scarce matches that are being lit, and bring firewood.
They can't do this alone.
History, geography, government, and human nature are all playing against it.
I may be a sour bastard, but for the sake of Ukraine, and my own country's future, I just have to remain a bit idealistic.
We live in a globalised world.
Russia isn't just Russia's and Ukraine's problem anymore, or Eastern Europe's problem, or America's problem.
We're an interconnected wet rock now, all of us countries.
Russia is everybody's problem.
So whilst Russians themselves need to show initiative, if we want peace and prosperity, we have to work for it, too.
Because pointing fingers and screaming "well they are at fault so they alone must fix it" is satisfying and all, but where I'm from, it's also the mindset for people for whom war and occupation and conquest at this point are abstracts found in history books.
You want to be free and prosperous?
Earn it.
Find resisting elements and lend your shoulder.
Fun fact: in Russian "flower protests" would literally translate very similarly to "color protests" or "color revolutions", the boogeyman term used by the Kremlin and some other authoritarians around the world that in their parlance means a "peaceful or not so peaceful 'democratic' revolution for US/West to destroy the country('s sovereignty and culture)".
