Right, if only Joe Biden had stepped in and blocked all those CEOs of all those global companies from shutting down their supply chains in anticipation of no one buying anything during COVID...oh, and override Xi's lockdowns that was grinding the Chinese economy to a halt where the world gets all it's foods processed and goods from...oh, and stopped Putin before he went to war with Ukraine that impacted global wheat and grain prices, and stopped the Saudis from raising the price of oil at the same time causing global oil prices to rise and in turn giving US oil companies an excuse to jack up gas prices making the cost of goods more expensive...actually, come to think of it, its all Hillary's fault for not beating Trump and therefore doing a far better job of managing the impact of COVID and not attacking trade agreements and putting tariffs on China that, you guessed it, jacked up prices on everything...is anyone paying attention anymore?
They totally can.
I mean...it's a reality that is happening.
The trick is that they don't need to prove it to anyone - if they just scream it enough it becomes as much truth as anything else they fabricate.
