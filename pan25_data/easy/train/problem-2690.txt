No.
You are not the arbiter of laws and guns and rights.
You've demonstrated your opinion on this topic is entirely invalid and uesless.
You're literally saying "Let's ignore the actual constitution and law and all of legal history and precedent and instead make up new laws and interpretations to suit my personal interpretation and desires.

There are so many better options with bipartisan appeal like universal background checks and thorough licensure and training requirements to pursue before passing an extremely unpopular gun ban that accounts for, at most, 1-3% of annual gun violence and will practically accomplish nothing whatsoever other than losing future elections for Democrats.
Why is that sad?
At that point 20 million of something that murders 36 people in mass shootings in a nation of over 330 million people is hardly a threat to civilization and is obviously used by and large peacefully and legally by well over 99.9% of the people who own them.
20 million guns and those guns were responsible for a total of 36 deaths in the year so far in a nation of 330 million people.
