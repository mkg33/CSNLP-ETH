Stuff like this is where you see the GOP's real priorities.
Their plan is to abolish income tax and the IRS and replace it with a consumption tax.
The outcome of that would be effectively a massive increase in tax on the poorest people who spend their entire income every month, and a massive break for the wealthy who actually spend a very small percentage of what they make.
So a multi-millionaire would probably end up not paying a great deal more in taxes than someone working at McDonald's.
They would of course still pay more, but the actual percentage of their income going towards that would be laughably trivial, and they wouldn't have to worry about capital gains, estate tax, or any other taxes.

Crushing the poors is the point of the "fair" consumption tax.
It is intended to shift the tax burden entirely to the poor, while making it statistically irrelevant for the rich.
