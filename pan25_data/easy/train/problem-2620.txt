What nuance?
There is a quote literally from the governor's of the Sri Lankan central bank under 2 successive administration's that contradicts your claim of debt trapping and that the port was repayment for loans from China.
Both Sri Lankan central bank govenors from 2 gov administration's involved at the time of the port lease catgorically said the port was leased to gain funds to service more expensive non Chinese debt (IMF debt).
Firstly at the time of the port lease, Chinese loans there were not the biggest nor the most expensive and Hambantota port that everyone cite as repayment for a loan default isn't actually true.
They literally said Chinese loans weren't the biggest nor the most expensive (those were the IMF loans and Canadian advisers to the SL gov suggested to lease the port to relieve IMF DEBT) yet somehow you do the mental gymnastics that it is China debt traps.
Nope.
Colonialism ended 60 years ago and growth has been pretty much stagnant since then.
Which countries are doing "very well"...?
Botswana, maybe Equatorial Guinea, we're talking about a few small nations with resources that still have the majority of the populace living in severe poverty.
