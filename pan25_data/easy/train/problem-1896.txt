My neighbor is the kind of guy that proudly blamed China when his whole family got COVID.
He doesn't think he's racist at all but loves to joke about Asian massages (My wife is Korean).
These are the kind of people who voted for Walker.
His wife calls me one of the good liberals...so yea..I get it.
I dunno if they will as it may set a weird precedent, again, about Congress deciding stuff into the future, and there are situations where it can backfire from a purely practical standpoint: say they pass a bill rasing the ceiling and stipulating not to touch it until after next election cycle to "protect it" from fuckery, but something happens and US runs out of runway, at which point they may not be able to raise it even if they all agreed to, causing a shutdown and financial Armageddon as us defaults on it's debt obligation.
I love this.
I live in Arizona and there's a guy who drives around in a truck that's got NASA IS A HOAX and some other dumb shit painted on it; I'm sure he didn't vote for Kelly.
