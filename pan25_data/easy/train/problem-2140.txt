That's a deflection... Never excused traitors and i blame the current and past administration 100% for their action and inaction on what happened.
Again not hard to say, stop making this something it's not and excusing bad behavior.

To call an entire town being evacuated and a massive ecological disaster threatening to devastate many communities "manufactured outrage" has to be one of the most ridiculous takes I've seen on here.
All just to cover for Buttigieg's reputation too.
It's not his fault but this is an insulting comment to the people in Ohio.
Potentially.
Given that the same party that repealed train safety regulations that were supposed to prevent this sort of thing also fight against laws to reduce school shootings maybe neither are worth talking about anymore.
That said, I'm not sure if some people being asked to evacuate is quite the same as children being murdered.
