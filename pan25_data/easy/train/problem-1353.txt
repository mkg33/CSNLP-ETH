Firstly, context and nuance is important.
For instance, nowhere in the rest of the constitution do they spend a single word justifying what they specify.
They never say "excessive bail would like, be unfair to the poors, so let's not do that", they just come out and say "excessive bail will not be required".
So when they talk about a well regulated militia, you can't just ignore that part.
It is not okay to read it as "We think that a well regulated militia is totes cool, and needed for the security of a free State, which is just swell.
Now, where were we?
Oh yes The right to bear arms shall be inviolable" I mean, if that was actually the case, under no circumstances could we disarm anyone.
Prisoners, terrorists, active shooters, five year olds.
And that is just absurd.
Furthermore, California also banned the possession of previously grandfathered "large" (standard, i.e.
11+ rounds) capacity magazines although the possession ban (the "Yeah those magazines you previously registered and were allowed to keep?
You're not allowed to keep them anymore.
Turn them in."
part of the law) is still tied up in court.
