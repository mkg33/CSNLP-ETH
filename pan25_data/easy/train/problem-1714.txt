No one has that information except maybe the Kremlin (and given the way they are running the war I doubt even they have a clear picture), unless it is pieced together bit by bit by researchers and analysts.
Even in wars that are 50 years in the past, people are still unearthing new data about this or that aspect of the war that was previously unknown.
Like.. yes these events took place a while ago now, but war being a huge mess it can often be hard to tell what just happened, and it can take a while to do all the investigation and piece the whole story together.
