Also, typically at these level you do have debt.
Whether that is debt from school (my family friend and his wife have north of $200k in student loan debt, but that student loan debt allows them to make north of $400k a year.
That payment is $1800/month), mortgage debt (most well paying jobs are in cities where housing is expense and will run $3-5k per month), or raising children (one child in daycare can run $1500-1800/ month and is required when you have 2 high income earners).
Almost no one makes this level of salary without a graduate degree (or at minimum a bachelors degree).
The only place where where that is possible is tech who are currently getting destroyed by layoffs.
Tech is the outlier in the working world.
So while you think everything is peachy keen when you see $400k, you donâ€™t stop to think about all the additional expenses that come with that level.
Exactly.
They've been this way, and they like it.
They just don't like that it makes them lose when people get pissed off enough to tell them to shut up about their self serving backwardsness.
They aren't going to change, they're just going to maneuver.
