Yep.
If you look at this war like a mafia family (Russia) trying to eliminate/prevent any competition to their business ventures, it all makes a lot more sense.
It’s why Russia doesn’t care about how many of their, or Ukraine’s, citizens die.
They just care that no new competitors enter the market.
Yeah, Yeah, We all know that if Ukraine completely and unconditionally surrenders, Zelensky is removed, Formally give them all the annexed territory (Even the area's Russia has never had control over), demilitarize and basically just start kissing Putins Ass, The war would be over.
Why not both?
If it’s possible to use that money for that purpose then that’s great, but I imagine it will cost more to rebuild such a large portion of Ukraine and reparations should be a long term, ongoing punishment for Russia to deter any future aggression.
Cool.
Then it will be over when all Ukrainian territories are back under Ukrainian control, oppressors are forced out of the country and Russia begins paying reparations for the damage they have caused.
