Putin has convinced himself democracy itself is a failed ideology that every time it's been tried only results in fickle governments that can't get anything done over the long term until eventually their inherent weakness results in the people supporting or at least tacitly allowing a strongman to come to power, and he reckons he can bribe and manipulate any individual strongman that comes along.
In other words, he sees himself as the natural and superior end state of any democracy, and the natural leader of the authoritarian world that all democracies will inevitably evolve into.
That kind of megalomania must be an awesome drug, but it's gonna drive at least 2 countries into ruin.
Disagree.
A civil war of who against who?
No, the far more likely outcome is a coup.
Russians are very passive people.
They generally don't give a shit who is in charge as long as they have food and a place to live.
Some guy will take over, pull out of Ukraine, promise to fix shit, but will be just another oligarch who is taking his turn at the trough.
As long as there is food on the table, heat and shelter, Russians will let the government steal as much as they want.
This has always been the way things work.
