The Thwaites glacier is part of the western Antarctic ice sheet, the melting of which is one of the defined 'tipping points' in the climate system.
Because the ice sheet is separated from bedrock by a layer of warming seawater, once the melting starts, it will be very difficult to reverse.
In the short-term, the collapse of this glacier would decrease albedo and probably increase the melt-rate of the newly ocean-bound portion of the glacier.
The melt rate of the rest of the remaining ice sheet would also increase.
It is unknown at what rate these would occur.
That's what's so hard to get people, especially conservatives to understand: It's not about when the "worst" ecological impacts of climate change hit, it's about when just enough shifts to make the way we do things inviable (like mass changes in rainfall making regional crops fail) or put too much weight on already rickety systems (like forcing the world to swallow mass-refugees from vast geographical areas all at once while we're also already paying 3x more for groceries than we were 10 years ago).
