Yeah, but all of those currencies exist in forex pairs where both partners underlying valuations are based on the spread from the currency reserve, my only point here is that manipulating the size of units as the FED is doing isn’t the same as actually altering their value - in other words, we are still using dollars in everyday application at their appropriately devalued rate, the cost increase at the pump and market are real and that’s where the value is actually lost.
Take a look at how the Bretton Woods gold backed value system negatively affected the value of the US dollar regardless of it being the strongest currency in the pact, as with all systems of value you can move the negative value around but can’t just snap and make it go away….
Yep.
As an independent though, how the Dems tackle every hockey stick graph of their making starting Jan 20, 2020 remains to be seen.
The list is long and y’all know the issues.
Good luck.
If you understand finance you know it isn’t, the FED rate hikes are artificially suppressing the value of other currencies by reducing the amount of reserve currency (US dollar) they are valued against - that’s like saying the inch is stronger because it grew in lenh thus all other fish now contain fewer calories - it’s a burn and you can only do it once per dollar, newsflash, there ARE NOT infinite dollars (velocity not static) to burn.
So no, ALL currencies are losing value at commiserate rates (except the Pound - yikes), but the mighty FED, for a time, can keep ours sinking slower - so we get a temporary imbalance but put up against commodities or finished goods the power of the dollar is failing - albeit slowly….
