Tomorrow was another day, so two years ago I got myself sober and off the streets.
I worked my fuckin ass off to educate myself because I dropped out in Grade 10.
Not only to meet the post-secondary requirements for the program but getting a massive head start on the curriculum so I can take a full course load, I got a developmental disability so I need to work around that like that.
A lot of bullshit happened in that past two years but I kept going.
Then one day I go to McDonalds at the wrong fucking time, I end up being one of three people a violent psychopath tries to stab.
I guess it was made worse by just having carpal tunnel surgery and realizing, or having to feel what it felt like to be attacked and not have your very most primal means to defend yourself.
No fists.
As difficult as it is to accept, we must accept the fact that there are a minority of people who experience severe suffering, and have exhausted all possible resources, techniques, and strategies known to medical science, and simply have no other option except to continue to suffer or die with dignity.
