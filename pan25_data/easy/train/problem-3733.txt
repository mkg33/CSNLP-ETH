I live in Europe and all police encounters where pleasant exept one where I had a car crash and the police didn't even leave their cars to properly asses the situation.
The best interaction I had is when I had a car crash where I crashed against the railing on the autobahn and I lost controll totaling my car the police was realy nice even letting me wait in their car while I waited for pick up.
When I honestly toled them how fast I was (I was to fast for the turn) they toled me you probably where driving with less speed would be kinda bad on the inshurence report if you where driving that fast.

Oregon just voted to allow police officers to be in charge of granting or denying basic constitutional rights.
That's going to require a LOT of additional funding for the po-po.
