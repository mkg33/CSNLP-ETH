The Abrams is not a tank that exists in a void, it is a complete weapons system.
That includes multiple M-88A2 recovery vehicles for each unit/division of tanks, Fuel delivery vehicles to keep up with the RAVENOUS appetite of the machines (Probably HEMTTs, as Ukraine has some already and is familiar) depot facility tooling, spares, and maintenance/operational training.
Idk what you're hearing but most are starting to say it's all a waste of money.
Also, democrats own guns as well.
The Civil unrest period in 2019 really drove gun sales through the roof.
Nothing boosts gun sales like a Democrat president.
Never underestimate the Ukrainians.
They have shown themselves to be incredibly capable and creative on the battlefield, ffs their unit coordination system achieves 30 seconds from "target spotted" over "clear to fire" to "target destroyed", orders of magnitude faster than Nato, much less Ruzzia.
It is silly isn’t it?
Pretty much the only thing that is taken out an Abrams is another Abrams or maybe a TOW missile.
They’re tough as hell and have both reactive armor and the Trophy system, active protection against infantry fired antitank weapons.
US gave the system to the Israelis and they Merkeva tanks have used them to great success.
