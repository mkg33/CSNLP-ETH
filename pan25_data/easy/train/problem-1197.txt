By replacing box 1 taxable compensation with non-monetary forms of compensation, it effectively reduces not only the employee's FICA taxes (and income tax), but it commensurately decreases the employer's FICA tax liability as well.
7.65% of $100,000 is $7,650, or $765 for every $10,000 in non-monetary compensation.
The Trump Organization defrauded the IRS of $765 in FICA tax for every $10,000 of non-monetary compensation.
The actual tax evasion is double that($1,530 for every $10,000) as the employee's share wasn't paid either, but to claim the Trump Organization didn't benefit from this scheme is an outright lie.
