Shireen and her fellow journalists were deliberately and repeatedly targeted, with an aim to kill.
We identified the bullet retrieved from Shireen’s skull as common to IOF military ‘marksmen’, whose guns are commonly equipped with an optical scope (Trijicon) that magnifies their vision 4x, and would have made their targets clearly visible.
The reconstruction of the timeline of events confirms that the marksman had at least twenty seconds in which to visually assess the journalists before shooting the first round, and eight seconds in which to look at them in between the first and second rounds.
Trajectory analysis of shots fired reveals a clear line of fire from the IOF’s position toward the group of journalists; close proximity between the gunshots’ impact points, suggesting precise aim; and the consistent positioning of those impact points at above-shoulder height, indicating intent to kill.
Did it though?
If anything the situation in the middle east is even more explosive, and Russia now has Syria effectively as a Soviet Union block satellite state, including entire brigades and AA missile batteries stationed there.
Great!
I suppose you also support cutting funding to a Palestine, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan and half the other Middle Eastern countries that call for death to America.
