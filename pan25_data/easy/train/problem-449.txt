I honestly think that was a psyop, lol.
Imagine seeing your stronger enemy's intelligence agency gravely announce their analysis shows that Ukraine would fall in the exact same amount of time your own intelligence agency has told you it would fall.
Only you haven't publically announced this number yet and you also don't know that your own intelligence agency has been feeding you bullshit numbers for years due to corruption and government officials punishing FSB officers who submit anything but a glowing report.
You'd probably think "damn, I've got this invasion IN THE BAG if even the CIA thinks Ukraine will fall in a couple days.
".
Or anti-Putin intelligence operation.
Get the various factions in the FSB believe there's a war between factions.
Get them looking over their shoulder and simple mistakes might be attributed to sabotage by another faction.
Get Putin looking at them and wonder which one will win and who he needs to kill next.
The next execution that happens might trigger and all out fracture/chaos.
