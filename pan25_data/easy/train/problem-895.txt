.. most of these men are showing up for a paycheck or under duress .. he would need at least a million men to make a dent which I am certain he could do with enough money (how many more with common sense would leave for Georgia I wonder?

There is a very real chance that the Russian plan at this time is to leave the troops there as bullet sponges, existing only to hold what they can over their dead bodies while Russia (tries to) keep Ukraine from advancing by way of feints (Belarus) or attacks on the infrastructure (missile salvos).
Spending this time to actually train and equip a competent army for one final push/turn at negotiations is probably the smartest thing Russia can do right now (short of abandoning the folly all together).
Debatable.
By rough estimation Russia has only lost about half of their equipment(even less for aviation although they might be running out of pilots).
Even if the remaining part is old, they still have plenty.
Operation Iraqi freedom and enduring freedom are two examples of special military operations that were lost against primitive technology.
So modern weapons only go so far.
