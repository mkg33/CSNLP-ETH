Hedge funds and investors forever locking Americans out of home ownership is one of my greatest fears.
May this legislation pass swiftly and force divestiture from the BlackRocks of the world.
FYI.
These large hedge funds and institutions couldn’t even buy these homes until 2011 when the housing economy was so fcked up, so Congress passed a bill to allow these institutions to stabilize the market.
TLDR; These financial institutions/Hedge Funds caused the crash, then lobbied congress to let them buy the houses at the cheapest prices in decades to “stabilize”.
And now they own all the houses, forcing Americans to rent at higher prices, destroying the main wealth creator of the USA, home ownership.

Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Importantly, combine not actually owning shares with something called Payment-for-Order-Flow (see: ) and, subsequently, with stock lending and something called a Failure-to-Deliver, it's truly not an exaggeration to say that there's a network of drunk, coked out Wall Street psychopaths skimming off the top billions and billions of dollars that should be going to the middle and lower classes.
