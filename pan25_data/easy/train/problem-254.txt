Your religion is just as contradictory as every other religion.
What makes you think you are right and every other religion is wrong?
If you think your god is not just as much of a fabrication as all the rest then you are very much deluded.
Every other religion has the same arguments to justify theirs being the one true religion following the one true god(s).
Those arguments are how so many ridiculous wars have started.
Your religion is just as made up as the rest of them.
To paraphrase what someone else once said, "The only difference between an atheist and you is the atheist doesn't believe in one extra god".
What is more likely, that the thousands of gods and religions that have existed, other than yours, are all wrong?
Or that all religions are wrong?
Well the US propaganda machine is trying it's absolute hardest to do so and literally had to resort to exploiting Masha Amini's death as a "fk you" after the nuclear deal collapsed which by the way Iran was more than happy to resign with the same terms, but Congressional assholes "with their negotiating power didn't like the terms".
