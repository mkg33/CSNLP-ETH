Now, returning to the abhorrent actions of Miller, she doesn't seem to discuss whether the strategy she was implementing had any basis in fact whatsoever (i.e.
could the government show that their dog whistle argument 'we're catching the dole bludgers' was working through statistics, or forensic research).
It seems she took the instruction completely for granted, and abused the bias in various media outlets to create dissent that discredits actual journalism.
Similar to tactics that Murdoch media outlets utilise every day to foment conflict among groups with the explicit intent to distract everyone from focussing on the actual issues in society.
Thanks.
It still just blows my mind that even governmental records weren't considered good enough in terms of proof.
I realise it was a federal policy and I worked for the state government, but if even governmental records weren't considered good enough what chance did most people have of being able to gather sufficient proof.
I realise it's just more bad faith on top of bad faith, but it was absolutely set up so that people had no chance.
