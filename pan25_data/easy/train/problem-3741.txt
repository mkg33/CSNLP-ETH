Eventually we end up where we are now, at the mercy of white collar terrorists.
IE: "if you seek justice for me I will use all my political power to destroy everything around me".
Which in a vacuum isn't a big deal, but get even 5 politically powerful people backed into a corner operating in this fashion and their reach is surprisingly far because it's very easy to find allies with people who should be adversaries to our nation.
Leading to the extremist threat being more and more genuine because now there's financial backing, less useful idiots, more organized clandestine operators, and eventually it's "better for the country to fail at getting this small fish fried and go after the big one".
This never happens because it's a shell game with finite resources.
People in government know this, people working against the government definitely intend to exploit it, the GOP's platform is vindicated by it even... One could even see some of the more recent laws/efforts for how "money is speech" and "disrupting government resources meaninglessly is a valid political view" was just the next logical step to overthrowing our current way of life...
I get 10, or 20 mgs.
I can have either dosage, as much as I need to eat I can, as to palative care.
