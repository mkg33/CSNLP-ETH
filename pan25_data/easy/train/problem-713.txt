So only capitalist counties are the only ones responsible for helping other countries with diseases and famine?
If you have any statistics on the death toll from capitalism I’d like to take a look.
They want selective seasonal immigration.
i.e.
seasonal migrant workers to work jobs that Germans don't want.
And protection of desirable jobs from migrants (e.g.
doctors, engineers, cultural jobs, etc.
).
I’m mad as hell about all the abuses and awfulness that the capitalist system create and perpetuate, but pretending that other systems have not also been horrendously awful (as if other things being awful would somehow excuse the terrible things about capitalism, which they don’t) is just childish black and white thinking and doesn’t help the anti-capitalist cause.
Thanks, dude.
I also used to camp near a farm at 18 to volunteer at a dig (and had to use the showers there to slough off the mud/dirt I accumulated at the end of the day).
It was eye-opening seeing the accommodations and facilities up-close, so I really don't blame you for staying away after trying!
