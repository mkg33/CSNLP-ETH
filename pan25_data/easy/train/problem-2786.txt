This is how I do it.
Is the person a conservative?
If the answer is yes.
They arguably have a very low sense of morals and personal responsibility, and probably enjoy watching other people suffer.
And aren’t worth voting for in the 1st place If they aren’t a conservative.
Then I go looking.
If a source is known to be conservative media.
I trust it far less than ones labeled liberal as they spread more lies, slander, and misinformation than liberal sources, or leftist sources.
Basically it takes minimal effort to verify if a politician is a bad person, they call themselves conservatives.
Interesting.

Somehow I suspect they're more concerned it will cut into executive compensation.
Republican primary voters.
The craziest of the crazy, the ones who voted for whoever Trump endorsed without even considering whether that person could win the general.
The folks whose cars are covered with "Let's go Brandon!"
stickers are the ones steering the ship.
