Speaking anecdotally, it's the racism that matters.
Any time I've ever tried to get a clear picture of what they actually support, I've discovered a layer of bullshit that masks a deep resentment towards the Democrats based on racism.
My aunts and uncles still talk about the "good old days" when the public pools were segregated.
And, how black people "ran them out" of their beloved Brightwood neighborhood.
I remember reading a Stephen King story that had a line where one of the characters said something to the effect that the Republicans are the party of nice, white Christians and the Democrats are the party of ns.
For the R's I've had to deal with around me, that seems to pretty much sum up their entire philosophy.
The state Democratic Party is completely incompetent outside of Indianapolis.
It wasn’t always that way, but it is now.
There are counties in the suburbs of Indy where they just seem to not even be trying.
There’s no reason why they shouldn’t be able to make gains, but there’s just no effort anymore.
Sane voters just stay home.
