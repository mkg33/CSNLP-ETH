So probation is suitable for you....but not a sickness that keeps mutating?
Really?
Like im not even a lock down nut idc if you got vaccinated if you did great if you didn't hey god bless.
Probation is > than a pandemic to you lol.
Oh and for the downvoters....is it still up for debate that this came from China?
So now they've ended the lockdowns their citizens haven't had a vaccine now they're free to travel out into the world to places that achieved some measure of normalcy without being a totalitarian regime that can FORCE its people to get vaccinated but did not.
Instead of helping their people they bolted them in their homes in restaurants where ever.
That is some resident evil level shit.
Despite what my brother and sister citizens whom are conservative in America think we didn't even got a taste of what a real one party system can do to fuck things up we didn't get it half as bad as it could have.
That being said your last sentence I semi agree with.
I'll also say it's incredibly irresponsible to send their citizens out into the world.
I've had my fill of being sick pal.
actually didn't become mandatory until recently, this last summer.
When the city of Bejing made it mandatory for every to be vaccinated against Covid in order for them to enter public spaces.
Up until then it looks like the National policy was for voluntary vaccinations.
I think it's change bye now.
