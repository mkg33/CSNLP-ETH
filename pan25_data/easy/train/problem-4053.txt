We were told a while ago that were we going to be overtaken by a private company that runs pathology services.
They would take over the entire lab, rip out the analysers, software, the whole lot.
But not the staff.
They employed every last one of us in the same positions as they do not have a big pool of staff knocking about.
We ended up getting paid more, and had overtime available to us on top of our earnings.
The only position that was lost was head of pathology as she retired and they decided to manage the lab from a central position.
Nixon started the Environmental Protection Agency.
Our current conservatives openly talk about establishing a white, evangelical christian, ethnostate.
I had a sleep study a few years ago.
I scheduled an appointment to meet the specialist, gave him the symptoms, etc., so we were ready to schedule a sleep study.
But not at the place in the same building, even though I was covered for the specialist, because that wasn't in network.
No, I had to drive to another place 30 miles away.
Still cost me $1000, too.
