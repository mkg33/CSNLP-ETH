In Norway the past year there have been several lawsuits related to lack of service when needed or if something breaks.
A case in the media now, one had his seat come loose, and Tesla could not find a permanent solution to fix it in 2 years.
The closest service center was several hours drive away, and they were overwhelmed as is.
So each time the seat came loose, he had to drive it for months before he could get it fixed.
He did feel the driving was unsafe due to it and asked for a full refund via the Norwegian consumer council due to the long wait.
Teslas response?
They filed a lawsuit back against him.
How many times did you see about Tesla recalls, many of them are simple matters of software and/or software updates, so basically drivers did the "recall" over night without any worry or even knowing about it, while you didn't hear anything about other's like Toyota for example that had more than 10 million recalls in 2022, all had to be delivered to a real garage for a few hours, hurting the consumer.
