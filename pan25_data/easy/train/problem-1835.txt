I'm not calling for Canada to throw out its armored units.
I'm saying they can send their current inventory to Ukraine without sacrificing security in any real way.
The Canadian land, sea, and air units are more than capable of defending Canada.
Any kind of overseas contingency that Canada would go to would be with other allies (when has Canada fought alone?)
and couldn't have tanks in-theater quickly anyway.
That's something a tank can't do.
They are too heavy and logistics-heavy to be quickly deployed.
The armored forces Canada had in Afghanistan were reliant on US logistics as well as loaned equipment from countries like Germany and the Netherlands.
An agile force is better off without too much weight.
Serious question.
What approvals does Trudeau require to make such commitments?
A large part of me says.
In reality, not having strong armoured forces already got us caught with our pants down in Afghanistan--resulting in dead Canadian soldiers--and in any event in which we immediately have to deploy overseas, we will immediately be caught with our pants down again.
