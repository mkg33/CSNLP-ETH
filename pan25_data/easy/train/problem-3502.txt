It's a stupid ironic Mexican joke, "Putin" is a slang way of saying "Puto" wich is derogatory term used to call friends or other people, it's original use was directed to gay people "that guy is a puto(gay)", but like I said, nowadays friends use it between themselves in a friendly manner, like: "Que onda puto" (what's up puto), it's part of our lenguage and pretty sure it's used all over Latin America as well.

I knew when he was 5.
He came out to me at 15.
I just laughed and said no shit.
