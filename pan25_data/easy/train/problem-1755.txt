There was a video posted interviewing some soldiers and they said it messed them up how so many Russians just walked to their death.
Some would attack without magazines in their rifles.
Others just walked towards them in the open.
Some seemed so oblivious to everything that they must have been on some powerful drugs.
Each one of these, they had to kill and the bodies piled up.
And each time it's the same thing over and over.
Unironically, it is psychologically damaging the Ukrainian defenders.
Killing people is generally a very difficult experience, even in those circumstances.
Sure.
I mean it's good propaganda, and Ukraine's successes are vast and Russian losses are as well.
Fuck Russia and Putin.
I'm simply stating that having an accurate enemy loss count on a daily basis is impossible.
Down votes are hilarious.

Russia is clearly not far left, you'd have to be stupid to think so, the Soviet Union was also not far left, and China isn't either.
