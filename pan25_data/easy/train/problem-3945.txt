You make good points but I think many moderate, centrist Dems are really not getting, even now, that millions of people voted to get the former piece of trash out of the presidency.
Biden would certainly win again against Trump but DeSantis?
Enough low-info “indepedent” voters would “give him a chance” over Biden.
I am biased against Biden though so maybe Im not giving him enough credit.
Its not even him, I just hate anything remotely Blue Dog/Third Way and he was a big part of that which led to Dems playing the dark money game like their counterparts.
I get it but hate it.
Expecting every Progressive everywhere to have identical results to Bernie is like expecting every Moderate everywhere to perform like Hillary.
Fuck no on Harris.
I mean, fuuuuuuuck no.
When she was the first to drop out of the last Dem primary with 1-3% support, she shouldve never even been VP imo.
California Governor Gavin Newsom hasn't managed California well.
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger very easily brushed off any recall nonsense.
Most Californians would prefer Jerry Brown was still the Governor.
Newsom simply road Brown's coattails.
