This is probably not the case and the missle was Ukrainian anti-air.
Will wait for investigation to conclude.
The S-300 is used by Russia exactly like land to land missle, 20 of them hit Ukraine on August 25.
They repurpuse old S-300 for that instead of taking them off the balance.
And as anti-air they have the newer S-400.
not necessarily.
If NATO can avoid escalation, they can still use this as an excuse to provide more air defense or equipment.
We allow russia to avoid blame.
No escalation.
But were going to give ukraine more equipment.
As bad as escalation would be for the world, it would be exceptionally bad for russia.
Exactly.
Poland has hated Russia for the longest time and is on Ukraines side.
There's no reason they would lie and reverse course after prematurely blaming Russia.
If anything, Poland is probably disappointed by its findings.
Falsely blaming Russia for serious events such as attacking a NATO country could trigger anxiety/ paranoia from Russia and a possible nuclear conflict that would be a good study case for future civilizations.
