This is way oversimplifying more complex issues.
The US can't just send the M1A2 Abrams because it has a far, far more complex logistical trail (I am not even an expert and this is obvious; the Abrams is a jet engines vehicle using jet fuel, whereas the leopard is known as a reliable vehicle that runs on basic diesel).
The Germans suggesting that the US Send this type of tank strikes me as a deflection and a way to make their objection seem more reasonable (despite the fact that Germany under its latest prime minister has dragged its feet at literally every single request for cooperation from the rest of the west on this conflict-- at the beginning of the conflict they were refusing to share existing supplies of NLAWS and Javelins along with any lethal aid, only agreeing to send kits to build field hospitals and a shipment of helmets).
No, right?
Then by definition you have to be opposed to Russia's invasion and in favour of continued support of Ukrainian fighting.
Somewhere around 80+ % of people in Ukraine want a return to their legally recognized borders, and they are willing to either fight or suffer in the war as long as continued support comes from us in our warm, well-lit homes.
Fun fact.
Germany is the second largest donor of military equipment to Ukraine after only the US.
Hardly what someone who wants Ukraine to die would do.
