This is a party eager to usher in a regressive platform, to implement an agenda steeped in lies and entitlement, their chauvinism disguised as patriotism, jingoism disguised as some counter-revolutionary movement seeking to destroy a radical left-wing monster of its own manufacturing, and all while a rift within their party has them bickering over which faction's anachronistic vision will come to fruition.
Sort of.
They need a majority of people present and not voting "present".
It is possible for some people to walk out or vote "present".
If enough people do that then it could change things.
But if republicans do that then it could hand the speaker position to a democrat.
They could also vote to change the rules so the person with the most votes wins, but that again would hand the position to a democrat.
