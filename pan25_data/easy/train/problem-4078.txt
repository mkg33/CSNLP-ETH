People lie.
Words can be tailored to the audience.
But actions speak louder than words.
Actions don’t lie.
When someone shows you who they are, believe them.
The GOP needing to have an emergency convo with Tim Cook over Twitter should be as obvious as a shout into a bullhorn.
They don’t give a shit about “free speech” or “free markets”.
They want their friends to be able to say racists shit on Twitter.
Because that’s where their votes come from.
Full stop.
Republicans want Twitter alive because authoritarians like Putin are on their side, and Putin already ran successful propaganda campaigns on there.
Rich elites love it, too.
If you think this is all about racism or free speech or whatever, you're missing the big picture.
And if you have dumb Twitter fights with racists who are as likely to be foreign trolls as not, then you are helping them.
That is what they want to happen.
Fighting culture wars on twitter means you're not fighting for workers rights or for better healthcare or against corruption.
