This story went around in the web design world when SCOTUS agreed to hear the case and it was as apparent then as it is now that she's an absolute talentless clown who's business is populating wordpress and square space themes for slow witted boomers and that she isn't very successful.
You can check out her website if you want.
It's all free stock photos from places like and free/cheap already built/designed themes that she's watermarked as "copyrighted" (lol).
The idea that her work represents some kind of artistic expression is so fucking ridiculous.
Exactly.
And where is the line?
Can Christian’s then be allowed to refuse services to Jews bc “it’s my religious belief that Jews killed Christ”?Can Sunni Muslims then refuse service to Sikhs bc of their “religious belief”?
The SC already decided that laws against animal sacrifice and marijuana use were not infringing on the “freedom of religion” when one religious group and Rastafarians tried challenging the laws.
So how is the 14th and an infringement on religious liberty?
