As a Swiss, I have to explain that sadly our direct democracy system is very slow.
Our hearts are in the right place, at least.
Trying to make things work.
In this particular case being too advanced is a curse because it’s useless to say “my AA batteries can effectively take down high altitude targets, missiles or even satellites” if your enemy has some shitty ordnance with wings that they can be thrown at you for pocket change… Well, a curse for Ukraine cuz NATO could keep firing multi million dollar Patriot missiles at them until Russia and its pathetic Allies go bankrupt buying drones….
I wasn't clear.
Russia is using S-300 and S-400 missiles to attack ground targets in Ukraine right now.
They have replaced that capability largely with Shahed drones.
That's why I compared the prices between the two.
In this case, the S-300 missle is the weapon, not the AA defense.
Exactly.
They aren’t fast nor stealth and they don’t really have countermeasures for AA from what I’ve read on the internet, basically just off brand guided munition but with a surprising range.
And while you can effectively counter them with phased out AA tech and tactics you need a metric fuckton of old guns to cover even the important places of Ukraine which, again, is really big.
