Oh no, I am absofuckingloutly cheering for dead Russian infantry Ok cheering is the wrong word but... You missed the soviet battle flags on the tanks on the Kiev campaign, huh?
Yeah, some may have thought they were going on exercises, but some saw it as a great patriotic duty.
And one that would bring back the glory of the soviet union.
A glory that saw 10s of millions killed but the Soviet government.
Then there are the war crimes, the looting, the z covered cars in Georgia, and elsewhere.
These weren't people opposed to a "special military operation" they were people who didn't want to die.
They lost any sympathy I have for them after every war crime, and there are thousands The only way this ends is the massive casualties and deaths land firmly on Russia's doorstep.
It was significantly less casualties that ended the Afganistan campaign.
Hey!
Yeah I do mean that.
And by major wars, I was more referencing wars on a grand scale with millions of deaths lasting years.
I'm not familiar with too much further on than the seven years war, but even then, there was really no good or bad side in this conflict.
Admittedly, I hadn't thought of the Opium Wars, but I still wouldn't place that in this reference as both wars combined had less than 10,000 deaths.
The Boer wars weren't great, but it had very little impact on history beyond being a staging ground for the race for Africa later on.
