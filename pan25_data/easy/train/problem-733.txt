But the people who actually gather the information for the economists have all been saying that there's something real fucky about this wave of inflation: it's advancing well ahead of any actual increases in wage or in overhead - arbitrary corporate price markups (companies seeing the strain COVID put/continues to put on the global economy, raising their prices and then adding a healthy bit ontop well above what they need to cover their increase in overhead and going "Haha, COVID's really fucking us all, huh?")
are the primary driver of this current wave of inflation.
It's companies taking advantage of a global health emergency to feed a little bit (read: a lot) more to their executives and shareholders.
Seriously!
When banks give interest free loans (creating money from thin air) to the Rich so they can buy more stocks and a new Yacht It's ok, but It's bad if workers get some of that money.
Interesting.
In the United States, chairman Jerome Powell called on companies to reduce hiring and refuse raises so prices wouldn't need to increase to maintain the same elevated profit margin.
