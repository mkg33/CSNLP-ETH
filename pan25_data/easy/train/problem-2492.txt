Regarding her view on Muslims, she once seemingly disliked the idea of being interviewed by a Muslim BBC reporter (I couldn’t immediately find the clip, but there are numerous accounts of this incident).
Does it matter?
The narrative apologists are trying to make is that "it was out of her control."
The reality is that she openly spoke against the Chin (because they arent Buddhist) against the Shan (because they aren't Buddhist) and refused to denounce the brutality during the Karen/Kayan rebellion which ended in 2014 (before she took power).
At The Hague?
Didn’t seem like it.
She also took issue when a Pakistani “Muslim” was interviewing her.
There’s no way to revise the fact that she was complicit, and the Burmese who are now asking for help, were actively supporting the genocide.
She's a sanctimonious, nepotistic figurehead.
I understand why people want to believe in her, and her activism before her Peace Prize was admirable.
But she's been utterly corrupted by political game-playing.
Burma can do better.
