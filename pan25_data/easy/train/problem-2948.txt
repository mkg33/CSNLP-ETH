Russia's allies aren't looking very powerful right now.
China has been suffering from Covid related economic decline and a real estate market collapse.
China is also preoccupied with Taiwan.
Iran is dealing with economic problems and massive protests.
Other Russian allies are struggling as well.
Russia's prospects for forming an alliance that could challenge Western nations was better before they invaded Ukraine.
This is another Russian fantasy of restoring their position as a world power.
Seriously.
They've got nothing to negotiate with except leaving Ukraine and ending this stupid fucking war.
Wonderful.
I’m happy to hear it.
My anecdotal experience is only that: situational and personal to me.
I work with some Russians in an academic/occasionally private sector settings.
The ones I’ve met are frankly kind of unusually spiteful—their colleagues (I am not a scientist, I’m in tech transfer/patent administration) find them difficult to work with.
I am admittedly chastened by the above comment that the stereotypes I am reporting could be applied to other ethnicities … unfairly.
I apologize for perpetuating a loathsome behavior.
I guess if you can’t say something nice about someone, you should just bite your tongue.
I’ve learned my lesson.
