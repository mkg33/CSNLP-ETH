Just throwing this out there: Speaker and Committee Chairs should be elected positions voted on by the House members, and to hold those positions you cannot be an active representative.
Reason: Much like cabinet members which are approved must resign their house or senate seat, Speaker and major committee chairs are positions of national importance that should not be held in check by a 700,000 population district either.
Also like cabinet members are approved by Senate vote, Speaker and chair seats can be approved by the House vote.
They can have an written or unwritten requirement that a number of years as an elected representative is expected to be nominated.
