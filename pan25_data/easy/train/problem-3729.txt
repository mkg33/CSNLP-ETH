Iâ€™m not even going to get into how heavily defended silos are.
Talking literal bunkers with feet thick walls and doors designed not to get broken into simultaneously into triple digit sites deep into Russia which would require a coordinated effort from multiple fronts.
So let me get this straight.
Russia is taking criminals.
Putting them in situations where either they die or learn how to use weapons to survive.
Even if they do survive, the environment they were subjected to is so hostile that most survivors walk away with at least some form of mental trauma.
Added to that is that a good percentage of the people already have substance abuse problems and lack impulse control.
Wagner is literally recruiting violent criminals.
These aren't tax cheats.
The system most highly incentivizes those serving the longest sentences, so it's the murders and rapists that are first to volunteer.
So I am indeed short on empathy, but I think it's you who is short on critical thinking.
Many autocratic regimes have entire multiple competing militaries, not simply divisions of a single military.
It makes it harder to overthrow a leader by simply taking a single institution, but the competition also causes infighting like we are seeing in Russia.
