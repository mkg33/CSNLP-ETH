- China finds Canada's actions in the Meng / Huawei / European lobbying situation particularly frustrating and at this point Xi doesn't event respect Trudeau enough to talk to him.
- Xi thinks Canada represented by Trudeau is the little brother of the US and doesn't even deserve a seat at the table with China given the poor relations.
- Xi thinks that Trudeau probably took advantage of this unscripted meeting to make Trudeau seem more legitimate than he is (when Xi doesn't even want to give Trudeau time of day).
I don't think Xi is upset about the content of their initial conversation, but rather the circumstances and how Trudeau attempted to frame it into much more than it was.
My two cents:
We made one observation about Indigenous People's possible pause at Canada making an observation about genocide.
Yeah.
Trying to get balanced and well-reported news from Reddit becomes very problematic.
I tried to get some sense of what happened in r/Afghanistan when the US evacuated.
Most of the comments and news are about India's nationalism.
Seriously.
Screw them.
The biggest mistake western democracies have made in the last 50 years is allowing China to become the world's manufacturer.
It needs to stop.
