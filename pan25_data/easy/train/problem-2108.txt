In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Republican politicians arenâ€™t populists.
They use culture wars to rile people up.
They get angry about whatever they can in order to draw in that specific single issue voter.
Put enough angry single issue voters together and you get a coalition.
They then take that coalition and use it for whatever they actually want to pass, such as tax cuts.
Not necessarily.
Citizen redistricting does help and it helps keep races a lot more competitive.
This does tend to dull extremism and force candidates to have a broader appeal.
Nowadays?
Gay marriage is now legal.
Has been for well over 7 years.
One of the biggest politicians in the country is an openly gay man.. with a husband.
