I agree, right now you have districts in Idaho and Oregon going: "We are going to merge districts and become our own states.
Then when you look at those districts you are: "Well, how are you going to keep your economy going?
You don't have any REAL trade or NEEDED supplies for the state or other countries?"
They basically are: "I'm tired of following your rules and your 'morals' and I don't have to take it anymore."
Could they and WILL THEY try it?
Sure.
However, they would not last.
They would just get other red areas to "try it".
Screw up travel and trade for several years.
While the GOP looks the other way or tries to support it only to kill more and more of the party.
They keep thinking it's the 1860s.
You can just get some states to agree and form your own government.
When they don't realized that back then, states were pretty reliant on each other and that's how they worked then.
Now, they can't function without the main federal government.
Plus half of these people who are: "Look at our massive guns and my small pensis."
Would go running with you know the main National Guards or military bombing them.
It is just not functioning AT ALL.
But as we have learned from MAGA and Trump: "Why not, what do I have to lose?
".
Even California, that famously blue state that every conservative hates, in a year where Democrats were highly favored and Republicans were deeply unpopular, still voted 35% Republican.
