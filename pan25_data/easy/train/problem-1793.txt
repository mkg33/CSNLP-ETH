Tell that to the farmers in Jazan, and Najran, who were being raided, whose lands were used to smuggle Ethiopian slaves, drugs, and arms into Saudi for over a decade by the houthis, before the thought of intervening in Yemen ever occured to anyone.
Balls.
Saleh stepped down, Hadi stepped up and declared an election with the options of "Me" or "Me".
Yemeni society fractured on supporting Saleh or Hadi.
The Army did the same and Saleh loyal factions forced out Hadi and returned Saleh.
Hadi was supported by Saudi.
Saleh had the support of the Houthis and a large part of the army.
Saleh decided this whole thing wasn't really his thing and the Houthis killed him, with the other factions supporting him either joining the Houthis or trying to go it alone and coming to separate agreements with the Saudi backed government.
Simplifying it to "terrorists" is dumbing it down far too much.
AQAP supported Hadi and for a brief period were the only terrorists in the world who could call in airstrikes.
There isn't any justification.
If Ukraine shot back at Russia and killed kids, that'd be unjustifiable too.
