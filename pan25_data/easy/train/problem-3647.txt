I manage one of the Amazon DSPs and I feel the pain.
They put all these stupid restrictions and we have to follow them or else we risk losing our contract (I wanna beat to death the guy that enacted engines off at every stop).

Amazon should be paying all their employees way more, especially as we move into the peak holiday season.

Exactly.
That shit is becoming less and less viable as a way of living as time goes on.
They need to match pay increases to inflation rates at the very least.
