The House of Representatives (the lower chamber of Congress, the legislative body of government) requires that a speaker is elected to govern the body before anything else can occur (including the swearing in of members).
Since Republicans hold a slim majority of seats, it’s been presumed that their party leader, Kevin McCarthy, would be elected the new speaker.
However contingents of the Republican Party do not support McCarthy for various reasons.
Since a majority of votes are needed to become speaker (218 if every representative vote), and since there are only 222 Republicans, McCarthy can’t afford to lose more than 4 votes; he currently needs about 16 more or so.
If no one reaches 218 votes, they vote again; this repeats until someone reaches the threshold.
Disqualify Kevin McCarthy!
This is just embarrassing and a complete mockery of the American government.
This is making the US look incompetent, especially if he gets in after ten votes or however many it takes.
No one in this world who is good at what they do gets this many attempts.
