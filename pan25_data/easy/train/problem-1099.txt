If I have my comprehension secure, this meant that as opposed to being enslaved by the Portuguese for example, where your community may have fallen victim to a larger foreign country looking to expand and proliferate, or being enslaved by a neighboring tribe or regional clan with whom you had familiarity and regularly skirmished with, being enslaved in this instance meant you were being deemed and treated as objectively subhuman, and therefore naturally befitting of being enslaved and owned for the usage of your betters.
For most of human history, if you became a slave, it may have been because someone in your family lost a duel, or because an associate merchant would need to pay a high ransom to free you, or maybe you had just happened to be foraging for mushrooms in the wrong place at the wrong time.
It could happen to most anyone, for most any reason, and those reasons were arbitrary and largely irrelevant to whom you personally were or what you looked like.
Suddenly, though, the idea that there were whole, sprawling swaths of humans out there just WAITING to be enslaved, existing as pre-made beasts of burden, rather than simply hapless people trying to live their lives, meant that slavers had carte blanche to start aggressively raiding and rounding up targeted peoples, expressly for profit.
High school eduction?
I sincerely doubt it.
This dude skated on his football skills his entire life.
Doubt he ever sat in a classroom for long.
His teachers probably passed him since he was a star in football.
