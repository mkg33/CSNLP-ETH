The less you know the more you doubt and the more you doubt the more you fear.
You even start to cling to unhealthy things, even lies that you know are lies, of it just makes you feel a little better and a little safer.
I have complex PTSD and just finished an intensive outpatient program.
The front part of your brain and executive functioning suffers severely as blood flood is reduced there and increased in the emotional "lizard" part of our brains.
It gets so bad that I can barely retain new information sometimes, it effects memory, concentration, spelling, multi-tasking, trust, planning, an almost every aspect of day to day life that requires any complex thought and problem solving.
Then I got Covid which became long Covid and was like a wet blanket was put over my already struggling brain.
My memory got even worse.
I stopped crying so much but its still a huge challenge every day.
When those emotions were/are in overdrive my ability to think logically goes out the window.
Sometimes it started(s) with frustration that then becomes anger/depression/fear and logic goes out the window while other times it starts with something scary or fear inducing that slows/stops logical though and then becomes frustration.
Its awful and circular and feels like a catch 22.
