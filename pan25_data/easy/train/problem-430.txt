Edit to your edit - if you read those articles you’ll see that what we’re running out of is the older soviet stock that we had left over from the Cold War, and replacement ammo for those weapons.
The reason we don’t make much of that ammo anymore is because our military doctrine no longer relies on it.
The NYT article also says that we are working on replacement solutions, and that there are likely long term defense contracts on the way that will solve the ammo problem by ramping up production.
IMO anyway.
And I am no war analyst or geopolitical professor.
I am just someone saddened to the core by the news from around the world.
With Taiwan it's semiconductors almost exclusively.
And the US and EU are pushing hard to end this.
Look up how many chip factories are planned all over the US and EU.
It's done to end dependency on Taiwan, not China.
Once that's done, the US has no more reason to stand with Taiwan as there's barely any dependency on them anymore.
The US will drop support of Taiwan in favor of China.
