Take for example: the many museums of Caracas, a city I visited before Venezuela went into its current crisis.
It's a magnificent city with rich cultural heritage on display at its museums, which are fantastic.
Due to the crisis there, however, many are closed for extended periods of time or don't have the funds to maintain what they house.
Would the UK or the US be justified in looting what those museums have just to preserve certain pieces?
Why wouldn't they be loaned out like other artifacts are loaned out to museums everywhere?
A cultural artifact can live in its rightful place of origin so that its citizens can enjoy it without having to pay thousands to travel abroad and be occasionally loaned out so others can see it, as well.
Yawn.
Show me one example of an Egyptian actually calling for museums to be looted because it offends their religious sensibilities.
You're just regurgitating the tired stereotype of all Muslims being religious extremists by default because of AQ and ISIL, and assume the average Muslim gets easily offended by everything, even though most ancient Egyptian artifacts remained intact over a millennia of being ruled by Muslim leaders.
