"Mammal" as well is a very arbitrary biological classification, it's actually a great thing you've brought that up, because what we base the label on, what fits into it and how we defined animal classes has gone through massive changes within the sciences as more and more nuances were discovered (and in fact the label for sex is pretty much facing a similar journey in how we define and classify the categories and many scientists are effectively using similar arguments in redefining sex that mirror what happened with the mammals label, or rather the way we classify and label animals).
