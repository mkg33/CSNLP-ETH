Socialized healthcare is not motivated by compassion.
It's motivated by utilitarianism, full stop.
At a certain point, there are decisionmakers in the chain whose only concern is to maximize the utility of the dollars allotted.
They might be compassionate, but they are still allotting resources by strict utilitarian value in a functional socialized system.
Ok.
I'm still arguing that socialised is better and it's not disingenuous to say so as utilitarianism is based upon doing the greatest good for the greatest number of people AND I can show that it is cheaper with better outcomes by comparing countries with similar styled economies.
Infants born with severe heart defects.
Some of these cases the baby can need millions in surgery immediately following an early birth by C-section.
You see these kinds of cases advised to terminate pregnancy in countries with socialized medicine because of the resources the baby would consume with still super low odds of surviving, much less being able to live healthy and fulfilling lives.
