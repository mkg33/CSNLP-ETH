Please don't mention autism theories like that, it's too easy for it to be straight up ableism or stereotyping.
Most of the "rise" people have been diagnosed with autism can be attributed to how we know more about autism, can diagnose it earlier, and there is a bit less stigma about it - similar to left handed-ness.
I hate guns.
I hate them.
I hate that children can get ahold of them and use them on each other.
I hate that gun ownership is so normalized that children can pose with them on Christmas cards and people cheer.
I hate that toddlers can find them lying around the house and do harm to themselves or others.
I hate that a father can hear his son killed half a dozen people, and his only thought is relief that his son isn't gay.
I hate that this man, who groomed his child to be a hate-filled murderer, was not held accountable for his actions.
I hate people who collect these weapons like toys.
People who would rather see children die daily than lose their "god given right" to show off their tools of murder.
