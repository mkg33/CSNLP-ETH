I think people love to see the Russian losses but ignore the part where it said Ukraine has probably lost similar amounts.
These troops probably were elite, and probably killed a lot of the other side before being knocked out.
It’s a tragedy all around over there, for the Ukrainians defending their home, and for the Russians being sent to die for something the oligarchy decided it wants.
Russia is losing lots of people, but so is Ukraine a fact I feel is under reported and under respected, the price these people are paying for their country.
The American government.
It sort of pathetic how people on reddit downvote anything conflicting with their naive world view of Ukraine not paying for their advances in a torrent of blood.
fabulous.
someone gimme some thumbs ups so I can be in the Convo.
reddit only allows certain peoples opinions.
it's worse than Twitter.
ease frfr I need help.
As much as people want to laugh at Russia they do have modern military equipment even if all you see is rusty AKs and WW2 guns, their army isn’t entirely conscripts, and Ukraine is launching major counter offensives which attacking territory is always more deadly then defending.
