The Dem candidate last year for governor was arrested in 2016 for campaign finance charges along with her staff, but nothing ever came of it and the only reason she isn't still in an elected position is because she ran for governor instead of staying in her previous position(state superintendent).
It is.
But that seems to be where all of these recent right-wing bills that allow citizens to sue other citizens, like Don't Say Gay in FL and the abortion bill in TX, are coming from: by turning the legal system into a tool for right-wing activists to attack other citizens, they can claim the government is not the one restricting speech and thus not a 1A violation.
And then claim they are for freedom because they are giving parents the freedom to...force their ideology on entire school districts.
