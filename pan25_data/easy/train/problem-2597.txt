Have you ever watched any Iranian president speak at the UN?
Pretty much every delegate from western countries gets up and leaves the room.
They get condemned all the time.
The difference is Palestine isn't an officially recognized nation in the UN, so they are using their position as an observer state to try and pass as many resolutions as they can against Israel, because it's all they can do to raise awareness to what Israel is doing.

Also as Gahgeer mentions, Russia and Iran are already under a litany of sanctions.
Feels like you're deliberately overreacting.
The conversation should be what is Isreal doing to get these condemnation.
Stamping your feet yhst the amount t is unfair because 'others bad' is bad faith whataboutism.
Some of the tallied “anti-Israel” resolutions are literally resolutions to help Palestinians.
They are not condemnations of Israel, they are trying to help Palestine.
