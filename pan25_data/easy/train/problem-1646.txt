TBH, I think we gotta stop with the "Russia can't defeat Ukraine, hence they would be a pushover in other conflicts" argument.
Ukraine has the second largest population in Europe besides Russia, it had a massive pool of combat-experienced people to draw on for national defense who had rotated through the JFO for the past 8 years, and Russia severely miscalculated the invasion, translating to enormous losses.
None of this means that Russia still cannot severely impact other wars in ways that would still cause us immense casualties and difficulty.
I mean, the Russians are still far from out of the war in Ukraine right now and are in the process of readying \200,000 mobilized troops for an offensive.
I think that offensive will fail, but the point is that we shouldn't assume Russia is not a severely dangerous enemy to have to fight, despite their shortcomings in Ukraine.
What capability?
Iran is being a thorn in Israel's ass through their allies like Hezoballah, which Israel had issues trying to beat during 2006.
Not to mention, Iran ranks higher in the Firepower Index.
