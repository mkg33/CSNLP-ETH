I never knew this was a thing, until a month ago I got an email from our neighborhood group with one of my neighbors going off about catching the lady next door literally chunking shit over the fence into his yard.
He said the landscaper kept telling him they were finding big piles of shit in his yard every week.
And he finally caught her.

Its kind of human.
My stepfather is estranged.
He suffers from gout, and is drinking himself further down the drain, his communications to his siblings in tears in moments of lucidity.
20 years ago he looked to me the strongest man on Earth.
Now his own daughter is estranged, and I am set to be father of the bride at her wedding.
It makes me sad...
Outstanding.

That couldn’t possibly end badly….
