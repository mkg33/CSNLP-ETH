The whole weather balloon story makes no sense.
If it was a weather balloon why didn't China contact the FAA and tell them one was heading into their airspace?
A quick call or email would have ensured no panic.
Instead they've risked a diplomatic fallout.
You wouldn't do this unless there is something to hide.
What credibility?
We're just starting to move away from a failed appeasement policy and towards one of acknowledgement.
Possibly!
However, I also think most people don't really appreciate what they have too.
So we tend to be pessimistic in nature.
I choose my own fanaticism.
Autocracy will always eventually rot from the inside out as it does not have the rejuvenating properties of democracy and as any political scientist will tell you, after a while dictators always lose touch with reality and their decision making abilities drop off drastically.
Places in the west are founded on values that believe in the good of people.
Places in authoritarian places are founded on the believes of the worst in people.
Good always wins.
Humanity wouldn't have gotten this far if that wasn't the case.
You are crazy either way, so it's really just a choice of which fanaticism you believe to follow.
