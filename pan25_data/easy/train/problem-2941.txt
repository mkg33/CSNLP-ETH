The choice to hire a special counsel signals Garland’s desire to remain political and appear Party neutral.
The counsel will likely advise the DOJ to file charges, but it will be a repeat of the committees recommendation which will have been ignored.

Every lost cause narrative exists because we didn’t execute the traitors.
This will be no different.
