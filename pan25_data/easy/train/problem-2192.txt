Türkiye has been a vital member and we should never abandon them.
They have been pretty tough to deal with lately but they have earned their place in our alliance.
They fought in the Korean war and were vital during the cold war.
But their importance geographically, militarily and geopolitically has diminished.
We already have Greece in the Aegean and Romania and Bulgaria in the Black sea.
We can already sink the Russian Black sea fleet without the involvement of Türkiye.
What Finland and Sweden would provide us geographically is much more important.
The Baltic sea and capability to sink the Russian Baltic Navy and a route to the Russian Northern fleet as well as a huge land boarder with Finland.
Anyway.
Let errogadad make noise for domestic consumption.
When it’s time for f16 replacement parts and those parts are delayed, the song wjll change.
While important economically it's not that important militarily.
Access to the middle east is, especially if we have to take on Iran.
Turkiye hosting early radar warning system is another example.
Their naval bases and airfields are as well.
Especially since the sues canal is so close to it's bases.
