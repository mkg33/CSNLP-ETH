Good for them.
Why does it take a tax professional to understand how they work?
It should be easy as hell for 90% of people.
The government should make it as accessible as possible.
Other countries do it just fine.
Exactly.
This is a problem that can be solved by technology.
Amazon and Facebook already know how many children you have, whether you rent or pay a mortgage, hell, they know your underwear size.
The data is out there, it's just a matter of correlating it properly.
The IRS already had most of the information they need; hell, so does the state franchise board.
One time I forgot to file my state taxes, and the state thoughtfully sent me a letter telling me what they thought I owed.
And they were right.
The bastards ðŸ˜›.
Point is: the public service here is efficient and break-even driven, so anything that would take from the tax dollars is instead transferred to the citizen: for instance I had to pay US$200 for my marriage license, and when I converted it to the French system it was entirely free despite my not paying taxes in France, and it being more costly with all the remote element (sending the paper work etc).
Why is France wasting tax dollar on this.
