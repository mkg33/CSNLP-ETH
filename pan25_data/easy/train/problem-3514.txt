What I mean is that you seemingly believe that there is no possible attempt from billionaires to influence or control the spread of information on the internet (or possibly in academia) in the exact same manner as they did with television, and your “evidence” is a cheap summation of Republican economics as “tax cuts for the rich” not working and a specific criticism of Fox News as if it is the only purveyor of misinformation in cable news.
Unless, of course, the fascists win.
