Won't invade Europe, but will be a massive pain in the ass, causing chaos, disrupting order, and Russia still has a large enough military to conduct offensives, don't get it twisted.
There IS some logic to expecting Russia to act militarily on another European country after Ukraine.
When I say security, I'm not talking about Russia bulldozing through Europe, but creating humanitarian crises, satellite conflicts, power shifts.
All issues that arise when an imperialist nation gets away with blatant aggression.
You have to look at security not just as a risk of war but a disruption of status quo that is held together by international law.
For example the Transnitstria issue comes into play and Moldova is at risk after Ukraine, it just doesn't end.
Exactly.
It's in the West's best interest to not completely demolish Russian forces and allow Russia propaganda to paint a more desperate picture which benefits Putin.
The best way is attrition, erode Russians trust in Putin and financially / politically bring Russia to its knees.
