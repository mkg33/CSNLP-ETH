The freedom caucus has no intention of governing our nation or working with anyone who doesn’t agree with their agenda.
They just want to blow everything up and remake our country in their sick, twisted vision.
The legislation that Biden and the democrats delivered will help every state and every citizen in our country.
The infrastructure bill, the chips bill, the inflation reduction act including lower prescription drug prices for seniors and the climate bill will bring jobs to boost the economy in all states.
There was a time when both parties would have supported these bills.
How is this a weaponized agenda?
If being woke means that I am more willing to help those less fortunate, support women’s rights, respect disabled people and appreciate their struggles, realizing racism is a problem, or wanting a comprehensive immigration plan then I am proud to be woke.
I want solutions to real problems not hate filled culture wars or a government that takes rights away from women.
The freedom caucus is a joke.
Whose freedom are they talking about, I would assume white republican males and women who like men to boss them around and take away their reproductive rights.
People in this country made their voice known in this election that they want democracy and want an end to the extreme agenda of the current Republican Party.
If Republicans win the house it is only because of gerrymandering.
