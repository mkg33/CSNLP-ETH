Last point I have time to make, thinking that just because someone is rehabbed they won’t commit crime anymore or murder is not only wishful thinking it’s wrong.
Especially when you’re not punishing them at all for what they’re doing.
People are already likely to be a repeat offender with harsh penalties, take away penalties altogether?
Lol.
Look at rehab for addiction, it’s more likely to relapse than not.
Violent offenders are way more likely than anyone else to recidivate after release.
Violent offenders recidivated at a higher rate than non-violent offenders.
Over 60 percent (63.8%) of violent offenders recidivated by being rearrested for a new crime or for a violation of supervision conditions.
Anyway good talk man.
I wish incarceration wasn’t necessary, I really do, and I advocate for rehab in all cases except for violent crimes that end in mutilation or death.
Retribution.
Which is a perfectly valid desire for a victim.
You are espousing it as fact that criminal justice should only be about rehab.
That is not true.
