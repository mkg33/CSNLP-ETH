New Gorbachev?
10% approval rating in his country and he had a coup before Putin did while Putin is threatening nuclear war and a famine to the world.
Won’t hold.
Now, rational decisions require rational informational inputs to be good decisions.
It is anyone's guess whether Putin currently has that right now.
He maybe has unintentionally built himself an information bubble and certainly didn't have good information when he decided to invade Ukraine.
Many have written and youtubed at lenh about Putin's decision making process and his information sphere (Vlad Vlexler plug) so I will elaborate no further.
I hope no one reads this and gets scared because, take heart, we are all going to die anyways.
Putin transfers power internally?
Who will be friendlier than Putin?
Alexander bortnikov the poisoner, Sergey Naryskin the other poisoner, maybe someone from military like Sergei Shoigu (who played a major role in annexing Crimea)?
An oligarch steeped in corruption?
Where does the progressive and western friendly leader emerge from because the whole country has distrusted the west for generations and they’re all suffering from sanctions and watching their bridges be attacked.
