Their whole country seems like it’s based on cynicism and shallow moral grandstanding.
They claim to have a moral high ground over the “decadent” West, but they have rampant alcoholism, physical abuse, and intolerance towards anyone different.
Everything is made to benefit to top echelons of their society, and corruption and lies reign over the country.
Russia is a country that has turned into some sort of nightmare, and it’s shocking to see so many people eagerly buying into their ideology abroad.
It’s a festering wound slowly poisoning everything around it, and it’s a horrible shame.
That being said, you’re right that they brought this upon themselves; Putin and his regime have been supported by Russians all too willing to believe the comfortable lies.
Not necessarily.
It might be a deliberate sacrifice of untrained and badly armed mobiks to saturate defenses, and then more deliberate pushes by troops with increasingly more training until something breaks, or Putin croaks or nukes.
Which is the scenario everyone else must prepare for, just in case.
Russia has been using Facebook specifically and social media generally very strategically to advance its propaganda.
It preys on the hopes and fears of people without much education and without much ability to think for themselves.
The American Republican base have been the perfect, most fertile ground for that kind of fear mongering propaganda.
