I thought I replied to this.
I agree with literally all your points.
I was responding to someone claiming he didn't know what a hard day of work looked like.
I was specifically responding to someone that said "you're assuming he has a long day of work".
So yes my entire point is challenging the idea that he doesn't put in hard work.
Anyone that looks like that puts in a shit ton of hard work.
Dude is still a slimy lying piece of shit.
It's weird because I agree with you as far as the base morality goes, but to sort of devil's advocate salesmen like that: if you eat better, workout a lot, and chase that look, you'll probably end up healthier than you were prior if you were less active beforehand and 90% of people who even were naive enough to assume he wasn't on steroids or that they could look like that without them will still find remarkable satisfaction in their change in lifestyle.

Fake nattys have been around for a while.
