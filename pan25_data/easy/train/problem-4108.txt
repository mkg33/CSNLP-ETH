allowed the invasion.
Ukraine was unwilling/unable to help itself then, so Western troops would have to do the fighting which would have absolutely pissed Putin off as that would have been NATO forces attacking Russia.
And they've basically been at war since 2014, with Putin fomenting a full on insurgency in Crimea the whole time.
Crimea and the ensuing political fallout in Ukraine directly lead to Zelenskyy being elected.
Now Ukraine has a strong leader with a willing and able army, so the West can support them materially where that wasn't an option previously.
Propaganda.
Russia is a beauracratic state.

Sweden famously supported many Vietnamese when the USA invaded .
Unlike Denmark, Sweden also didn't take part in the holocaust of Iraqis in the Iraq war, the USA's reasons for which were as dishonest as Russia's for invading Ukraine.
