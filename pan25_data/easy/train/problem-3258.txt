Keeping them engaged and energized is going to be tricky, especially with the Dem structure that gives positions of power based on seniority.
It will require running younger candidates and raising their profile within the party.
It can be done, but will it?
After someone sent Trump clips of the debate, the former president called Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel that night and floated the possibility of nixing his endorsement of Lombardo, according to The Times.
Like… i read both of your links.
Im not aware nor have i ever been aware of any “seniority” system.
In addition, the first link is an opinion piece from 2006 whereas the other one is 5 years old with a mention of a reliance on seniority sometimes but not like its a concrete part of the party “platform” or something.
ive existed 37 years on this earth and you're the first person to ever mention this idea of seniority as it is some concrete business model/plan that 1 party uses when putting people in roles with responsibility.
Like a research article studying cause/effects does not inherently mean this is some weird and odd system at all... at this point im not even sure what my own argument is, im just confused, and still find it odd how someone can go.
