Capitalism is a fluid conceptual socio-political economic system.
One of its key components is Perfect Competition, which is an exact concept in economic science.
All economists today recognises that Perfect Competition on its own creates Externalities, which have serious negative effects on society.
Externalities include behaviour which you described as being being due to wrong incentives.
All economists today closely study proven ways of successfully neutralising these Externalities, and these methods generally form a part of their advice to government when combining these methods in the governmental system, usually called some form of Capitalism.
Yeah, so?
They're still responsible for their actions.
"Someone else would've done it" isn't much of an excuse.
Like... Yeah!
Then they would be responsible, for their actions.
ah... actually, capitalism is just one of many socio-economic systems studied by economists and other social scientists.
it turns out the better focus is to evolve a better better of economic growth.
This has also been studied for a very long time.
