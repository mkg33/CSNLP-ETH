Are you kidding me?
You could hit 3 intruders with 1 shell.
If people are breaking in it’s gonna be dark, it’s not going to be like a shooting range with a red target on the guys head.
This just tells me you aren’t actually a gun person.
The ATF banned bump stocks by essentially ignoring basic reality and redefining law to suit their agenda, bypassing Congress and becoming their own unelected, unaccountable legislative body.
Why not both?
Gun values correlate with bullion value as they both have to do with supply and demand, as well as how strong the dollar and the economy is, and do better during times of economic, political, and civil unrest.
Just different asset classes for portfolio diversification.
No it does not.
Per federal law a machine gun is a firearm that can fire more than one cartridge per action of the trigger.
A bump stock does not make that possible, it just uses the recoil of the gun to help the shooter pull the trigger faster than normal.
A firearm with a bump stick still requires one action of the trigger even if it looks like it's firing very fast.
