Our governments honestly seem to be pretty understanding of it, it's mostly commenters with little knowledge or understanding of geopolitics throwing a strop.
Western powers aren't going to be jeopardising their security (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, British and French arms and security deals went to diversify India away from Russian arms, which have been rather successful, etc) and economic deals with India because India was neutral and bought energy below market from Russia.
Generally, we tend to understand neutral states buying and selling to both sides (Sweden didn't exactly become a diplomatic and economic pariah after WWII), and given India is buying energy and not selling technologies to Russia to circumvent sanctions meant to cripple Russia's ability to rebuild it's lost planes, tanks, missile stocks, etc, it's really been behaving relatively well from their perspective.
They'd prefer India not to, but they don't really expect India to kowtow to Western desires.
Pretty disingenuous answer.
OP is clearly talking about the fact that India very well may be cut off from western arms in the future given their “self interest” in supporting Russia.
