Of course now in my 50's I know that I didn't know shit, and most of my opinions were based on fucking nothing, or just what I heard randomly somewhere that sounded cool or whatever...but I still like the idea of engaging, rather than alienating the young.
I never experienced that.
I like the idea that things could be done better, and let's give it a try.
Takes a little trust, but the alternative is what?
Excellent idea.
Every time a new cohort is given the vote government looks after and provides for that cohort better.
Right off the bat 16 year olds deserve and need a much better education and introduction to the workplace than they currently get.
So many other things too.
Also, this argument can be used against all other groups of people not subject to the full set of adult responsibilities: lots of people are unable to go on jury duty (illiteracy, extreme views, mental issues), military duty (old people, physical disabilities), or receive favorable court sentences (old people, pardoned convicts).
Should a state strip voting rights away from all these people?
Where do we draw the line on who's a "true adult" and who's not?
