Not what I've heard of, so far it's mainly (only?)
Iran and North Korea.
Perhaps China covertly sends it to Russia through NK but I'd think USA is watching this closely because they would love to show proof that China provides Russia with weapons.
China knows that this would look extremely bad in the eyes of the west, whom they are trying to groom and soften.
China supports Russia because they can't afford a democracy to grow there, it would be absolutely catastrophic to Xi and the gang.
They don't like that Ukraine is moving closer towards the west but sending weapons to perhaps give Russia the edge is risky.
So far they bet that Putin and Kremlin is untouched for many years to come and hence they don't feel the need to help Russia (other than with words), because regardless who wins the war they believe Russia will stay Russia (meaning a completely apathetic population).
Pilot error?
Theyre in a military plane, not out on a day trip taking the wrong turn.
Even if this could be the case, maybe this would force them to be more careful in a flying weapon.
