While I agree that UBI should not be a method of gutting other safety nets, I do not agree that means testing is a particularly effective solution.
We know that there are more people who need assistance than don’t.
We also know that creating a system for means testing costs money.
We also know that means testing is often how conservatives inject reactionary and regressive policies into safety nets.
(drug testing, banning certain foods from food stamps, etc.)
Similarly, means testing is a common rhetorical cudgel used against free college, as in “why should the government pay for rich people to XYZ” which ignores the fact that those with money do not care about free state school or the government sending them a (relatively speaking) tiny check in the mail.
Means testing is much more likely to waste money create roadblocks for folks who need assistance than it is to save money by not sending it to the much smaller number of rich people.
