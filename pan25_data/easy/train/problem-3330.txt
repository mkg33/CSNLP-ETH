So yes, the war will likely drag on, especially with how Russia is attempting to “dig in” to solidify their current gains.
There is economic damage being done, and that will be worse with more recent drops in energy prices, but by and large their population seems willing to accept the necessary privations to continue the struggle.
How long they can ultimately continue is likely to be dependent on how quickly they deplete their existing stockpiles and how much of their manufacturing capacity can be diverted to wartime material production.
Whoa that was harsh.
Lmao I wonder why people come from all over the world for a education here in the US.
We have the best colleges in the world.
Your comment was asinine.
Sanctions were crucial in degrading Russia’s combat and industrial manufacturing power, diminishing their ability to operate their war machine at “full tilt”, but the depth of their cold-war stockpiles and the necessity of continuing imports of gas/oil for Europe gave them flexibility in that and a ton of financial ammo to prop up their currency and pivot their economy away from international markets.
