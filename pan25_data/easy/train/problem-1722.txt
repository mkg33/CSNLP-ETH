I strongly suspect that this invasion had little to do with Russia's geopolitical position and more to do with a delicate balance of power within Russia.
Almost all of Russia's actions since the start of the invasion make very little sense from a geopolitical perspective.
However, if you instead look at these decisions from the perspective of warring factions within an authoritarian government ruling over a country that is on an unsustainable trajectory (shrinking population and shrinking economy, and with too much corruption to turn the ship around), they may begin to make a certain amount of sense.
No thats wrong.
First of all if they didn’t invade, the western world would continue to include russia in as much as it’s acceptable because thats how you get good relations and change russia in the next 50 years.
Also this is a myth, russia need the crim for trading in winter but the natural gases are just there and will be nice for russia but it wasnt a portion to start this war at all.
Putin talks about this since 20 years, he thinks ukraine belongs to russia.
