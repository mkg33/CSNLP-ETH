Tesla had the advantage of being first mover in that market.
There was crap all competition.
Two really smart guys invented a pretty good concept that Musk bought.
The major car companies had only given lip service to electric cars until Tesla.
People have increasingly WANTED a good EV.
Tesla showed that.
Tesla’s problem is now they have awakened the giants.
The major car companies are going to crush Tesla with their 100+ years of manufacturing, supply chain, and quality experience.
Tesla’s have some really good points, like range, but they have serious quality, production, and supply chain problems.
Kia and Hyundai ALREADY make a very competitive EV that beats Tesla’s in several areas.
BMW/Audi, the US Big 3, Mercedes, etc are all coming out with EVs that will, in time surpass Tesla.
Tesla’s days are going to be numbered unless they invest HEAVILY in basic manufacturing, quality, and supply chain.
Musk is too busy pissing off the main demographic that wants and will put up with Tesla’s crap quality and delivery problems.
That demographic will be looking at those new products, and probably buy them.
