Most likely mass immigration (think how Germany lets anyone with a degree in if they can get a job offer, only without the excessive bureaucracy) combined with aggressive housing construction/permitting reform.
The remittances and reduction of pressure on developing countries should cause wage growth and investment to spread outward and would provide a source of revenue to offset the population of refugees and asylum seekers that have been the main sources of non-European migration.
Yes.
The detonation of some 2000+ nuclear devices since 1945 has littered the atmosphere and surface of Earth with radioactive isotopes.
Steel production requires massive amounts of oxygen, so those radioactive isotopes inevitably find their way in.
Yep.
That asshole is then going to sell those rare earth metals to someone to make devices like the one you're currently using to post to Reddit, and the copper to someone who will make wires like the ones currently providing you electricity.
Hell, some of them may be used in the deep-sea exploration devices that are the only way we know anything about many of those "underwater geological features and the amazing life that they host".
Pollution and environmental destruction are bad, but you should probably have looked around at all the glass in your home before casting that "asshole" stone.
