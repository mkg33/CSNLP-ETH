Okay!
I think somebody finally made a point that I can see happening.
I think you're totally correct.

I remember when Libertarians were about skepticism of big government (military spending, PATRIOT Act, War on Terror, anti-interventionism, skepticism of the Federal Reserve) and yes, skeptical of wealth inequality itself (insofar as asset prices were propped up by corrupt politicians and federal reserve policies).
No.
Communism was the FACADE of the USSR.
Both Lenin and Stalin pretended to be communists to gain popular support.
They did not set up a communist or even socialist state.
They set up a fascist dictatorship where most of the people lived in poverty and the "Communist" party leadership lived like the Czar and the nobles that came before them, in palaces and in great wealth, and don't you dare question them because they'll kill anyone who questions them.
I agree with you that Communism can never be achieved at a national level, and it was never achieved at a national level anywhere.
The USSR didn't even try.
They went directly to fascism when Lenin took power by force from the provisional government.
