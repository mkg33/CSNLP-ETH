Yeah, he's fooked.
Republican leaders sure never wanted him to usurp their power or plans, but sucked it up to keep the crumbs he left them.
His crimes are too outrageous to stand, Putin doesn't have a way to funnel him cash and he can't help Putin anymore anyway, Jews know he's a Nazi now, women always knew he was repugnant, his daughter and son in law took their Saudi money and ran, his weird allies are gonna all end up in prison before him, someone out there has the Epstein files, conservative media is dumping his ass because of any combination of the above and because he's openly threatened them with Truth Social, he's a loser, the judges he appointed were part of the machine before he arrived and don't need him anymore, he hasn't created a hit meme in ages so he's just replaying bad versions of his hits, his dementia is overtaking him, he's just a fat old irrelevant loser in ridiculous makeup now, his supposed financial success is about to be exposed as a lie, and he doesn't look good on tv anymore.
But this is a win win.
If he runs as R, they lose.
If he runs as an independent, R loses even more.
If he bows out of the race, or fails to win, his protection is gone.
Trump will be humiliated politically first and then convicted.
What I fear is that heâ€™ll have a heart attack first.
