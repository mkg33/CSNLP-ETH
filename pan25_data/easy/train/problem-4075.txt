Hmmm......I was telling my son last night how all of her neighbors hate Mother Russia and I also explained the reasons why.
Basically, it's about past hegemony.
Okay, I think that's too kind of a definition.
Make it aggression, bullying, exploitation, and in some cases outright theft of wealth.
I think that explains it.
China will never recognise Siberian independence.
China and Russia are key strategic partners, their cooperation particularly in trade and security is only increasing, especially post full-scale invasion.
There is zero incentive for China to do that.
Unfortunately, this is the only realistic scenario, IMO, where nuclear weapons could be used by Russia without international intervention.
True.
Although it provides yet another talking point for pro-Russian networks to amplify.
This isn’t very significant in Russia as you say but there are definitely people in Western countries that are anti-war which Russia happily targets with its disinformation campaigns.
This certainly does make a difference as governments are less likely to send Ukraine military support if it’s politically unpopular (especially tanks and now jets).
Moreover, we tend to see the conflict in terms of the West and Russia, but there are a lot of states with more indifferent positions, particularly in Africa.
It would only help Russia gain sympathy in these countries.
Why give Russia an easy win in the information war?
Interesting.
Tell us more.
Does Siberia have the means to establish a self sustaining nation?
Can they avoid becoming a mini Russia run by oligarchs?
If they can form a country will fossil fuels be the primary export or do they have wood, rare earth minerals and/or other valuable resources?
