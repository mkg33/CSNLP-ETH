Design mandated by Congress to be done with Space Shuttle parts, throwing out reusable parts and building a hydrolox rocket in an age of methane rockets is straight out of the 1980s.
When other science missions are ready, SLS will have Starship in its competiion and possibly New Glenn from Blue Origin, both modern methane powered rockets that don't have the same problems as hydrogen powered rockets like SLS do.
I imagine there were similar questions back in the Mercury days, where it was understood that you would need to dock together two space ship modules launched on independent rockets at orbital speeds.
This means in total we might see those 5 SLS launches, before switching to Starship, which can do the asteroid missions, deep space science missions, etc.
because it's designed for it.
I half convinced that this disclosure around NASA and other government funded science projects are just a psy-ops by the Medical and Pharmaceutical industries, and the Neo-Liberals to move the blame for the failure of American healthcare and social programs from them to the public funding that could actually help people.
