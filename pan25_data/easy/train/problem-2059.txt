“…the latest shootdown of an unidentified object on Sunday by an F-16 fighter jet took two sidewinder missiles - after one of them failed to down the target, a U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.”.
VanHerck: Yeah, absolutely.
There was a warhead in the missile.
You can see that explosion on TV as it goes through the lower part of the balloon and right there through the superstructure.
International waters.
That balloon had already traveled thousands of miles.
The reason they shot it down literally as it cleared the beach is a.)
shallow water recovery, and more importantly b.)
if it lands in international waters we can’t touch it.
We needed to make sure it was down on US soil (so to speak).
B is an oversimplification, but we didn’t want the Chinese to have a semi legitimate argument that we wouldn’t be allowed to recover it.
Basically they couldn’t afford to let the thing come down slowly.
The US military has actually recovered parachuting objects mid-flight.
Back in the 1950s, if you wanted to take photos by satellite you'd need to retrieve the physical film in some way.
They eventually came up with a concept for a spy satellite with a hardened film canister.
Once all the photos were taken, it would eject the canister for reentry.
The canister would fall to about 60,000 feet and deploy a parachute, which would allow it to be caught in mid-air by a specially modified C-119.
I believe they had a steel "net" and a set of winches.
Look up the CORONA satellites for more information.
