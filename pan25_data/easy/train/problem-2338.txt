Yanks are keen to forget they dragged most of Europe into their Iraq massacre.
They constantly want their arses kissed for world war 2 but seem to have very selective amnesia of the past twenty years.
Are you one of those?
Iran (britian’s fault) why iraq went to war with kuwait and fought Iran (britian’s fault) Reason Afghanistan is the situation it was (Russia’s fault) Reason most African nations are not a vibrant capitalistic nations founded in trade (britian’s, France, German, italian, Spanish, Portuguese fault), why Somalia is so fucked up (Italy, Russia, India, China, Korean, I forget the other one that fucked it up in the 90s fault).
The state shouldn't be allowed to kill its citizens.
Nobody gets a free pass on killing.
Such is the European logic.
We make mistakes aswell and have to free people that have been in prison for decades.
But we sure as hell doesn't kill anyone.
Europe has a long and rich history.
We don't blame the US for being what it is.
WW2 was especially horrible for human rights in Europe, and I guess we still feel it today.
How should we move forward?
Killing is wrong.
The death penalty has never helped as a deterrent.
It is pointless.
