Although their Air Force suffers from the same problems of corruption and failure of maintenance similar to the rest of their armed forces; their newer fighters are quite capable.
If Ukraine had more of an Air Force I think it would be interesting to see how the Russians fared in air-to-air combat.
Also it would be interesting to see how effective Russian air defense is against The f-16s that would be the most likely platform that we would give Ukraine.
As it is they are using most of their s300s to attack ground targets.
Presumably due to a lack of airborne targets.
That said the US as well as other NATO allies have equipped the Ukrainians with very good surface to air defenses.
This has denied Russian air superiority over Ukraine.
They have basically backed off of even trying to use their Air Force for close air support.
The expected losses are not worth the attempt.
They likely can't replace their aircraft due to the tech embargo and thus will only commit them at the most critical time.
They would much rather use cheap Iranian drones.
I think one of the lessons that this war will teach us is that air defenses have grown so capable that sending expensive manned fighters has become uneconomical.
Cheap drones are going to be the way of the future.
Last time Russia had an attempted coup in 1993 the military was called in and decided to open fire, since Putin entered office the Russian government has built large amounts of paramilitary police forces excluding the standard police who we see break up riots and the Russian military is still happy to butcher “traitors”, so attempting a coup would just be a mass suicide attempt and the Russian people know it.
They know it so well that there are many Russian jokes about doing as you are told and not criticising the state otherwise you disappear.
