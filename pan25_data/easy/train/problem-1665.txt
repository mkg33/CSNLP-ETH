Sorry, but that is an immature remark.
Hungary would be a weaker ally for Western countries than Turkey.
To claim otherwise is ridiculous.
NATO is a serious organisation that provides mutual defence in the face of national threats.
I understand that Turkey appears to be a dictatorship-ruled evil country, but NATO existed long before Erdogan, and Turkey had been a member for a long time before other countries joined.
Erdogan will leave tomorrow, and Turkey will return to normalcy.
No major NATO member country will even consider risking the possibility of Turkey leaving the organisation because Turkey holds such an important strategic position for every other European nation.

Kicking a member out because they use their right to veto makes no sense, then what's the point of having the right to begin with?
Honestly?
No.
The US Navy and air force are so insane and the Pacific so large I can't see anyone attempting it.
China would be content to win a decisive victory in the south China sea and simply kick the US out I think.
