I looked it up from another article and apparently the capsule here contains Cs-137 which is very radioactive but not emitting neutrons.
If it's a gauge they usually use them for measuring densities of other materials, essentially you know how many gamma particles your isotope is creating and you measure how many you get from a detector on the other side of what you are measuring.
Cs-137 emits betas and gammas, the betas don't have a lot of energy and can't travel very far, it's likely that they don't even leave whatever capsule is around the Cs itself.
The gammas are more important, they don't have enough energy to cause a nucleus to change but they can deposit energy that causes DNA and cell damage.
Luckily cars are usually pretty good gamma shields and distance is also a really good shield so people driving by quickly probably don't need to worry too much, just don't pick up random crap off that highway until they find the thing.
Definitely.
Not being able to find it would be a really bad thing, and half life just means average 5xrays worth of energy in 30 years.
Radiographer here.
Ten times xrays ain't that much.
It's not great but it's not terrible.
Also depending on the kind of radiation being emited then most of it may be absorbed by the air within just a couple of metres.
