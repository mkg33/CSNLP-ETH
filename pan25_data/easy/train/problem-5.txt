Its all profeteering and simple economics, headlines and people trying to make it deeper than it is.
Every country does it and as much as “2 wrongs dont make a right” sounds good to hear its not the world we live in.
Everybody gotta eat.
Another example would be the west turning to ‘sustainable energy’ and condemning China, India, and other nations for pollution while their whole Industrial Revolution for the last 200 years has already taken its toll, not to mention outsourcing the ‘dirty mining jobs’ ya’ll need for the Tesla batteries to Africa and then have the gall to say “Oh look at those dirty polluting pigs”.
I don't really see the issue.
Russia gets screwed economically by being forced to sell at a crap price, Europe gets the oil it needs and India makes some money.
It's a loss for Russia and a win for everyone else involved.
Every other country is not supporting genocidal empires, that threaten nuclear annihilation every 5 seconds.
Or does India think, that if shit goes down, there won't be any consequences for their country?
