Sending stuff to Russia for a few months is what bothers you?
They have been sending weapons to Hezbollah, the Huthis, Hamas, PIJ and other terror organizations for decades.
You woke up late.
Imagine if this ended up being a co-ordinated attack by Israel, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and Kurdistan with each taking out one facility.
That's good.
They should fight it out already.
Rest of the world should just let their stupid religions go at it.
Stop the slow burn, just go to town.
Iran already supports the ongoing war against Israel by supplying Palestinian terrorists with weapons, but engaging in open war would bring the US into the conflict directly, which Iran doesn’t want.
Nobody else will get involved because (1) western countries tacitly support Israel here because they are neutralizing an enemy’s weapon supply, and (2) Iran’s allies won’t risk a broader conflict over something minor like this.
Most of the Middle East won’t get involved because they hate Israel and Iran, but view Iran as the greater threat.
