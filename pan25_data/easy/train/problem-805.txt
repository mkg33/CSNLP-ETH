Are you saying that gun owners don’t want to or it’s simply just too hard for gun owners to follow the laws?
Wake up.
Guns owners aren’t America’s finest quality of citizen.
Yup.
We already have an entire federal agency whose job it is supposed to be going after the people at the root of gun crime, but they're on a perpetual fool's errand for things that even those agents do not believe should be regulated at all (or at most treated like any other gun transfer with background check etc).
Good.
These people?
These fucking people?
Have you met these people?
It’s not like they were registers their guns anyway - it’s there right.
We need to have a giant iron pour, where anyone can just throw it in and melt them down.
> Previously, because of the carry permit requirement, any handgun owner who wanted to bring their weapon into a public space had to go through an eligibility screening, register fingerprints and undergo four to six hours of training, in addition to passing a written exam and shooting proficiency test, the Texas Department of Public Safety website states.
After HB1927 goes into effect on Sep. 1, those Texans will no longer need that permit or the training that went with it.
