Interesting.
I feel like many conservatives that I know have convinced themselves that done of the stuff is true or it simply doesn’t matter to them.
My own family has said things and dismissed things that I thought would be a breaking point for them.
For example, we live in Georgia so we saw a lot of campaign ads about Herschel Walker including his abortion story and domestic violence story.
My family wasn’t phased at all and said that was still better than being a Democrat.
I have no idea how to get through to people like that.
Extremists aside, what percentage of Republican politicians secretly support abortion?
Even if they don't say it publicly?
