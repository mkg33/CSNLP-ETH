"Assault weapon" has no meaning.
It's the rate of fire that makes something "military grade" and the semi-auto function improves NOTHING in the guns performance EXCEPT its ability to kill the maximum number of people in the minimum amount of time.
Good for military applications, totally wrong and unnecessary for any civilian use.
So no then?
You have never owned or fired a gun before, nor taken any safety/training courses.
So you really really really really have no ground to stand on.
Not saying there's bad guys on every block, it's like an airbag in a car.
Never expect to use mine, never want to have to use mine, but when the shit hits the fan, I'm damn happy I have it than not.
Also what's wrong with mental health evaluations, stricter background checks, and holding police departments liable for any red flag law violators that commit a gun related offense?
