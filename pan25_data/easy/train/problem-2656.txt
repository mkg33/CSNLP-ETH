It may work actually.
Russia can continue missile attacks indefinitely, while Ukraine isn’t allowed to return the favor.
Certainly the Russian population is used to miserable living conditions so they are immune to hardships induced by sanctions.
Weeelllllllll they would mobilize everybody if China invaded.
Right now they don’t really have saving their country’s existence as the true mission, despite Putin’s fantasies and paranoia.
Exactly.
They can pull out of Ukraine and continue the missile and drone attacks for years.
They are safe behind their borders as long as Ukraine is denied long range weapons.
Interesting question.
I don't know if he really orders any crimes or military activity or whatnot, he's a diplomat, his job is just to lie Russia's lies 24/7.
I don't think that he can be charged with crimes against humanity since he's just a talking head, plus he may have diplomatic immunity.
In Russia, he'd only face consequences if he doesn't lie hard enough.
Any realistic successor to Putin will probably more or less stay Russia's incredibly stupid course.
Hell, they might even keep Lavrov on, because there aren't many people out there that can just tell ridiculous lies with a straight face day in day out like he does.
