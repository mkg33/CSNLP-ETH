There's a saying in Russia- “Обама нассал в подъезде” translates to “Obama pissed in the porch” which obv means to blame the west for whatever whenever.
I felt like everyone should know this.

One day, if chaos grows out of control even for Putin and Medvedev, these three countries will be in danger - but the UK is a bit safer as they have nuke, while Poland will also be bit safer than Germany, as Germany is further geographically and more important for the EU/NATO, thus creating more of a psychological effect.
They still do.
It is a shadow of former self, but Russia still hosts talented people I admire.
I stopped reading anything Russian because I don’t want to give money to this regime, used to buy tons of ebooks from their online stores.
This war sucks on so many levels.
Before they invaded Ukraine they were spreading the propaganda that Nazi Ukraine was killing Russians and Russian culture (true, there are extremism and corruption in Ukraine - but if this could be considered a valid excuse to attack a country, Russia would have been eliminated a long time ago), Ukraine is an artificial state etc.
