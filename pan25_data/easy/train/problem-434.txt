I agree with most of your points except for the highly religious part...only a few of the Chinese Canadians I know are highly religious?
Most are still atheist since they grew up with no religion.
But, perhaps that may depend on the local communities, I can see some areas being more religious than others.
Although it may also be possible that not everyone goes to church events is actually religious.
When I was a kid my friend (one of the few religious Chinese people I know) invited me to her church events and I happily went but I definitely am atheist.
Many Chinese people are well connected within their own communities so I could see the church spreading the word about events happy to have more people come and people showing up even if they aren't necessarily religious themselves.
Oh god this.
It hurts my feelings that you don't recognize our ability to claim other countries as our own.
It hurts my feelings that you question our ability to own the ocean.
It hurts my feelings that you ask about our human rights record .
It's like you called them fat or something.
