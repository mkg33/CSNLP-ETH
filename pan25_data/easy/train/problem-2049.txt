I don't want to hear about MS being anything but anti-consumer after turning Starfield into an exclusive title immediately after purchasing Bethesda despite it being a multiplatform game for most of it's development.
And I definitely don't want to hear it after their plans on making TES6 exclusive as well.
I'm not saying Sony isn't anti-consumer, all of these companies are, but Sony hasn't done anything that bad ever when it comes to exclusivity.
All of their exclusive IPs were built from the ground up on their own platform and made by studios they effectively built themselves.
Spider-Man is the only exception to that but even then that IP was more or less dead (as a video game IP) before Sony revived it, along with the fact that MS had the opportunity to take that IP themselves and turned it down.
Right?
I may eat crow down the road, but I really hope this merger goes thru.
Anything to get Bobby from Blizzard is an instant win in my book.
What happened was the verdict was overturned on appeal, because the original judge broke ethical guidelines during the trial by commenting about it publicly on TV, and the new administration washed their hands of the affair - because they rightly realized that they had no way to win, because due to the highly public nature of the trial there was no longer anyone untainted by the original trial.
Wow how generous.
Let us know when they offer those titles without the caveat of allowing GP to dominate the entire market unabated.
There's a reason they were only offering it on GP and not just allowing it on the PS store which Sony has no issue with (see: The Outer Worlds and Minecraft).
They said no to MS games being offered on PS as GP exclusives.
They've had zero issue allowing MS games on PS through the store (Outer Worlds and Minecraft).
