It's something I've been trying to figure out myself.
I think a huge part of why minorities, black people, gay people, any group of people who is not a rich white straight man would vote Republican now is because they straight up don't understand the history of the party realignments in this country.
They 'do their own research' and read history about Conservatives who called themselves Democrats doing shitty things like giving us the KKK, and then they blame Liberals who call themselves Democrats today, because they don't understand what a party realignment is in part because there's a huge GOP propaganda campaign to make sure they don't understand it.
So, the ideology that gave us the KKK and nearly 100 years of Jim Crow successfully rebranded itself.
They don't fool most people, obviously, but the fact that they can fool as many as they do infuriates the hell out of me.
It's inevitable.
Republicans have gerrymandered districts to favor them.
They have election-deniers placed in positions of power at the State level and staffing local voting locations.
And they have a Supreme Court that will enable their power-grabs.
