From the video, when Zelensky was asked about his role in history, it was described as “he wants to finish this cycle of oppression and subjugated that Russia has pursued for generations.
He doesn’t want just to have a temporary truce or armistice that allows Russia to rearm, re-entrench and try again.
He really wants to break the cycle so Russia never attacks Ukraine again, so that it remains a free independent and sovereign country.”.

It's a fucking trifecta for the troll farms.
I don't see this brought up as much as it should be (it shouldn't be, really, but we are talking about terrible people here, to be clear).
Russian energy resources obviously had became undesirable in Western World (EU/NATO/Australia etc.
), but some developing countries, for example, Pakistan, India and the similar ones do not care about tensions in Europe and see no problem in buying stuff from Russia.
So Russia would be able to partially compensate losses from Europe, although it's unclear to what extent.
Kinda interesting.
I think Rosgvardiya is one of Putins best defenses against a guy like Prigozhin being able to move on him, so unfortunately taking out Rosgvardiya (or zolotov, putins buddy who controls it) might just make it easier for Prigozhin and a new Wagner paramilitary turning Russia into an even worse place.
Still, if they can hit Zolotov, they can probably hit Prigozhin too.
Yeah ie always maintained that Prigozhin will not be ousting Putin when it inevitably appears on these threads.
My point only being that Rosgvardiya is Putins first line of defense against any challengers, and crippling them would definitely make his position more precarious.
It's certainly not likely though.
Even if Zolotov was taken out, Putin will have contingencies in place to have another loyalist take charge.
