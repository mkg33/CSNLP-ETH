Considering how things went for Republicans on Tuesday, I have no doubt that without the new gerrymandered districts, Democrats would have expanded their majority.
I would say the Democrats regain control of the house since the districts Republicans drew mostly contain older voters who are not vaccinated and also in a shrinking demographic.
Imagine how many they would have if the House wasn't artificially capped at 435 members.
California alone would ensure that the Republicans would never have control of the chamber.
