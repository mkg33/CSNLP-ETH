None of it is acceptable.
I've got a buddy who accidentally took home from work one inconsequential but technically classified document.
He immediately discovered his mistake when he got home and called his boss to ask what to do.
He spent six months in court, got convicted with three years probation, lost his security clearance for life, and had to pay a large fine.
So why is it all "a-ok" for these politicians as long as they play nice?
And why isn't Trump, who did far, far worse, not sitting in a prison cell?
(Yeah, those are rhetorical questions, I know why).
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
