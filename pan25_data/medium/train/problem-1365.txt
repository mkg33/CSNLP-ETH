I believe there was a recent article on The Hill highlighting increased American credit card debt due to higher prices with wages not keeping pace.
Of course, it’s happening while interest rates on these cards are increasing at the highest rate in decades, so people buying groceries on credit are getting double screwed.
Which is absolutely bonkers since less than 2 years ago e hit record low levels of personal debt and record levels of individual savings.
In two years we have gone from people having more disposable income than ever to record debt levels.
Yeah but that at least has the fig leaf of trying to prevent a full depression.
There’s some kind of economic theory behind it rather than strictly greed.
For real though, it’s like business schools stopped teaching people how to competently and sustainably grow their businesses.
They refuse to reinvest in talent, R&D, process improvements, etc.
It’s stock buybacks and cutting corners and nothing else.
At what point do we end the incompetence?
