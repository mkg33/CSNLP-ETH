“We had witnessed 9/11, the terrorist attack in New York and the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania and the so-called plane that crashed into the Pentagon.
It’s odd there’s never any evidence shown for a plane in the Pentagon.
But anyways, I won’t—I’m not going to dive into the 9/11 conspiracy.
But 9/11 had happened.
Our country was very much into a war.”.
Wait what is the actual conspiracy here that MTG believes?
That there was a plane crash into the pentagon on 9-11, or that there was a crash but somehow they don't have any evidence of the plane left?
AA Flight 77 definitely crashed into the pentagon so I'm just curious where the mystery is?
