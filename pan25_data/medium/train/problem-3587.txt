Despite the opposition’s rhetoric, nothing in the language of the proposition steers money toward Lyft, said Bill Magavern, policy director for the Coalition for Clean Air, which backed Prop 30.
“That is a hoax that was perpetrated by the opposition.
There was nothing in there to favor a special interest.”.
Someone who drives for Lyft right now is eligible for a rebate to buy an EV like anyone else, said Magavern.
“The measure would not have changed that.”.

The headline is misleading.
Newsom opposed it because it would benefit Lyft-- instead of taxpayers-- who then wouldn't have to electrify 90% of their miles by 2030 as part of the green deal.
Also, polling was pretty close for "yes" and "no" as it stood, so that's not surprising.
What’s more, supporters say, it wasn’t Lyft but environmental groups that came up with the idea for the proposition, which they did long before the ride-hailing company got involved.
Plus, the money for vehicle rebates would have gone to the California Air Resources Board, or CARB, which regulates greenhouse gases, and the agency would then have discretion over how to spend it, Magavern said.
