Seems almost insultingly obvious to a Kiwi but a lot of people around the world don't know Kiwis are either a bird or New Zealanders.

Yeah, some shit will never go away.
I'm from Idaho.
I first heard the joke when I was too young to understand what a ho was so I was tired of it before I even knew what it meant.
I have heard so much crap from Aussies with enough of it not being intended to be funny that my automatic reaction is to want to nail someones tongue to a car door and drive that car through a brick wall.
Fortunately that urge passes quickly .
But, one thing I learned in my years is to let people have their stupid joys.
So, to all the people who have waited their entire lives to meet someone from Idaho, I'm right here.
Let me have it.
Let me be the ho so no other Idahoans have to.

A few years ago, this would have taken hours or days for me to find out about an earthquake in New Zealand while sitting here in Ohio.
Now I know within minutes of it happening thanks to Twitter alerts and Facebook posts from friends who are also watching news reports online as they happen.

I'm in the US, so I just read about it on Twitter.
Crazy how social media can bring you up to speed with what's happening across the world almost instantly.
