I really like this comment, but unfortunately I can't believe we are going to have another 20 year runway.
American democracy is in dire shape.
I'm pretty sure voting now or 2024 are what we have left.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
They'll still call it "democracy," but it will just be fascism wearing the democracy's death mask.
After that, voting will decrease as democracy goes into a death spiral, because at the point it truly becomes rational to say your vote doesn't matter (an impulse I definitely do not plan to ever acquiesce to, but can't deny will become logical), more people will stop voting.
Republicans have shown what they do when they have the power to change voting rules and keep themselves in power.
Look to Wisconsin, North Carolina, the same fight in Georgia playing out again.
They will find a way for roughly 50% of democratic voters to get 1/3rd or less of the representation.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
The country is the way it is because we let it be this way.
If you want change, vote today on forward and in 20 years, you will see the change.
