This war rages on because Russia canâ€™t walk away with zero gain, despite them being entitled to jack shit.
They will never get what they want aka Kiev.
They are trying to flip the script and get anything at all just to boast it as victory.
Except they aren't in the position to demand anything.
And Ukraine knows it.
Ukraine also knows that giving them anything is just inviting them to try this shit again the second they recover.
If you only pay half your lunch money to the school bully one day, you're still inviting him to try taking all of it tomorrow.
I watched the movie and thought it was actually pretty OK, but they really butchered the scene on the raft back on Earth where Valentina convinces Ender to return to the academy.
I loved the page in the book where he traps a wasp and crushes it while he's casually discussing that they're teaching him about pre-emptive strikes in military school.
I disagree that the whole series was amazing though.
It started to go off the rails after Enders Game and by Speaker For the Dead it was losing me.
Orscon Scott Card is a pretty weird dude actually, and Enders Game kind of looks like an anomaly in his career, in retrospect.
There's a theory Putin has a grudge with Ukraine because of historical reasons and Ukraine defiance.
He still sees it as a russian territory and Ukraine turning away from(or maybe not being controlled by) Russia is ideologically unacceptable for him.
