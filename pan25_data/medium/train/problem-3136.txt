Fun story: last time my wife and I got yelly with her parents was over student loan forgiveness.
My wife compared it to PPP loans (which, FIL's organization got one).
FIL said no that's different because the PPP loans were never intended to be paid back, to which I said oh so they were handouts.
He loved that one oh boy.
