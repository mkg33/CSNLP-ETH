It is, and we use it.
Spain's "native" population is decreasing really fast, and it's only the supply of new immigrants what keeps the population stable at 47 million.
I don't think their youth emigration has been quite as drastic as somewhere like Poland, but yes Schengen plays a major part.
If you want to research, the amount of facilities and available positions is very little.
Most research on Spain depend on public funding, which is to be honest quite deficient.
Your expenses can become x4-x5 too.
It has more to do with the amount of specialized jobs and research centres available outside of Spain.
Many high-skilled jobs simply either don't exist here, or pay low-skilled wages (which are extremely low for a Western European country).
The result is that people in certain fields (physics, chemistry, compsci, biology, etc) can't find a job in these areas, and instead look for jobs elsewhere in Western Europe.
The only reason (imo) this youth exodus isn't higher is because Spain has certain positive traits that are hard to give up, at least for someone who has been raised here.
