I think it's important that we don't commit the same folly that the Russians did when they invaded, forcing the facts to fit their narrative and refusing to believe their opponents could learn and change accordingly.
As example, the Russians managed to retreat from Kherson across a major river quietly and competently.
They still have a pro core of troops, plenty of equipment, and lots and lots of artillery.
So while sending 100 western tanks and 50 Bradleys is great and all, Ukraine is a big place and those numbers need to go up by a LOT.
The US has 2,000 Bradleys sitting in deep reserve just waiting to be decommissioned, I'd like to see us donate 500-1000 of them.
THAT would be a game changer.
They definitely would be.
This is actually the biggest problem for Ukraine since the war started.
Russia has shown the ability to absorb lots of losses and keep fighting.
Add in that Russia has nukes making their troops and equipment nigh invulnerable on Russian territory.
Ukraine has already beaten Russia, but they'll have to do it again with this new offensive.
And who knows how many times after that?
And each time at the cost of blood.
The only reason Ukraine hasn't given up already is that if they lose they face genocide.
They are in dire straits.
We should take note of this, especially when considering what additional help the West can offer.
Russia still has plenty of bite left and they aren't all a bunch of chowderheads, so let's get more aid flowing and plan the victory parades later.
