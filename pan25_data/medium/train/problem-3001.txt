Fun (well perhaps not so fun) fact, in the UK law states animal food needs to be safe for human consumption in case it ends up in human meals.
Personally given the state of the economy I'm surprised Brits aren't eating tories.
'Health' is very nebulous and varies.
E.g.
if you have diabetes, all instant noodles, all the time would be a bad idea.
But you are right in spirit.
I would (and have) bought reduced items and frozen them, eaten seasonally, eaten smaller amounts...not pet food.
as long as you are active, blood sugar is not too much of a problem, but if you have other ailments that stop you from being active, then you really have to watch the carbs.
Glucose is untaken into the muscles directly when you are active, so its a matter of timing if you want a heavy carb meal, i tend to have a meal and then cycle to the shops an hour after, by the time i have biked to the shop, walked around the shop, biked back home, my blood sugar will be back to base.
You're saying blood sugar isn't too much to worry about as long as your active, that's not true.
You are correct that glucose can be directly taken up by muscles, but that is missing the point/problem in DM2.
