I’m unsurprised by your lack of faith in IR theory.
I wonder though… why does the economy matter if you believe the Earth is gonna tank anyway?
You a “got-mine” kinda guy, or just an Austrian economist?
?
I think they’re hoping for a sub-national coalition on this.
Many US states are holding to environmental pledges even though the federal government has not in many regards.
I applaud them for doing that but unfortunately it only hurts their industries.
Unless the US, China, and India sign on to similar programs, it's useless.
Of course, China and India still make up a sizable portion of the deficit.
As with many other initiatives, I think the hope is to change the infrastructure and incentives until India and China (or at least their people) find it too costly to be an emitter.
The best way to leverage change is by building consensus, so every State’s commitment is significant.
Soft power works wonders.
Good thing is, the vast majority of bureaucrats and diplomats agree with me.
So we’ll tank the economy and still burn to death by 2030.
Or the nukes, can’t wait to find out.
