If doing something about it loses more than it gains, there is no point, but relations can degrade.
That was the situation during Crimea.
The cost of doing something about it outweighed Ukraine's loss.
When Russia invaded the second time, things changed as Putin's intentions were more clear.
It wasn't only about control over the black sea, but Russia's intentions were to remove Ukraine as a culture entirely.
Allowing Putin to do that would forever alter international relations between all nations and risk the sovereignty of all nations too small to defend themselves.
Just create 10 generations of psychologically fucked up dedovshchina'd russian men and watch the societal issues and generational trauma fucking devastate russian society.
What makes Russia & it's people so consistently miserable throughout history compared to other large countries that have had major upheavals & dictators (I.e.
China), which at some point stabilized somewhat?
It's not like Russia lacks intelligent people who want better for themselves.
Was any hope for a positive upturn in Russian civilization killed when Stalin banished & cancelled Trotsky?
