> Rensselaer County's Republican elections commissioner abruptly resigned from his position on Wednesday, hours after the Times Union published a story online reporting that he is scheduled to plead guilty to federal criminal charges in January in connection with an ongoing voter fraud investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice.
“Democrat legislators Peter Grimm and Cindy Doran, the Legislature's minority leader and deputy minority leader, respectively, had issued a statement earlier Wednesday criticizing the legislators who had voted in favor of reappointing Schofield to his position two weeks ago.
Grimm and Doran were the only legislators who voted against the appointment when it passed 16-2.”.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
This, right here.
These motherfuckers commit so much voter fraud that they cannot see themselves losing.
And then they just can’t grok that a Democrat would get more votes than them, especially since they cheated, that they need to accuse the Dems of cheating.
It’s the only thing they know.
Not really "suddenly", the Fed AND the NY State Police have been known to be investigating the GOP in Rensselaer for months.
Search warrants, seized phones, etc.
Only when the guy pleads guilty do they actually act.
