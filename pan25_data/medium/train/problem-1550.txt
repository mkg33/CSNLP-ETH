A lot of Fox News’ revenue comes from the fact that it is bundled in most cable packages as “basic cable.” So if you subscribe to a cable service, you are bankrolling Fox News even if you don’t watch it.
It’s fair to criticize Hulu on this one, since it’s a similar idea.

People forget.. Disney said they support their employees in the Don't Say Gay debate.
Desantis didn't say anything.
Disney keeps its tax, bond and construction control and DeSantis gets to appoint some figureheads to a powerless commission.
But then Disney said they were stopping political donations and Desantis blew up over that.. no one screws with his kickbacks!
No reason Disney should.
Having defeated DeSantis on the tax and management of Disney World property, Disney can afford to not rub DeSantis face in his loss.
