“Six conservative states – Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and South Carolina – told the Supreme Court that Biden overstepped his legal authority with the program and violated the constitutional principle of separation of powers by embarking on a loan forgiveness program estimated to affect 40 million Americans.”.
This is the problem with conservative Republicans yelling about separation of powers and states rights.
The hypocrisy of conservatives is astounding.
Then there’s what happened after conservative justices overturned Roe v Wade.
The anti-abortion movement spent decades citing states rights as an argument for overturning Roe.
But Republicans quickly revealed a new level of hypocrisy when states started passing abortion legislation their citizens wanted.
All of a sudden Republicans weren’t too keen on states rights.
Senate Republicans quickly started talking about a federal ban on abortion.
One example in the not too distant past is when states started legalizing marijuana.
You had conservatives yelling that states should have to comply with the federal prohibition.
The reason conservatives didn’t say states should be free from federal interference is because they didn’t agree with legalizing marijuana.
You see, Republicans are all about states rights, until they don’t get their way, and then all bets are off.
And God forbid Biden give millions of Americans student loan relief after Republicans handed out massive tax cuts to corporations and the wealthy.
