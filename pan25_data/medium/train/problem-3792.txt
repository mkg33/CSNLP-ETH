Just giving fresh needles doesn't negate the fact that people are still going somewhere else to use street drugs.
With safe injection sites and government facilities that have the product, there are no deaths whatsoever.
There will always be drug addicts.
If we could have discreet government ran places, all the addicts can go to one place, use in a safe environment with nurses on hand, and there would be no overdoses or disease transmission and they would be off the street.
It would reduce crime and also allow functioning addicts a chance to be on a routine and allow them to keep a steady job.
It would also save the city or government so much money on incarcerations, ambulance rides, cleaning up homeless camps.
Its a win win for society as a whole and its all been documented.
A documentary I watched about it said that providing the substance in a safe location costs 1/3 of the price of jailing addicts and trying to clean up the streets.
And all of this is of course offset by having counselors on site to try and help people get clean.
If people weren't afraid of going to jail they'd be more likely to get help.
That headline misses the “new” part of the news.
Vancouver not charging people for possessing personal amounts of drugs is already how it’s worked for a long time so there’s no change there.
The new thing that starts tomorrow is that the Federal government has now decriminalized this for the entire Province of British Columbia.
So it’s every police force in BC other than Vancouver that’s embarking on something new.
