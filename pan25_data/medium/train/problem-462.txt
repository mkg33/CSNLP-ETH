Different countries (un)developed differently in WW2, depending on the year.
US and UK grew quite a lot during the war, but GDP started to falter towards the end (keep in mind a lot of that was military and foodstuff aid, and in the US that led to shortages in the stores and budget deficits reaching as high as about 27% in yearly terms, as we don't have quarterly data available), despite the highest growth rates in the history of the country, and were somewhat depressed in the first years after it.
Germany also made out relatively good before 1945, thanks to the looting from the countries it occupied, slave labor and military spending in general, before it fell by 29% in 1945 and nearly 53% in 1946.
I can't find data for Romania, Hungary, Poland, China etc.
Most data comes from at best 1950 so that probably says something for how bad things got.
1) WW2 bombers were notoriously inaccurate, it required hundreds of bombers to take out one factory.
2) Factories of the time period were relatively simple, and could be rebuilt or just moved somewhere else.
