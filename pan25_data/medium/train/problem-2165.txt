>About 30% of girls in Sierra Leone are married before the age of 18, according to government statistics.
In 2020, a ban on pregnant young women attending school was overturned, though social stigma often remains a barrier.
I'm studying global health right now.
Sierra Leone is likely to experience sustained development across the board at this point with rapidly improving objective data.
It's wild.
so, the future is not "Equal".
the future is not "everyone.
Nope!
the future, according to feminists, is "female".
Blateant Sexism.
Basically there is pretty much an exact correlation between women's rights and overall development.
There's loads of proposed casual factors.
Examples include increased productive lifespans, decreased disability, increased productivity in the workforce, more investment in children, etc.
We need more then fingers crossed unfortunately-We don’t even have rights to have abortions-you can go to jail if you have an abortion in the wrong state- we are forced to have babies- we are forced to have to go back to work then we can’t care for our children so we rely heavily on child care which that industry fell hard during the beginning of the pandemic- we are forced to send our kids to schools that they aren’t safe in- we have a huge problem with school to prison pipeline especially for nonwhite kids- the USA does not give a damn about our children- they just want their work force working.
Wish we could learn from so many other countries that are doing so much better then us when it comes to basic human rights.
Edit - Ahh, the feminists are out in force, downvoting anythign that calls for equality, and points out how sexist feminism is.
Typical.
Oh, and to everyone downvoting, tell me this... Would you be happy with a 30% quota for men too?
Or men only clubs and spaces?
If not, why not?
