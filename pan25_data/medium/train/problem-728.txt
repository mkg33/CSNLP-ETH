I agree mostly, but I hate when people act like Democrats are running hard on gay/trans rights and making it the cornerstone of their campaigns when they're absolutely not, and the times it does come up in their campaigns, it's in response to Republicans actively trying to kill us.
But then the blame gets put on Democrats for "focusing on social issues" when in reality it's the GOP that are heavily focusing on social issues and taking violent steps against us.
Then when a Democrat is like "hey maybe trans people deserve equal rights" everyone freaks the hell out about Democrat "identity politics.
".
In general, be courteous to others.
