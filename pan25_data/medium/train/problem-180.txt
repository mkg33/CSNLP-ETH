That kind of estimated figures are awfully damning against China.
Since China stopped issuing visa to both Japan and South Korea it might be good time for both countries to reconsider and try to wean itself away as much as they can on trade with China.
China being a bully again.
They reserve the right to ban travel to the mainland by foreign nationals but retaliate against anyone putting restrictions on them.
Restrict them.
Look I'm not going to argue with someone with no knowledge on the matter.
You can read the sources I linked on why this is stupid according to anyone who knows anything about covid.
Not sure where you live buddy but on this side of the world everyone is getting sick and not testing so infection rates and information is kind of unknown all over.
Other countries are not experiencing this level of infection rates and information suppression.
It’s up to the CCP to provide this, yet, they’re silent like the last surge that created a pandemic.
Are you saying mutations and new variants aren’t a risk then in a highly infectious and densely populated places like China?
Don’t mind the fact that their population doesn’t even trust their own vaccine, and that they didn’t even bring in mRNA vaccines up until recently.
Did China act “scientifically” during the first round of infections?
This is the result of information being hidden and them fucking their data.
No one in the west trusts them.
China made it political in 2019.
This is the result.
I'm saying it's political, yes.
You were making the argument that it's truly an effective measure to prevent new variants from landing on your shores.
