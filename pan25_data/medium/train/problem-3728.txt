No, as I understand it this is a system to a work permit, at which point you just get a green card and you can renew it as normal so long as youâ€™re employed.
The renewal of this plan would just increase the time for people to apply for the permit.
I mean the alternative to work-based green cards (where having a degree isn't strictly a requirement but definitely helps) in the US is family sponsorship (mostly through marriage), which almost all countries also have.
It's not that different from the rest of the world.
