Either way even if the US gets involved directly, that might make it no longer proxy by textbook definition, but it would still be the US effectively relying on TW to do the bulk of the fighting against the US's greatest adversary, or the US using another nation to attack it's enemies (and I don't want to make it sound overly manipulative, because obviously both Ukraine and Taiwan desperately want the aid of the west, and the west wants to aid them, but there is truth to the US wanting to use other nations to do the fighting if at all possible while instead supporting them financially...).
US is surrounding China with unsinkable bases whereas China have small artificial island base and one in Djibouti in Africa.
China is in process of obtaining permission to build second base in Equatorial Guiana .
The US military is actually researching ways to go green.
Both because they see the writing on the wall and want to still be operating when oil runs out, and transporting fuel all over the world in very vulnerable tankers is one of their biggest logistical problems.
