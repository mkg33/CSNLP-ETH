You (your government) did make sure to get the goods in just before getting in on any sanctions, and are still blocking the resale of ammunitions towards Ukraine.
Sorry to say Switzerland has no moral standing whatsoever but seems to just be trying to not piss anybody off without hurting business too much.
I am Singaporean, not Swiss.
To be honest, I think you are underestimating the exceptional break from neutrality a lot of countries have made for Ukraine.
You cannot expect quick response from countries who have decades of international agreements, internal laws, policies, and social conventions reinforcing that neutrality.
Let me put this in perspective: Ukraine is not a military ally, we do not have military agreements to protect it, so we don't have existing laws allowing us to implement emergency measures to break all the aforementioned agreements/laws/policies.
It's a lot easier to do all this when your country has interventionist policies like the EU or US, but that sort of stance is only viable when you're an economic superpower.
Keep in mind that it would be extremely easy, highly profitable even, for us to say "not our business", and stay neutral.
But we broke our own code, our own traditions, to do the right thing by sanctioning Russia.
That Switzerland is not breaking their own laws blocking them from providing military aid is not some conspiracy to help Russia.
It's democracy.
