Israel's always had the ability to end the conflict.
Hell with Gaza they wouldn't even have to do anything, they provide the region with all its water and power, all they would have to do is stop it.
The conflict continues because the Israelis have been holding out hope that one day the Palestinians will choose peace, but that has been an ever diminishing hope as seen by the rightward shift in the country.
A third intifada would accelerate that exponentially.
The reason the conflict continues is only because the international community would be appalled with Israel if they did what they actually want.
It's all a waiting game until they can engineer a situation that allows them to get away with it on the international stage... Hopefully this isn't the start of that.
Constant attacks against Jewish refugees and immigrants between 1920 and 1936 is why they didn't get their 'one state solution'.
They rejected the two state solution and attempted to genocide the Jews in 1947 which resulted in them getting no state.
Israel gave Gaza independence, they elected Hamas who promised to wage war until all the Jews were dead and attacked continuously, so Israel built a wall and started the blockade.
Israel has been condemened more than every other nation on earth combined, its the only nation the UN has ever specifically condemned for the treatment of women - not nations where women can't vote, drive, get an abortion, have any health autonomy at all, forced marriages, child marriages, etc.
Israel.
