santos: My festival for furthering LGBTQ+ rights with all proceeds going to a "real" charity and not some fake shell / other person account, to be sure not named george santos.
Shit, Evangelicals voted for Trump.
Some even claimed not long ago that he was chosen by god.
I know Trump held up that bible but that was probably the only time in his entire life that he had ever touched one.
The only time something is objectionable for Republicans is when it isn't convenient for them or if a Lib did it.
Right now Santos is convenient for them because if there were to be another election in that district there's a good chance it would go against them.
So in the meantime it's more convenient that Santos maintains that seat and I don't think there's anything that would ever change that.
Hell, right now he even has committee assignments and those are relatively easy to take away and they haven't even done that.
