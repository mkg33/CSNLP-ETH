I’m excited to see our Gov spending their time banning videos of people’s cats & dogs doing funny things.
Maybe they could pay attention to the 10M registered voters that are waving their arms asking someone, anyone to investigate stock market manipulation.
Hedge Funds/Market makers control the market like a god damn video game, stealing millions of dollars from retail investors daily.
Maybe they could have some serious conversations about our energy policy.
All these fuckers do is bicker and then spend time banning an App that is utilized by unproductive people.
What secrets is China gonna steal?
The perfect ratio if Mentos to CokaCola?
WTF is wrong with our elected officials??
?
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
