This is a professional doing their job to prevent military escalation.
Europe is walking the middle ground between a loss of Ukraine to a corrupt mafia state and full European military engagement.
As Russia gets closer to capitulation, they could try to drag Europe down with them, making Stoltenberg's role all that more critical.
Russia will not use nuclear weapons unless they are faced with an existential threat.
They have full control on when hostilities cease and thus have no cause or basis for their use.
Indeed, their use would manifest the very existential threat they seek to avoid.
Very good point.
Russia's posturing, complaints, and actions seem to be done with the distorted view that they will prevent a scenario that is guaranteed if Russia uses nukes.
America used them with the excuse of saving more lives by ending the war earlier.
The reality was they wanted the rest of the world to know not to ever fuck with them again.
The reason for this is that there has to be a response to any nation using nuclear weapons, or else others will use them in future conflicts.
And since any response from NATO attacking Russia could include them launching the nukes, it is possible that the US might try a decapitation strike to prevent that.
The threat of mutually assured destruction has prevented nuclear exchange so far, so hopefully the threat is still enough this time.
But with Putin facing death if he doesn't use them, he could gamble that NATO won't risk missiles flying.
A full NATO response could be anything from a full economic embargo to direct military action.
Russia has already shown that its air defenses are all but useless with the drone attacks on their airbase recently.
Direct military action could include a full nuclear strike on Russia as well, though unlikely.
This is assuming that Putin, a dictator that has been in power for decades, hasn't replaced the key people in the chain of command with loyal sycophants.
Sycophants whose lives would also be at risk if Putin falls.
