Thing is, even if it was some non-zero number, the Americans are still flying planeloads of rocket pods in.
Even the 20 that Ukraine has is stretching logistics chains along that route to their limits.... any losses would be easily replenished, and a few momentary losses wouldn't have a particularly noteworthy impact on the amount of heat they're sending downrange.
At this point Putin's probably focusing on the Blazing Saddles version: "No noose is good noose."
(or was that Men in Tights?
They both had that hangman character in them).
Both sides are playing the propaganda game.
I doubt Ukraine would want to confirm a kill for the Russians.
I wouldn't be surprised if a few had been hit given how high priority they must be as targets.
People frequently say this in these threads, but it's about as accurate as "both-sidesing" U.S. political parties.
If you look at Ukraine's reported numbers on various things in the war, they come a hell of a lot closer to numbers confirmed by other sources than the Russian's numbers do.
I'm looking forward to seeing a number of NATO folks go on a special logistics vacation into Ukraine.
Get those HIMARS shooting more often.
