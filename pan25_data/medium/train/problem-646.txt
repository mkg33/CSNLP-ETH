Not really anymore.
He knows people in west see through his bs, they’ve accepted the fact that it’s time for him to go, even Germany, which he always considered to have a potential of being russias main ally in Europe, and splitting the spheres of influence with them when US is “gone”, is one step away from kicking his laying body.
He only needs to keep his image going amongst the domestic audience, and the domestic audience won’t get news of Zelensky calling putin out.
Putin wants the narrative of UA being “sub-humans” and “not real country” going, and their opinions or wishes are not worthy of reactions.
He’s like a con artist, but on a bigger scale - involving war and hundreds of thousands people dying.
Putin has some medical issue that prevents him from doing all the propaganda videos that he has been famous for over 20 years, at a time that they are needed the most.
Seems very likely to me he does have a severe health issue (or perhaps just old age frailty) and because showing weakness invites being overthrown, he has greatly reduced his public appearances.
