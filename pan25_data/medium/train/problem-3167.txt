also russia: destroys Mariupol (a mostly russian speaking city in the Donbas with a large ethnic russian minority) killing tens of thousands Ukrainian citizens(minimum.
possibly even more then 100,000.
).
That's exactly what they've been doing for centuries.
Tons of russians living in Crimea and they've brought thousands of settlers to Donbas and Luhansk.
Lots of empty apartments were left there when Ukrainians ran away in 2014.
Those are all troops from minority heavy regions of Russia.
For example they sent in all their eastern and Chechnyan troops and conscripted heavily there to thin out the minorities first.
Yep, not an uncommon occurrence in dictatorships.
80 years ago, a decent proportion of the 3rd Reichâ€™s troops fighting the Allies in France post D-Day were Czech, not German.
russia: claims that Ukraine bombing russian speakers in the Donbas for eight years, this is the worst attrocity ever.
(The combined total civilian casualties for previous phase of the war was around 3000 largely in the first 2 years and many of those deaths were caused by Russia and their proxies.
military deaths were somewhat more common though).
