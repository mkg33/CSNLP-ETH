People overestimate "the petrodollar" crap.
The dollar is valuable because majority of what people consume and use these days are American exports/inventions.
From software and hardware's you're using to the food you eat.
The dollar is valuable because the rest of the world needs to buy American products.
It's not just because oil is traded in dollars.
In fact, the main reason oil was initially traded in dollars was because of the value of American products - states like Saudi Arabia need dollars (for buying military arms to well technology in general, to hiring foreign workers from 1st world country to speed up industrialization).
Trading it in local currency would yield more losses for the oil regimes, as it would make oil super cheap for 1st world countries.
I mean, people can just boycott watching grown men kick a ball around instead of acting all shocked pikachu when corrupt and profit seeking organisations act corrupt and seek profits.
And it's not as if you can't watch grown men kick a ball around plenty of other times throughout the year...
