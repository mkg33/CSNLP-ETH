These now have become family-priority parking space, with the same vague definition and practicality as before, by the same mayor who implemented it prior.
Just fyi, it didn't really have any legal binding in the first place and was more of a recommendation/guideline.
I still donâ€™t get how it makes things safer.
A few spots instead of where traditionally disabled or family spots are is going to make a difference?
Use more cameras, security guards etc a few car park spots is not going to make any kind of impact.
Those spots are typically there to make it easier for family or disabled and by extension safer with a shorter trip.
Useless a few token spots for one gender just so you ca say your doing something.
So in a practical sense it was a token effort so again tell me how it makes an impact on the larger problem?
Sure, they are a bit over the line, but not a whole lot.
The free spot is still usable at least.
So I wouldn't say they parked wrongly, but rather... rightn't.
I wasn't.
But at the same time, they might've been forced to park like that because there were no free spaces and some idiot parked her car like an idiot across 2 spots.
I've lived for some time in Seoul and it's not a rare occurrence.
It's easy to jump on and judge people without context, but real world is a bit more nuanced than that.
