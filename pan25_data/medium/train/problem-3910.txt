Thinking about what money is for a moment: it's labor hours, converted into a standardized form of legal tender.
If you possess more standardized labor hours in value than the amount of labor it is physically possible for you to do, you have exploited someone along the way towards acquiring that sum.
That is frankly also to be expected and is allowed within reason, but when you have more labor hours banked than you could ever hope to actually work by several orders of magnitude....
Probably means there's a sweatshop or something similar out there underlying your profits.
For someone to have $50 million banked, that means a bunch of other people somewhere else were paid pennies for their labor that should have paid out a full dollar (or equivalent in local currency).
Human beings aren't human beings unless they have the same amount of possessions as other human beings?
I'm not a capitalism fellatiator but that seems like a silly blanket rule.
Denying others compassion is what creates the exact kind of tyranny you & I hate.
