Well yeah, Hispanic voters have been saying they have felt the term was pushed on them by liberal elites (which is true) so the right thing to do is for Democrats (specifically liberal arts academics) to take a step back from trying to unilaterally change language.
It's an encroachment on their identity.
Let people identify however they want, but don't force people to adapt when the distinction is as small as Latinx vs Latino/a.
I've been in psychology academia for way too long and even people in my circles who previously supported things like this have been rolling their eyes at some of these little language nuances that a very small amount of people actually care about and nobody is saying they can't use themselves.
I love liberal arts and the social sciences but sometimes they believe they have far more social capital than they actually have.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
