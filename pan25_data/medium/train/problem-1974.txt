The first A bomb to be used on Hiroshima was 80% but was rather large at 64kilograms of uranium and weighed 9700 lbs.
They probably are already there.
The enrichment work you have to do to reach weapons grade is about twice the amount you need to do to reach reactor grade.
You start with natural uranium.
Of 1000 atoms 7 are the U-235 you want.
You remove 825 atoms of U-238 to reach enrichment of 4%.
By removing the remaining 168 atoms of U-238 you are left with 7 atoms of U-235.
Although, the higher the grade of the feedstock material the less efficient the process becomes.
But you only need to reach 95% enrichment, you don't need to remove the very last bit of U-238, so you can stop there.
Like I said the amount of work is about double.
If Iran wants to acquire weapons grade stuff they only have to run their uranium hexaflouride feedstock through their centrifuges twice instead of only one time.
Edit: My point is that Iran has the capability to enrich to high-grade for years now.
The "closer than ever" talking point is kinda tautological and redundant.
Yes, they had set-backs due to sabotage and assassinations of key persons, but if Iran really, really wanted to build nukes they would have done so years ago.
The very reason the NPT worked so long at all was that many countries recognized that such an arms race will only destabilize their regions and threaten them more and not bring safety.
North Korea is also inflicting so much harm to their own people which the question how it is a good thing that the leader clan now gained nuclear immunity to continue their atrocities that destroys a nation.
I thought no one wants North Korea.
You’d have to sink an ungodly amount of time and resources to get it functioning.
You’d probably need specialist cult deprogrammers on a scale that isn’t even possible just to start.
