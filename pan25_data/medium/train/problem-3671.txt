No, I didn't miss the affiliation, however I didn't know if that meant that the program was accredited.
I did do a Google search, and found the website, and spent more than two seconds on it, but I was on mobile and it was difficult to navigate.
So, I ask a question on an internet chat forum, and added background to my line of inquiry.
But I know, it's the internet, and if I even ask a question against a 'good guy' then I must be an antagonist trying to mislead the public.
I'll stick to regurgitating simple insults at the 'bad guys' so I can be part of the pack.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
