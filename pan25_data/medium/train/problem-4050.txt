TLDR: some dick head went and started his own private army and filled it with the worst kinds of people you can think of.
Rapists, murderers, people who turn without signalling.
A lot of people see it as pretentious.
I got used to doing it in the Air Force and almost primarily do so.
It’s nicknamed “combat parking”, makes it easier to exfiltrate an area for sure.
I mean I'm pretty sure I have a wider field of view looking out through the windshield and windows than looking through a backup camera or using the mirrors as well as having less blind spots.
Like if someone was walking along the cars in the spaces next to mine I feel like I'd definitely see them earlier as I'm pulling out if I had previously backed in because I would be able to lean forwards and peak around the cars to my left and right.
However, there are cases where it makes more sense to pull in such as if a parking lot has angled parking spots or if theres an open spot behind the one you're pulling into so that you can just pull into that other spot and be setup to just pull out later.
I've always lived in a state without front plates and I've never seen backing up described as a negative, even by cops or rent-a-cops.
In fact I remember the DMV telling us that backing up is preferable for exactly the reason you specified: people going in reverse tend to hit other cars or people a lot, even if just at low speed.
If OP wanted to joke around he should've stated something like... parallel parking; everyone knows that's a lot easier to fuck up.
Or... people who back into parking spaces and have to try 5 times and still don't get it right.
I just don't get why its pretentious to some people.
It just makes more sense to me to be able to have a wider view when pulling out of a parking spot after backing in.
Like how can trying to be safe be seen as pretentious?
Weirdos.
