Hey Trump supporters.
Trump said before the 2016 election, that he would show his tax returns after the audit was completed.
The audit is 6 years and counting, and he has never shown his tax returns.
The fact that Trump hasn't shown them for 6 years is just more evidence of him "owning the libs" for his supporters.
They will never see it as a lie he told them.
