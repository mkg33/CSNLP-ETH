That’s crude steel but The Russians are undercutting local more advanced steels and seems India is buying all that Russia can supply and then exporting it ….
They are doing alot India is getting rich off it, not just from the cheap oil but rolled steel as well, at least Russia is not getting their full international market value.
This is the prime reason why China cares.
It's not love for a fellow autocrat, it's not love for Russia, it's not because they hate NATO, but it's because their regional rival is getting a really cheap deal on Russian goods.
This is why India isn't speaking out against the war in Ukraine.
They don't hate the Ukrainians or love the Russians per se, but it's pure pragmatism.
Cheap goods.
China fucking hates the idea of cheap materials finding its way to India.
Also Russian military equipment finds its way into India, something China also doesn't like.
China can now swoop in, try to be the ally the Russians want and then pluck every square centimetre of Russian soil for every bit of raw materials they can find as a thank you for saving Russia.
