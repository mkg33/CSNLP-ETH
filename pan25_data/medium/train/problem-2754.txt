It’s insane to me that Congress can block a strike.
If it was WW2 and a rail strike means that people die and we lose the war then I’d understand, but all that’s threatened is the economy.
The strike would have negative repercussions for pretty much everyone, but if the services the workers provide is this important than they should be compensated accordingly and they’re asking for the bare minimum.
It seems like if you lose the ability to strike you should be so well compensated and have so many benefits there’s virtually no reason to strike.

Fun note, in my search for examples on that one, apparently of third amendment violations, but they’re pretty laughable at best.
