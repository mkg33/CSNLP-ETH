This is waaaay besides the point, but why does the article go out of it's way to mention 'including 4 women'?
Women are belong to the subcategory of people, yes.
I was just about to say the same thing.
I hate it when headlines say "X number of people dead, including X number of women/kids".
Are adult men's lives inherently worth less?
It's cause usually these crimes are perpetrated by men, and the targets are more than likely rival men.
Not always, but usually.
Women are most often just innocent bystanders/targets of association.
I'd say in recent history women and children tend to be the targets most of the time.
Whether in war or mass shootings or serial killers or what have you... usually it's women and children dying at the hands of a man/ men.
But here we have almost 50/50 split of adults, but the headline has to point out 4 of them are especially tragic.
Women and children have always been worth less than men.
At least, in their eyes & according to history.
Throw race or low status in there and they're really really fucked.
If I tried to list all the ways women have been held back and undervalued by men here we'd both get bored af and just leave.
Be realistic, not too long ago a woman couldn't have her own bank account.
She couldn't buy a house.
(I mean, can't now either but that's for different reasons.)
She wasn't allowed to vote.
Nevermind all the other crap...
Yes.
"victimless crime", my ass.
Anyone who says doing drugs is a victimless crime ignores the obvious violence that goes with the drug trade, and ignores how doing drugs impacts the user's family and friends.
I'm saying this as someone whose brother did drugs for 14 years, tormented our family to no end, and died of an overdose at the age of 34.
