In the event that the current Russian government falls and sees some sort of return to democracy, freedom, and respect for neighbors, there will be a desire among some in the west to embrace this, to trust Russia, to expand trade with them and be friendly.
But this already happened before and then Russia went back to the bad old days.
And it can happen again.
If Russia sees a change in leadership and a turn inward, the west mustn't get overly trusting - instead it should keep decoupling from the Russian economy, expanding NATO up to Russian borders as much as possible, and investing not in rebuilding Russia but in boosting the neighbors bordering Russia.
If Russia still tolerates it, then a slow cautious thaw in relations can occur, and if Russia seethes with rage and quickly goes back to the bad old days again in response, well, the west will be more ready and more of Russia's neighbors will be defended by the NATO nuclear MADman umbrella.
Another problem is that although whilst a minority, there are still a significant number of western leaders who would like to emulate the Russian Oligarchy at the expense of their populace.
Trump and Johnson spring to mind at working hard to diminish their own peoples human rights and access to basic resources like healthcare.
"Wait, you're not going to let us subjugate and pillage eastern Europe to our hearts desire?"
