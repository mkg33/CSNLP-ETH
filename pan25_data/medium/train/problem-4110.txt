Sinema is following the example of her political idol Joe Lieberman, except Joe waited until after he LOST the primary to make his switch to "independent" (which he later changed to his own one man party... "Connecticut for Lieberman" or whatever it was called).
Or, to look at this in a positive light, sheâ€™s splitting the GOP vote.
GOP Moderates and never-Trumpers may vote for her and not whatever Kari Lake MAGA moron the GOP primary voters want.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
This whole scam is her attempt at self-preservation.
By labeling herself as "independent", she cannot be primaried.
If the AZ Democrats choose to run another candidate against her, they risk splitting the vote and tossing the Senate seat to the Republican... who will most likely be Kari Lake or some other MAGAtt wackjob.
