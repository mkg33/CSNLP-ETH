The Korean War was the 5th deadliest conflict in US history, with \35k US troops dead and another \90k wounded over 4 years.
It couldn't justify that level of direct military intervention indefinitely, and without their help North Korea would have taken over the entire country.
The US hasn't had to risk any troops at all in Ukraine, only equipment and money, so it has far less incentive to withdraw support.
Some corrupt far right politicians want to do Russia's bidding, but it's not that popular of a position even in their own party.
Furthermore, Ukraine was pretty well prepared for this, while Russia has been in shambles, so while the US withdrawing support would be painful, it's far from clear that it would tilt the balance enough to force Ukraine to stop fighting.
