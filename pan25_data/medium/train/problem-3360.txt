Why aren't there laws in place to stop this shit, there's no reason that anyone above 70 should be deciding how the average American lives.
Their views have been outdated for decades and don't represent the current state of the world.
It's mindblowing..
I can’t wait for a post-McConnell America.
Luckily he has left than a decade left.
Even if he lives past 90 there will be no way a person that old would have the mental capacity to be of any use in the senate.
He’s one of the last few competent Republicans too.
And by competent I mean efficient at getting what he wants not getting things done that benefit Americans.
