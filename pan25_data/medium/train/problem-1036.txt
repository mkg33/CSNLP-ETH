Best case is DeSantis gets the nomination and loses to a Democrat because A) he has no personal appeal and B) Trump splits the Republican vote with a third party spoiler run OR just griefs DeSantis from the sidelines and depresses Republican turnout.
If the Republican field is crowded, then Trump has a good shot at getting the nomination.
In a group of Pompeos and Hayleys and Pences AND DeSantisis he has a better shot at carving out enough primary votes.
If it's a narrow field, like Trump v. DeSantis, then the outcome is a lot less clear.
I think you get a lot of people seeing Ron as Trump without the crazy.
It's not like Trump is any more insane or demented than last time, though perhaps he's over enbroidered his nonsense a bit more, it just that most Republicans, like everyone else, has become dissatisfied and bored with his circus act.
I can't be expected to cleanup this level of fuckery every day - going to let nature take its course on this one.
