republicans every election cycle: "We would never vote to cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid It's inhumane, who would even consider that?
".
republicans every time they have a majority: "lol why did you believe us?
Of course we're going after Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
That's, like, our top priority.

Republican men wanting to see Hunter Biden's dick pics...they are willing to shut down the country just for a peek.
This sounds like extreme penis envy.
Lyndsey Graham is licking his lips and ready to drool all over Hunter's cock.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The Republicans Two Santa Claus Theory.
When Republicans are in charge, spend like drunken Santa... run up the debt... cut taxes to look appealing.
When Democrats are in charge, blame them for the deficit (your grandchildren will have to pay for this spending!)
and threaten to hold the debt ceiling hostage and force Democrats to cut their own Santa Claus programs.
It's a well documented plan... and it works for the GOP.
Every time.
