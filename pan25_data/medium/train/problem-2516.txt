Because of the market value in the UK, their are loads of investors what invest into properties in the UK, these investors simply want to earn more money so they increase their rent prices.
Not all investors specifically buy houses to rent them out but a lot do, if you put a cap on rent then these investors would likely pull out of the UK market what would see a massive drop in house prices across the UK what the government do not want to see has this will effect the economy.
The problem what is happening now these investors are seeing they can make money so they are increasing prices across the board and with housing prices dropping but nobody can afford to buy houses due to the financial crisis the rich will buy more houses and rent them out with high rent prices, working people already struggling are simply giving more money to greedy fat cunts because they have no other choice.
Totally agree, the entire system cannot work under so much demand constantly inflating prices artificially of initial cost.
We are at a point at which extreme regulation and very bold new thinking is the only way out of potentially driving a quarter of the population into extreme poverty, or even homelessness.
