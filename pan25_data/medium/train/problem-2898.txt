One such instance in his 2022 report is titled FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SPENDS $28 MILLION ON CAMOUFLAGE THAT YOU CAN SEE.
What he is referring to is the decision of the DOD to outfit Afghan troops.
This is based on the decision by the DOD to buy proprietary camo patterns (i.e.
uniform patterns owned by a private company) rather than using camo patterns already owned by the DOD, which would have cost the DOD nothing to use.
The Afghan minister of defense chose the pattern, which was a forest pattern that may not have been appropriate for the Afghan environment.
Again, this was to outfit his own forces.
This certainly seems to have been a mistake and it certainly seems to have been spending that we could have avoided.
However, this decision was made in 2008, and (again), this spending (to my knowledge) last occurred in 2017.
So, Paul is 14 years too late in his complaint about this decision and 6 years too late in his complaint about the spending itself.
Further, in his report he does not mention the years in which this spending occurred.
Doing this is, IMO, purposeful and makes it appear as though the spending happened all in 2022, which is when his report was issued.
