Risky idealism like this is the only way for good people to win.
Ukraine itself could propably use those 60 ships worth of grain to feed their own, especially since they wont be able to grow anything until the war ends.
But sending it off to african nations during these conditions, like its part of some peacetime WHO effort?
Thats really quite crazy.
The ukrainians are aware of africas dependence on their exports and despite the devestating war at home they still work to avoid a famine in another part of the world.
Zelensky truly is a great leader.
To the contrary!
Ukraine should be giving their gain to everyone - perhaps in particular to those pro Putin countries: what better way to show what they're missing by being pro Putin countries?
Sending the food is however still a nice thing to do, because they surely need the money for weapons.
To be fair, they have large areas where they can, and do, grow crops.
At most 1/3of the country is hit by actual troop movement.
Probably much less is exposed to fighting that affects farming notably.
