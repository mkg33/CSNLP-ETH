Common thing in Iran.
Irans brightest students go to university to leave their country.
This is why most Iranians abroad in the west you meet are likely educated well, with masters degrees at least.
My GF’s roommates boyfriend (mouthful I know) he transferred to our school as soon as he finished his undergrad in Tehran and completed his masters and PHD back to back.
When the protests where just starting I would notice him on the phone more and more everyday with his family, he clearly feels awful abt what’s happening but he’s now in Arizona working a pretty good job.
It’s kinda sad that these bright minds have to leave their home to pursue their goals but at the same time they ARE pursuing their goals and actually succeeding with even more obstacles.
You actually find them at very high rates in smaller masters and PhD programs which usually have minor funding and will take most people with a decent education because not many people apply vs the amount of industrial funding they have.
It might not be very exciting research, but it’ll get you a visa and a modest stipend or at least free education.
You’ll just have to live cheaply and live in mostly rural areas.
