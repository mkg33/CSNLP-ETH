Though to be fair it originally started being reported in 16th Century Europe that raping a virgin could cure STDâ€™s.
Worst part it still happens every now and again world wide.
It has a large part due to the old Christian belief that a virgin blood can ward off demons.
It remains painfully common in South Africa.
I think a lot of westerners see this stuff and are flabbergasted by traditional beliefs in different cultures, and regard them as superstition.
But large proportions of westerners (especially in the US) will go to church on Sunday, actually believe that there is a supernatural being that is responsible for their fortune and misfortune, and that there is an actual heaven where certain people ascended and where people will go in an afterlife.
And will hold the view above about other beliefs being ridiculous, with no irony whatsoever.
Now if you all will forgive me I have a mix of alcohol and now legal weed to help me forget this again.
is this a SA thing?
I mean, the one SA guy I know is a raging MAGA douche canoe that believes in flat earth, jewish space lasers, and Qanon.
I just figured it was from the last 25 years in the US.
I mean, are you just going to ignore the whole swarm of problems that church can bring about?
At least if you talk to bees you are only risking your own health.
Christians have this real nasty habit of making their religious hangups everyone else's problem.
