...except it is closer to "Build this thing that costs $5k.
I know it costs $5k from the outset.
However if I don't get the raise I was expecting, I may say I can only pay 3k later because I don't want to run up my credit card to pay you according to our legally binding contract.
We both know I'll eventually pay the $5k, but I might drag the discusson so long / miss the mail delivery cutoff on the final day that your work van gets repossed since you didn't have the cash to make the payment, and you'll ruin my credit such that I really \_won't\_ be able to charge the balance to my credit card (or anything else for that matter) and I'll go bankrupt shortly therafter.
Hope that doesn't happen...'.
