I think we'll see a lot of Erdogan painting criticism of him as being in bad taste in the face of the tragedy.
And this is all coming on the backdrop of Turkey's upcoming election.
I hate how politicians do that… “we need unity now, no time for criticism” but then do the exact same thing when the shoe is on the other foot.
To an even more extreme degree with people with Erdogan’s political leanings.
It’s a massive natural disaster, of course there will be issues.
I despise Erdogan but this sort of tragedy would be tough for any country to deal with perfectly.
You’re missing the point entirely.
The issues he’s being criticised for aren’t because of the disaster.
It’s essentially like he’s been saying “we’re ready for a fire because of all the money we’ve invested in the fire department” and then there’s a huge multi-storey blaze and the only response is some guy with a fire extinguisher.
The criticism is about huge sums of money allegedly spent on disaster preparedness which had gone “missing”.
