I think this is correct.
If there is ever any issues with crime, let the police handle it discreetly.
You should ALWAYS be suspect of what is called in the US "yellow journalism" aka attempting to inflame fears about a vulnerable group.
I can say this though, and I've seen it with my own eyes - there are Russians pretending to be Ukrainians, and doing bad things.
And to say there aren't criminal Ukrainians - well one of the collaborators in Zaporizhia just blew himself up today (oopsie!).
They exist, but at at a far smaller percentage than any hack journalist paid off by Ruzzia would want you to believe.
The thing with refugees, is that they're just people.
People can suck, so some refugees also suck.
Plenty of people are great, so plenty of refugees are also great.
Aren't most Ukrainian refugees women, children and older men - since men of a certain age aren't allowed to leave the country except under specific circumstances?
Or is that law no longer in effect?
I would like to help out Ukrainian refugees, unfortunately here in Germany they're somehow much less visible than the refugees in 2015 were.
And they by and large prefer to live in large cities where they can find Ukrainian expats already living there.
Despite efforts to the contrary, I've heard Ukrainians complain on TV that their registration process was complicated and it took weeks until they received their benefits, etc.
But that might also have to do with them flocking to big cities - like many seem to choose Berlin, but Berlin is as a federal state probably the most broke, worst organized of all federal states in Germany.
