It's a scheme to enter the EU illegally.
A group of people book a flight across or close to EU airspace.
Then one of them fakes a medical emergency to divert the plane to an airport in the EU and the rest try to get off the plane there.
Documents are being checked before boarding on the plane by airport+airline staff and border controls unless the flight is domestic/Schengen.
If any airport/airline skips that they compromise safety of large international hubs as minimum, could not airports/airlines be fined/barred from international air traffic if this is systematic?
It was scheduled to be a non-stop flight from Morocco to Turkey, so the airline only had to ensure that all passengers had travel documents to enter Turkey.
Presumably all passengers had obtained such documents (e.g.
tourist visas), including those who didn't actually plan to travel to Turkey.
Then require a Schengen visa/EEA residence permit or visa free passport to fly over or something.
What do you propose, allow to anyone to land and unload a potential threat in the middle of Spain, behind any border controls/defence?
It can be a private jet with drugs/weapons/extremists next time ya know.
Imagine a flight from Casablanca to Moscow.
You're basically doubling flight time and the costs associated with it while also limiting the planes that even have the fuel capacity to do it.
Your next proposal means people need to get some kind of visa for every country they pass over.
Surely I don't need to point out the logistical nightmare that creates?
This is all before mentioning that most flights between North Africa and Eastern Europe are via a Schengen airport in the first place.
You have to help with any emergencies on board be it a technical or a medical issue, this is out of the question.
My comment was referring to closing the loop for smugglers attempting to exploit air traffic and faking emergencies to penetrate border controls.
Air traffic exploitation can be quite dangerous.
