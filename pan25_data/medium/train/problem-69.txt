I will be honest I didn’t have high hopes after Mueller investigation and how it just fell flat (in part of Trump’s team burying it).
I think the Jan 6 Committee did an amazing job of presenting the data in a clear concise way but also made it interesting.
The videos of the insurrection thrown in with the interviews helped to drive the point home.
This was not exactly an easy web to untangle and I think they brought to light more than most expected.
I will be honest hearing from the people who planned and executed trying to over throw the government made it more terrifying.
We all knew the general plan and people involved but how close they came to succeeding scares me for the next Trump with an ounce of self control who could succeed.
We need to vote like our lives depend on if we want to keep these people out of office.
In general, be courteous to others.
