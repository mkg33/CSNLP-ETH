I mentioned in a different post that, yes it's possible he could have lied about donating dark money....but it wouldn't really make any sense, for this exact reason here.
Pretty much anything SBF says should be viewed through the lens of someone trying to save face and avoid jail.
There's a lot of speculation on whether or not he was lying about donating to the Republicans, which can't really be validated unless someone gets to the bottom of dark money in politics.
He either did donate to both sides, or he didn't & is now facing a campaign finance complaint for something he didn't actually do (on top of everything else).
Twas fun listening to him whining about how Coffee was "monopolizing" the Q&A when he got maybe 30 or so minutes, and that was only due to him using obviously bs excuses.
Coffee has a short video of it on his YouTube.
He just went over the highlights but it was funny listening to his lies and BS as to why he's just the most inept owner of a crypto exchange.
Well, it is hard to take the word of a fraudster at face value.
After all, this is the same guy trying to go around and claiming that he literally had no idea what was going on under his nose.
He flipped out on Coffeezilla the other day in an open Q&A.
