Funnily enough, there is an already existing entity called the that had the original final goal of fusing Russia and Belarus together in a federation.
It's also probable that Lukashenko, seeking economic relief rather than fusion there in the first place, contrary to Yeltsin, had in mind to pull a great switcheroo after Yeltsin step down, to actually embrace fusion and being the president of the whole new federation.
Of course it failed in an epic fashion and Agroführer is now reduced to offer a tractor to Putin for his birthday.
Maybe, but it's never his failure, take trump's famous "I take responsibility for nothing" comment, they live in this charmed life where they are the main characters and everyone else is NPCs.
The NPCs can't win because everything good comes from them, and the narcissist can't lose because failure only exists for NPCs.
Wouldn't put it past Russia to drop a ton of missiles on his head since the UA army likely hasn't gotten anti-air systems fully in position along the west Dnieper bank yet.
russia isn’t in the G7 or G20 anymore; they’re closer to North Korea now than a developed economy after starting a war for lebensraum.
As long as the Kremlin holds power russia will never attend either meeting ever again, and sanctions will never be lifted.
