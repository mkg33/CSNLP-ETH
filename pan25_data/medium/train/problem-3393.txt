Extremists usually call for cease fire when they lose men and equipment.
Once they have reorganized their forces they break cease fire and continue this cycle until they are all either killed or they have won.
Not just extremists, every single forces that has ever walked across done that.
Also read the article next time ?
They ended ceasefire because their commanders started getting killed.
Yes, it's not actually the TTP that broke the ceasefire, it's Pakistan that's about to launch operations on the TTP in afghan soil.
The Pakistani military recently went through a soft military coup overthrowing both its own prime minister and the head of the ISI, who rejected pakistan army proposals of attacking the TTP within afghanistan.
Now that most of the pakistani civilian government is on the army's side, the army is fulfilling its original objective it's been waiting for since August 2021.
I am damn sure Talibanis aren't going to forget anything,not today not even tomorrow but someday they gonna hit US were they hurt the most and US deserves it.
That is the same corrupted family that US wants in power lol.
Why ?
Because the non-corrupted guy allies with China.
US doesn't give a flying fuck about Taliban anymore.
The Taliban chapter is closed for them.
