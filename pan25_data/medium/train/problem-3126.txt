I work in a restaurant with a 75% discount on meals for servers, and all others eat free.
50% off alcohol, too, can pull a beer and a shot for less than $5.
That free meal used to be ubiquitous, along with a staff discount on anything else purchased, but then that became rare.
Then it became just staff discount, and no discount on alcohol or pricier stuff like steaks.
These days it's staff discount only on food purchased during working hours and only for yourself.
Still no steaks, lobster or alcohol.
Where I work, I can eat whenever I want and my boss only take 8$/week on my paycheck for that.
Obviously, I don't eat the biggest plate on the menu, but sometimes, I treat myself anyway.
It really helps at the end of the month and i'm grateful for that.
The restaurant I worked at in college let us take home a large pizza every shift.
You could put as many toppings on it as you wanted.
The boss was a bit of an a-hole, but a complete legend for how many hungry students he employed.
Love ya Alvaro.
