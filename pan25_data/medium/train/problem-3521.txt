Russia has suffered a massive brain drain.
A million people that could (engineers, rich people, doctors, scientists... etc) have left.
They cannot afford to lose the few bright bulbs they have left.
Wait, he tried to shoot nuclear bombs and we are alive because they failed?
This doesn't sound right.
Wouldn't NATO react to the trigger, even if Russia failed to launch the weapon?
Russia/Soviet Union fell away from Stalinism in the early 50’s whereas North Korea stuck with it.
It’s kind of like a Catholic and a Greek Orthodox dating, on the surface they’re really similar but after a few months they end up in an argument about the fallibility of the pope and the whole thing falls apart.
What I’m getting at is Russia and North Korea are ideologically similar, but still different enough they’ll fight if nobody else is in the room.
It’s like a guy and his college roommate, they end up hating each other half the time but you still have each other’s back in a fight.
The only similarity I can see is that it's a kleptocracy, their leaders think they infallible, and everyone surrounding them is terrified of them.
Stalinism collectivism focused on the benefits to the nation rather than the leader.
The USSR was very perceived to be "successful" under Stalin, partly because they hid all the killings and famine.
Khrushchev denounced Stalin after Stalin died.
Kim Il Sung liked Stalinism because it was more isolationist and dictatorial than the communism in Soviet Union.
The Soviet Union at least pretended they were for the workers, DPRK just considered that a waste of time.
