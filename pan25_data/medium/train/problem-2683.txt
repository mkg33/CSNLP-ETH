The bad blood goes back much farther than WW2.
Hideyoshi Toyotomi (Japanese shogun) tried invading Korea twice during his rule(late 1500s).
According to what I've read, the Japanese might've actually been worse the first time around.
Cutting off noses and ears as trophies/record the number of dead enemies was apparently an order from the top, as well as the rape, murder, looting, and other horrors that seem to be recorded when the Japanese decide to go imperialistic.
The nose and ears were actually collected and enshrined, in a shrine called mimizuka, in Kyoto.
I didn’t visit, but from what I’ve heard, that shrine is not really highlighted or talked about in Tourist Brochures.
Japan came out looking pretty good, there was a huge cultural renaissance in Japan, thanks to all the artisans and craftsmen they kidnapped.
And pretty much none of the daimyos or soldiers that fought ever faced any penalties.
The Japanese invasion is also what led to a slowly decaying state of Joseon, 1/3 of the population is believed to have died or starved following the war.
In addition, Joseon took on an even closer stance with Ming China, which had intervened on Korea’s behalf.
