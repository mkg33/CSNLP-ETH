Absolutely.
I do not agree with the reactionary men here.
But I sympathise with them.
Korea is a hyper competitive society.
It's almost unimaginable how much pressure there is compared to the West.
This means everything from looks, dress, exams, job, etc.
They call it 'Hell Joseon' for a reason.
And young men resent having to give up 18 months (was 2 years until recently) in the prime of their life to live in an abusive military bootcamp that drives many to suicide.
I can see why that breeds resentment.
It's a complex issue.
I still think it is mostly reactionary nonsense, but I also understand (if not agree with) the resentment.
> Honestly, I am skeptical there would be any way to end this 'gender war' without abolishing conscription system.
Of course, most 'feminist' group support abolishing it - but many of them also support 'tweaking' compensation as well, so it's hard for young men to see them in a good light, given that almost everyone expects that 'conscription system' will persist for at least decades.
