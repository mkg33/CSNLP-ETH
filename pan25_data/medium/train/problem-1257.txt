But I'll just touch on a couple of things you "absolutely know".
Producing enough power for a tank in a package that can be armored, maintained and housed is an incredibly sophisticated engineering challenge.
There are only so many ways to achieve a viable product within the framework and those designs are under patent protection.
You can either ignore every patent like Russia does and take whatever tech you want to produce what you want o produce.
Second, you can try to come up with an entirely new way to achieve that design, which is immensely difficult to do for a such mature technology as icu's.
If you can't come up with that miraculous new design, you'll end up with an inferior product, which is unacceptable for a weapon system where you want to outmatch your rivals.
And lastly, you can license an existing design.
I go to a Turkish tailor occasionally.
Heâ€™s been around forever and is the nicest guy.
Last I was there, which was pre-Covid, his daughter had just married a Turk and moved over there.
