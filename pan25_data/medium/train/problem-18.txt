So as to be clear, Michigan voters voted this in; Michiganaders signed petition to get this onto ballot, by law the Republican legislature got it, then amended it, weakened it, before becoming law?
edit: Voters never got to vote on it; the legislature took it up beforehand, weakened it, then passed and signed into law by governor.

Thank you, you are correct; yes, the petition signatures were validated by state board of canvassers, the legislature adopted it, then amended it and passed it as law, stretching the min wage increases out slowly reaching 2030.
Otherwise, they could have refused it and it would go to the voters by law - they couldn't have that else they'd lose, rat bastards.
Thank You again; need to refresh memory at times.
In general, be courteous to others.
