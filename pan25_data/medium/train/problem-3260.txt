This bullshit myth is just an excuse that companies sell to morons to convince them that they have no legal way to decline immoral business.
No, the goddamn DOJ is not going to punish private business for refusing to do business with hostile foreign entities, and companies routinely decline potentially profitable business for any number of reasons, including PR and ethics.
They do have a fiduciary duty, however if they can provide a plausible explanation for why they think it is best to pull out of China they should be safe.
Then there are factors like having them reliant on our tech vs. letting them reverse engineer things.
That's HBM2 memory, it's not for data centers or gaming.
It's for machine learning and other computational applications.
Universities and research labs will be the main buyers for these.
I bet the equation is pretty complex.
They get tech, we get their money.
It's not like we're giving it away.
I'm sure it's motivated by greed, but at the same time I think trade between our country is anything but simple.
And, if we suddenly stopped working with China.
The economy crashes.
I mean like disaster crash.
Worldwide disaster.
Besides living through the economic hardship, ring wing crazies could come into our government and turn America into an Autocracy.
And probably all around the rest of the world.
