Was in São Paulo and Rio past 2 months.
Uber is criminally cheap in Brasil.
We are talking about $2-4 for a long drive in heavy traffic.
Maybe Uber subsidizes the losses but man I don’t know how the drivers make anything.
Honestly its like that in a ton of places in Central/South America.
Panama City, San Jose(costa rica), Bogota/Medellin/Cartagenta(colombia), Belmopan(belize).
That's just the places where I've had a 30 minute+ uber ride for under $5.
Taxi drivers in LatAm scam and rob people all the time, even locals dont trust them, especially local women.
.So sadly the alternatives are Not-Ubers (Cabify, DiDi)and the bus which isnt feasible at night for its own reasons.
of course just its because its a natural equilibrium doesnt mean the natural equilibrium is fair or just - but we all already know this because we live in societies where some people have billions and others starve.
They already get away with not paying fair wages because the system is already at equilibrium paying unfair wages - this is how capitalism works - because, surprise, the system is already inherently unfair.
