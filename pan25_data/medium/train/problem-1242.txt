Let me get this straight Mr. Reynolds…you get this straight, you get your information from a book you’ve never read based on a willingness to believe, a desiredness to accept.
A leap of, dare I say it, faith??
?
Which is insane, considering they are very loud about being patriotic in the South.
I grew up in Texas, and I don't see the Confederates as anything but traitors.
Anybody that flies the Confederate flag is objectively a fucking moron.
I never got that, but I have met many southerners who are still rock, flag, and eagle.
Still have talked to others who have the other opinion and blame the democrats (ironically since Dems where the popular ones there until like the 50s).
No I get that but they still rebelled against the Union so I have little sympathy for them especially with the south’s willingness to build monuments to those who rebelled against the Union.
Their monuments belong in a museum but other than that I don’t support their exoneration on state sponsored land.
You lost, get over it and accept your spot in American history.
We all have a lot to learn from history, especially the wrong sides of it so we can move forward.
Well said, it was a rough campaign to legitimize northern control while hurting the southern economy.
Like I feel bad but I also kinda don’t as a means to an ends.
Tough spot to find yourself in.
It was the most expedient yet near guaranteed solution.
That march to the sea undoubtedly saved lives.
Still, ballsy move.
That was definitely old school.
Like Genghis Khan old school.
