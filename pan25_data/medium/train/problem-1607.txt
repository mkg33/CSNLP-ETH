When I was little, I wanted to live forever, to see what the promised wonders of the future were to be had.
Now that I'm older, I'm glad that I'll die some day!
I feel like the jade colored glasses and bitterness comes after the anxiety settles.
It goes from "Oh my god, the world is ending!
".
many people my age (late 20s) are just opting to not have kids or adopt for this reason.
i was briefly engaged and it was frightening having to worry about the future again.
In my interpretation, "whine" is more about the sound being made.
I associate it with the way a toddler complains about their sibling being mean to them; higher pitched than normal speaking, and with more pout...
Whereas "whinge" is just about complaining - at great lenh.
Probably with a normal voice, but going on and on about all the bad stuff in a somewhat self-indulgent way.
Both "whinge" and "whine" have negative connotations.
Both are about being upset about something.
But whine -> the sound; and whinge -> the complaints.
I mean, at least they're admitting we're too dumb to figure out how to fix the problem.
It's better than knowing the solution and not using it because it just isn't "good business sense".
We even tried paying the companies to promise that they'd pollute less.
And they pink-promise that they are 'investing' that money to persuade someone one, somewhere else, to pollute less instead - and they have a true-blue real-deal 'carbon credit' to prove it.
Unfortunately, although the complex twists of carbon accounting may be enough to keep the coal burning - it is not enough to trick the laws of physics.
We're still going to actually need to stop.
Like, properly stop.
Net zero!
The same polluters spewing more crap into the air than ever before, but it is 'offset' by someone saying that they'll hold off on destroying something they were previously planning to destroy.
