Individual 1 showed the world how to beat the GOP, just punch them in the mouth and keep going.
They have no policy to speak of and its just bullshit woke garbage they talk about.
If they want to hit you on gun control, just say i don't care if you own a gun i just want gun owners to be responsible and if your an irresponsible gun owner you need to pay the price.
Just make the distinction that you have policy ideas and they don't.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
