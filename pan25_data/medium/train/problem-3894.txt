I’m Texan and have a decent grasp on local politics.
The issue with Crenshaw was actually the complete opposite of what you’re describing.
He wasn’t leaning into the depths of the far-right as they had desired.
He got John McCain’d basically, but instead of “I don’t like people who get captured” it was “I don’t like people who criticize my own party and even share one opinion with a librul” - he was getting shouted down here by the far right in a GOP primary with 3 candidates.
He just has incumbent’s advantage versus two candidates who were somehow worse than him.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
