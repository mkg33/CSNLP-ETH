Once all Russian troops have left, then the diplomatic process can begin.
This will likely include (not not be limited to) reparations to help Ukraine recover from what Russia did, sending the millions of Ukrainians kidnapped/human trafficked into Russia back to Ukraine, and cooperating with international war crimes trials.
That would just prolong the war, since any temporary peace at this point will just give some time for Putin to prepare for another even bloodier invasion.
Maximizing the civilian casulties like that doesn't really sound better than the alternatives.
Agreed, but in this case the status quo was interrupted by the aggressor.
Diplomacy is the opposite of using coercive force to change the status quo….
Edit: to be clear, diplomacy is maintaining the status quo (in this case: reciprocity and order) by using cooperative aspirations.
We all want diplomacy, but Russia has been saying “stop hitting yourself, stop hitting yourself” since the HOLODOMOR.
The ball is not really in Ukraine’s court.
