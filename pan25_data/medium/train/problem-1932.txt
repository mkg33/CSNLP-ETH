Only 30% of claimants are accepted.
In 2023, Canada believes it will receive between 55,000 and 79,000, refugee claimants - mostly from people crossing the border with the United States.
If only 30% are accepted in Canada, that's between 38,500 and 55,300 who will be rejected and who will have to be deported.
At $150,000 / person, that will cost the Canadian taxpayers between $5,755 billion and $8.295 billion.
Canada only has 10% of the US's population.
Therefore, in US terms, that's like the US having to expend between $57.55 billion and $82.95 billion because another country can't control its own borders.
(And we all know how upset the US becomes when that sort of thing happens).
In general, be courteous to others.
