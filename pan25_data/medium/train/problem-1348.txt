When I saw on the news feed that damn near everybody was covering this in the media, I went straight to Reddit to see what the discussion was like.
And I couldn't find it on r/all and I didn't see it here either.

Guessing this will be removed since it’s not (or shouldn’t be political) but give me a break.
The DoE is not an expert on viruses and this is a low confidence estimate.
Which is basically them shrugging their shoulders and saying “maybe but we don’t know.”.
And that was the scariest thing.
It feels like this story is being ignored by the left, at least on Reddit.
Because I don't think we need to agree with anything or whatever, but we should at least be informed about something.
The right wing is definitely going to make a circus out of.
It's inconclusive at best.
People who look for an actual scientific basis for things aren't getting excited.
That translated in your mind into "being ignored by the left?"
That's a bit of a leap.
EDIT: Just to say, I'm not a lab leak promoter.
I just think this is an interesting political football that will get passed around.
I'm not talking about the underlying scientific evidence of the lab league, I'm talking about a major United States department making this statement.
That is big news.
