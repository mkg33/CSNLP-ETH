Every study suggests that workers are a lot more content/productive having that extra day and it has little/no impact (or even a positive) affect on the bottom line of companies.
I'm usually so burnt out/tired that Friday evening doesn't feel all that different than a regular weekday outside of the fact that I'm not dreading work and can sleep in.
Saturdays are then usually eaten up by chores, errands, or things I otherwise don't have time/the energy to do during the week.

I believe it.
I feel so recharged after a 3 day weekend.
2 days just isn't enough.
Basically I sleep in to decompress from the work week on Saturday, then I may go out since I don't have work the next day.
Then Sunday has the cloud of having work tomorrow hanging over it.
Feels like I only get one day of true rest.
Then come Sunday, I feel that dread/stress come back or I am otherwise "preparing for Monday."
(granted I have a high stress/pretty toxic job which makes it hard to decompress).
3 day weekends are about the only time I feel like I'm "allowed" to have a "do absolutely nothing" day.
It's purposely why I tend to stagger all my vacation time with holidays.
