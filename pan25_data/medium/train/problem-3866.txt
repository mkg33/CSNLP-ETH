Moldova is an EU candidate country, it would be wise for Europeans to have a joint military operation to at least monitor the situation there and assist Moldovian security forces if an attack happens.
This doesn't even require weapons, just good intelligence and reconnaissance as information control is the core of Russia's paramilitary strategy.
This can also be done independently of the US/NATO, and arguably should be to show that Europe can be unified and defeat Russia without American assistance.
Poland is certainly ready to help, as are Romania and Italy.
It’s hard for the Europeans to have a joint military operation there, because Article 11 of the Moldovan constitution explicitly states that “The Republic of Moldova will not admit the stationing of any foreign military troops on its territory”.
Even allowing unarmed European troops in would place the Moldovan government in breach of the constitution.
And the current government does not have sufficient power in parliament to unilaterally change the constitution.
If you wonder how the Russians can keep soldiers in Transnistria… that agreement predated the Moldovan constitution and was not replaced by the constitution.
