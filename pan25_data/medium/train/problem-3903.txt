the phrase first appeared in the late 16th century, after a book called “Domostroy” (“Household”) was published.
This book, a guide for families, carried a strong Orthodox Christian message.
It outlined women’s obedience as the key to a strong, lasting family, and described corporal punishment — for women and children — as a “mere blessing” that can help “avoid death of the soul.”.
Civilians have been streaming out of the southern Ukrainian city whose recapture they had celebrated just weeks earlier but which has come under days of Russian artillery attack.
The exodus from Kherson came as Ukraine solemnly remembered a Stalin-era famine and sought to ensure that Russia's war in Ukraine doesn't deprive others worldwide of its vital food exports.
A line of trucks, vans and cars, some towing trailers or ferrying out pets and other belongings, stretched nearly a mile on the outskirts of the city on Saturday.
Days of intensive shelling by Russian forces prompted a bittersweet exodus: many civilians were happy that their city had been won back, but lamented that they couldn't stay.
At least 32 people in the Kherson region had been killed by Russian shelling since pro-Moscow forces pulled out two weeks ago, the head of Ukraine's police said on Saturday.
I honestly just wish the US would declare war on Russia and go at it.
We need to get this shit over with.
It's getting old.
Until we have to sanction China and that hits us back home.
Iran uses sanctions as an excuse to bring people in line with a common enemy and quell the rebellion.
There are more things they have to consider.
I just cannot believe that a country is allowed to kidnap on a mass level.
Basically kidnapping half the city and ppl are finding mass graves with the bodies showing signs of obvious torture.
This must be stopped immediately and not allowed by anyone no matter what weaponry they have in their arsenal.
