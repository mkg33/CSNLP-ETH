I’m not defending the GOP at all, but my understanding was that they highly encouraged him to withdraw because it was becoming a distraction from their great and noble work /s.
It’s so wild to me that this guy is still not only in office, but on powerful committees and acting with total impunity.
He is a ridiculous criminal lowlife, the kind of person who’d fail a background check to get hired at McDonald’s.
Santos’s very presence in our government is so emblematic of how dysfunctional our country has become.
It’s also revealing of how low Trump set the fucking bar for ethics and integrity.
EDIT/CORRECTION: He is no longer on any committees, thank God.
Still not remotely cool that he's in office, though.
