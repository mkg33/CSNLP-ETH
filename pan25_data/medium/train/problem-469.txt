There are other weapons they can perform an attack with.
Russians lost many tanks, which weakened their abillity to penetrate Ukrainian defence lines.
Kalibr and Iskander are guided precisions weapons which can be used to destroy important targets like munitions depots, hardpoints, artillery, air defence deeper behind Ukrainian lines.
Once those get depleted Russians can do only artillery shelling and motorized infantry pushes which is inaccurate or airstrikes with jets and helicopters whichwill be intercepted with air defence.
After russians deplete their guided missiles, Ukrainians can then move closer to the front their artillery, mrls, air defences, munitions depots without worrying about them to be destroyed.
"We had these Iranian missiles for an incredibly long time but only just started using them now despite them being objectively much more effective than our own".
I'm actually fairly sure Russian Iskanders are better than anything Iran can or is willing to hand over.
It's still really bad obv that they're going to have them, but Russia will definitely regret wasting so many of their high end missiles on schools and shopping centers in a few months.
I was thinking this the other day, Putin is going to throw everything he has at levelling schools and power stations in Ukraine and end up getting a tap on the shoulder from Xi standing there with a pointy stick and a list of demands.
