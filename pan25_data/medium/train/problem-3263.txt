After the invasion in Ukraine, the German government nationalized Russian assets and infrastructure within Germany, as Russia simply stopped running the infrastructure.
The deal wasn't with Russia, the deal was with a subsidiary based in Germany, and after the war started, that subsidiary was nationalized by the German government.
India is still holding that subsidiary accountable for the deal, regardless of which country owns it.
India and Russia made deals – before the war in Ukraine – about LNG supplies.
Apparently, Russia handled it via a subsidiary located in Germany.
The deal was made with Gazprom (here Gazprom Germania subsidiary).
Gazprom is the Russian state owned energy company.
So yes, the deal was made with Russia about Russian LNG for a direct delivery from Russia to India.
It seems Russia is not following through with the deal they have made with India.
Now India wants the deal with Russia about Russian LNG to be handled by Germany.
Which of course has no say or access regarding Russian deals or resources.
