>We know that it is wrong to make fun of people for their physical characteristics.
Please be aware that our ambassador was not making light of the fact that Vladimir Putin is only 5'4".
What our diplomat was saying was his actions are that of a "small man" as in small in comparison to a great man, not "small man" in reference to Vladimir Putin's height, which is only 5 feet 4 inches.
There have been many great men who were also short.
While he is now actually known to be average height for his time, Napoleon has been remembered in history as a short man and this never stopped people from recognizing his great impact.
I apologize sincerely for any misunderstanding.
Actually those are mercenaries.
Wagner said only it's troops are operating at Soledar today.
They sent VDV to Bakhmut to break the impasse there, Wagner devised a plan and then executed it.
The plan was to get so far to the west to block the only supply route with artillery fire.
It kinda sorta worked.
However Ukrainian aviation solved at least some of the issues.
Also Wagner doesn't have much artillery ammo after Ukrainian raid two days ago.
