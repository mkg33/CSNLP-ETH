Ah, no.
Many of us we’re watching anxiously as the pandemic grew-China and Iran and other countries.
The videos of the body bags, crematoriums operated 24/7, children gasping for breath in mass auditorium style make shift hospitals.
Crews spraying an unknown chemical on streets and sidewalks.
People being put in trucks much like a dog catcher’s truck.
Drones telling people to go back inside.
Chinese officials welding people in their buildings.
We’ve seen it before.
And that was December 2019.
Why it struck China way harder than other countries is anyones guess and why they tried to suppress it are mysteries to me.
To make matters worse, once Trump tried to downplay it as well, the sources for the information, like newsFoS sub and others got taken over by deniers and conspiracy kooks and china cracked down on the people who shared the information outside China.
I remember being in my university class reading headlines along the lines of "surge in pneumonia like disease surprise officals" in November 2019.
Thought nothing of it and mid march my uni went online because a single person went to a hospital for a couple hours where a single potentially active case was being tested.
Shit went fast and hard in the beginning.
