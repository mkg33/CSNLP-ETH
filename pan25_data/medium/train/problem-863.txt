A lot of media is lazy and does not actually provide value.
I don't need to be told I should be angry about a stupid, hateful tweet; if I want to be angry, I can just read the tweet.
I don't need a journalist to tell me what Joe at the diner in Ohio says about the economy (we have diners full of idiots here too); I need a journalist to dig in and tell me what's actually going on.
And it's not the job of journalism to merely repeat that the Democrats say it's raining and the Republicans say the sky is clear.
It's their job to look out the goddamn window and report the truth.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
