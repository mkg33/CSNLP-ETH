Man, against all odds conservationists have made some big wins this year.
We’ve got a long way to go on a very scary road, but it really feels like the tides are turning.
Thank you to everyone who’s helped shift public opinion and policy towards saving our planet.
I think 41000 animals were added to the endangered list this year.
While getting the odd animal numbers up we are still destroying far faster than creating.
Also we arent doing anything against climate change on any reasonable level.
India is gonna be unlivable in about a decade which includes thousands of animal species.
This is a win but we are down about 10000-1.
We are doing tons of stuff to mitigate climate change.
The problem is, none of it involves instant miracle fixes or salacious scandal, so it doesn’t get the media traction or attention doomer stuff does.
I work in renewable energy infrastructure and water conservation.
While we’re definitely still against the wall and things are dire, there are also so many things happening that give me real hope.
The promising tech breakthroughs and the sheer shift in public sentiment are what keep me going some days.
One thing we collectively might need to wrap our heads around is that there’s never going to be a day where we wake up and suddenly everything is better.
It’s going to be millions of tiny victories like this, built by the millions of people working every day to make things better.
That’s the rising tide that changes everything.
