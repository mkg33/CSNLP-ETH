I'm out of the loop on this... Why is congress/president determining the outcome of labor negotiations so specifically instead of just providing assistance?
If the workers wanted sick time, and they're not getting it, why would they just end their strike based on this deal?
Why are the rail companies pushing back so hard on what's being asked for when the alternative is clearly a massive shock to supply chains.
Can they not afford what's being asked for?
Why is Congress not telling them to fix the problem or subsidizing them to fix this immediately?
If we are so dependent on this company (companies?
), they should either get hit with antitrust violations and broken up, or they should be socialized for having a natural monopoly.
I get that policy is complicated, but this just seems baffling to me.
