I really hope that electoral democracy isn't something that only works in European-based and (maybe) rapidly-aging East Asian-based societies.
It seems the new constitution was adopted with a 95% yes vote but on a 30% turnout because the opposition boycotted the vote.
However it's been brought in anyway and this is the result.
A real shame.
I remember last time I checked in on Tunisia people were describing it as a real story of democratic reform succeeding.
I guess a lot can happen in a year or so.
All is not lost.
Remember that democracy is an extremely new idea for the Arab world, whereas Europe has been trying it from time to time from the Greeks and Romans to now.
A lack of democracy in the Middle East is primarily due to regional and some international meddling.
UAE and Saudi Arabia have outright said they wonâ€™t allow for democratic reforms in the region and will roll back the Arab Spring (Tunisia, Egypt) and any subsequent revolutions (Sudan).
Iran is doing much of the same, violently trying to keep its sycophants in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon in power.
