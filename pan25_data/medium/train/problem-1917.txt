This war is going to be all about dictatorships and the free world.
So whether there will be a free world where territorial boundaries are respected or countries can bully and take what they want is going to be determined.
All democracies need to support Ukraine and support their fight for freedom or the world will be a scarier place.
Most importantly there needs to be a war crimes tribunal where the consequences of leaders decisions must be dealt with so they realize there is no free pass anymore and threatening nuclear weapons is off limits.
Worst part is now we are going to hear the hundreds of stories of rape, pillaging, and forced evacuation carried out by the Russians.
Ukraine will be one giant issue of PTSD after this is all done.
I'm in Canada and a simple worker but I will personally donate money to any mental health services aid that starts up after the war.
You'll all need it.
My friend in Chernihiv is also suffering the same jumpiness as you are.
She says almost everyone there is stressed.
