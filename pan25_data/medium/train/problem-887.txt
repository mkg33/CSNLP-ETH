I mean I figured it was proposed to turn people off of reparations, that the entire point of proposing it was to make reparations look bad and give right wingers more things to rag on California liberals for.
Yeah, no one actually think that’s going to happen.
Reparations are good and there’s a perfectly reasonable argument for them.
But $5 million per person not only won’t happen, even suggesting it just gives Right-Wing news outlets fodder for their perpetually furious base.
So a bunch of folks talking about how much reparations should be with no real course of action to make it happen?
Might want to add some diversity to the group... unless the group only wants members who will receive the money..
I'm not sure where your issue with my comment is tbh, showing me the committee isnt going to change anything lol.
Have a good night, i've got notifications for this off now.

Please if you have any questions or concerns.
yeah and so am i lol.
I believe it was a serious proposal, I just also question the motives of whomever was on this committee.
One would think said committee would propose something a bit more reasonable if they weren't trying to make the idea less palatable, $5m per person to me seems like trying to make reparations look worse to white people than they already do, hopefully turning off some of the less conservative whites like myself who support the general idea of some sort of reparations in the process.
And it'll work.
