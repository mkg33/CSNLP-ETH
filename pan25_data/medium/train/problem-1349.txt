I'm not a languageologist so you may have to do some research on this, but i dont believe making a legal challenge is "betraying one's country".
Even if she has some twisted beliefs about election integrity.
This has all played out in court, not in a dictionary.
Make sure you're bringing the right books to the conversation.
ffs, its not "treason".
Can we stop throwing that word at every belligerent asshole who cant accept reality?
She wasnt aiding or abetting or levying war against the US.
She was running for office and is a sore loser.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Is she contributing to a better democracy in the US?
no, absolutely not.
Is what she's doing 'treason'?
no, absolutely not.
Words mean things, lets at least try to use the right word for the situation.
Is she a victim of conspiratorial thinking?
yes.
Has she committed treason?
no.
To be clear, I have no dog in this fight.
I just want to point out that I think the distinction between you and those arguing with you is Lake’s intent.
You’ve asserted a few times that Lake was the “victim” of conspiratorial thinking and legally challenged the election.
That implies that you feel she is acting in good faith.
So she’s just a sore loser.
So to be clear, idgaf is Kari Lake plays in traffic.
I'm not interested in her political views or her policy positions (if they exist).
But as far as i can tell, she went to court to legally challenge the outcome of the election she lost.
Thats it.
