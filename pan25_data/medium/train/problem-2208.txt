My interpretation of this action is that India is negotiating with the US and EU on terms of an agreement to turn on Russia.
This is mostly PR posturing to indicate they could stick with Russia as a credible option.
We’ll know things are getting serious when we hear talk of cutting off India from uranium supplies.
It’ll be over when either it’s announced or we cut India off from the USD.
It is clear Russia is desperate.
Presumably they can obtain at least some of the parts they need from black markets but who knows what the origin and quality of the product is.
The article does not state what India included in the response, but given that even China is hesitant on aircraft parts seems like a big risk if they do assuming they contain "western" technology.
Short-sighted profiteering, alas expected based on failure to even condemn Russia so far.
Interesting to see if aircraft / parts are provided, if they are that could have big repercussions.
So; they lost their wealthiest customers and somehow are in a strong negotiation position with storages full, quickly rising transportation costs and a losing war that is draining reserves faster than they can be replenished?
Again one cannot trust anything that manure generating regime is spewing.
