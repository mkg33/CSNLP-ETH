Screw Caruso.
I used to work at one of his malls.
He charged a "discounted" 25 dollars per day for mall employees.
Then when employees parked in the nearby neighborhood he went around posting sandwichboard signs on the streets saying "Employee Parking in Residential Areas Prohibited."
It just had "Caruso" at the bottom; it wasn't legally enforceable at all.
The lenhs he would go to to intimidate retail and restaurant workers into paying his exorbitant parking rate disgusted me.
He wanted us to think maybe those signs carried legal weight or we might get in trouble with our bosses.
Imagine the kind of strong-arm tactics he would have employed as mayor.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

Interesting that you blame people like Karen Bass for something when you say you're aware it was the fault of Reagan and people who are more like Caruso...
