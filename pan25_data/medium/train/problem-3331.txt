Iowa isn't the absolute worst state to be 1st, but its absolutely far from the best.
West of Des Moines and yeah, its basically Nebraska/South Dakota.
But the tech corridor of University of Iowa with its educational hospital, aerospace companies (BAE and Collins Aerospace), etc.
Its not all bad.
Iowa city is one of the most liberal and educated cities (town more like) in the Country.
But those are tiny specks of bright shining blue in an ocean of racist, backward-ass rural good ole boys.
I'll be glad to see Iowa knocked down a peg (or two) in the political gamesmanship.
