That said, I'm pretty sure that an officer who does so sacrifices part (or possibly all) of the their retirement pay to do so, along with all of their military privileges.
Because of this, it is very rarely done.
This may sound unfair, but remember that officers don't really retire, they simply leave active service.
Part of the reason officers get substantially more pay, both while serving and after retirement, is that they can be recalled to service at any time, without warning.
This is part of what they agree to when accepting a commission and is well understood.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
