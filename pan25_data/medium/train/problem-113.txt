It's the standard fall back Iran and dictatorships use for anyone they want to punish... call them Spy's.
What a deplorable piece of shit regime these people are.
Yeah and that.
Tourists are spy's because they have pictures on their phones and travelled around the place.. you know, like normal tourists.
How any decent government can give these gangster regimes any official recognition is beyond me.
But there they will be shaking hands with Iranian officials at the UN or other event.
I've always wanted to visit Iran as I like historical places.
But think be way too stupid/dangerous to go now with what they are doing to their own people and foreigners.
Hostage taking has been part of Iran's foreign policy for decades.
It might be best if nobody ever traveled to Iran even if part of an aid mission.
Just cut the country off and forbid travel there for any and all reasons.
Hopefully one day I'll be able to go.
I've been to many countries and always find the local people are amazing and usually just the government's that give everyone a bad rep.
