Same question.
Ya had war 70 years ago, so everyone else,.. just take chill pill and feed ya ppl.
Is the South Korea proof enough that they have nothing to worry about.
Ah yes but in that case who would kept little Kimchi as warlord.
It reminds me of this cheesily-militaristic, Charge-of-the-Light-Brigade-style speech NK gave in regard to a ski resort they built ten years ago.
As for the "shock brigades," I quote Joshua Stanton in an article he wrote about the construction of a tourist resort KJU built AFTER the ban on tourism in NK.
It is not even communist system at this point.
It is some weird feudal lord, isolationist, leader worshipping regime.
The communists are authoritarian, but there is some kind of check and balance between the politburo (there are usually 4 positions, and each of those guys try to undermine the other 3).
This is a 30 something years old assholes doing whatever he feel like doing and no one oppose it.
I mean the globe is hella competitive now.
Even powerful nations get an industry wiped out every now and then because another powerful nation did it better.
North Korea?
Fuck man I don't know.
