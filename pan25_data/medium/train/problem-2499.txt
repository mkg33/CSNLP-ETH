>The US population are fear addicts, and the gov.
needs you to keep freaking out again and again about Russia and China cause fear is easy to manipulate, and thus what they did this time around was let a random stupid chinese balloon come all the way over to the US - NORAD was already tracking it for months as we already know - so you could freak out about being attacked, again.
These are ple-planned fearmongering news.
Like clockwork there's another fabricated story every few months so you can keep freaking out about your "enemy".
Why not shoot it down earlier and let it come?
Because it's convenient to let it come.<.
Since it was a false alarm the post was appropriately removed and given the usual "US internal news" flair.
There were two Stratotankers near the eastern part of Washinon, too.
You could track them until they turned off their transponders for security reasons.
Doesn’t seem too unusual.
Lines up with the prior narrative of them being a nuisance that is worth shooting down (even just for political points), but not an active threat.
Conditions likely weren’t suitable, and it isn’t in a position to cause active harm, so they delayed it until the morning.
