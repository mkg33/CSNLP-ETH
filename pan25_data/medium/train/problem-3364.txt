If you grow up in a society like this and as you get older, nothing changes, and you become more cynical, it’s incredibly easy to think that it’s like this everywhere else.
That this IS the normal.
That the west and everybody who declares that their lives are so much better… they MUST be all lying somehow, pretending.
Like Putin cannot imagine - truly imagine - that the countries bordering Russia in the west (esp those that were part of the USSR) truly and well wanted to get away from Russia in every single way possible as far as they could.
No - it MUST’ve been US and the others pushing these countries; by buying up their politicians; by using coercion and manipulation and dirty money.
They cannot imagine that people truly and well wanted to get away from Russia and that the only explanation as to their vitriol must be that someone has been pulling the strings.
In their eyes, Ukraine and Ukrainians - they don’t have an agenda.
They’re like a organism that doesn’t have a mind of its own - it gets pushed and pulled according to the whims of others.
Yeah, that’s a brilliant idea.
Start an official world war by directly attacking a western country when you’re having enough trouble with the one you illegally invaded a year ago.
That’ll go over well.
