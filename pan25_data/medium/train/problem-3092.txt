However, thanks to Western training and materiel support and Russian corruption and incompetence, AFU units are qualitatively superior to their Russian counterparts.
As the Ukrainians themselves readily admit, they're lucky that the opposition is so goddamned stupid; this stupidity has largely neutralized any potential advantage that the Russians had.
The Russians have also pissed away materiel that they can't afford to waste on civilian targets for very little gain; the Ukrainians are very much aware that this is a war for survival, and if rolling blackouts are the price to pay for survival they'll gladly pay it.

Ukraine is taking significant loses.
They are taking the same amount of military loses as Russia plus civilian according to US estimates.
Our news is only highlighting Russian loses as a morale booster and because that is what people want to hear.
This has been pretty 50/50 though.
