At the end is a clip of Vladimir Putin saying they have the right to destroy anyone who threatens to destroy Russia and it'll be a global catastrophe, but what do they need the world for if there's no Russia.
Absolute insanity.
Exactly.
If Russia truly broke up and the ethnic Republics were fully independent, then they could form an actual union starting with free trade then free movement etc, rather than everything created in Russia being siphoned to Moscow, leaving the countryside poor and the people fleeing the country.
The fact that the Russian government thinks this is doing anything other than making them look pathetic, or the fact that there are people that actually buy this bullshit.
Then you haven't seen their add showing how poor poor western Europeans are eating their hamster pets in cold homes this winter...
Look at the comments under the video, the ones in russian...
Sometimes, I almost pity them.
Then I look at what "common people" are saying and get the reminder, that's not just putin's or kremlin war.
It's a fucking love ballad to a nuclear missile, the Sarmat, talking about how they're happy and ready to launch it.
An actually well put together country of actually sovereign states could become a great place to live.
