Just to clarify as the translation is somewhat cloudy in that aspect.
The first 8 people group is equipped with 8 RPO-A (or -M) Шмель ("Shmel" - Bumblebee ).
It's a rocket launcher that as ammo is using thetmobaric capsules designed to destroy fortified positions from up to 450m.
They are also equipped with other stuff.
The only task of this group is to make a fire contact.
They pass the information to artillery, which shells the defenders.
The group (if still alive) then proceeds to attack the defense position, previously marking their own position (i.e.
leaving a mark on a tree).
If the first group is dead, the second one is sent, without the equipment, as they are supposed to pick up the equipment from the first group bodies.
As they are much lighter equipped, they are much more agile and have higher chances to reach the position of the first group.
If they reach the position, they call the artillery and proceed to assault the defense position.
This process is repeat till the enemy position is taken (usually it's enough to send 4 groups in total, however in Soledar they had to send up to 14 such groups for single objective).
