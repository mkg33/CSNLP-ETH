If you want my opinion on this whole thing, of course he has a significant responsibility in the death toll.
But to be honest, I'm not sure that things would have been very different with someone else in power.
And I'm not sure things will be very different if an opposition party comes to power in May.
In any case, Istanbul is fucked.
There will be hundreds of thousands of casualties when the big one strikes the city.
In this disastrous economy, there's not enough time and money to destroy, rebuild, strenhen, renovate, etc.
And for that too he is partly responsible...
That might mean people died and cannot use their phones, people survived but lost their phones, people cannot find electricity to charge their phones etc.
Still, a very scary number.
Edit: I have heard this on a respectable tv program in Turkey but I cannot find another source to confirm the number.
Turkcell, the biggest mobile company in Turkey, announced that they have lost contact with 400,000 cell phones after the earthquake.
