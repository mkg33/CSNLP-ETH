Denmark will donate Leopard 1A5 tanks - a model that is no longer actively used by the Danish military but stored in Germany at the company FFG.
It is not immediately clear to me based on the wording in the article exactly how many tanks Denmark will donate.
The article mentions that Germany has greenlit 187 Leopard 1's - 99 of which are from FFG.
So in reality it's not Denmark as such that are donating these?
Seems to me they were bought in 2010 by a german company FFG, and it's them who are donating their 99 Leopards, right?
Dutch media now also confirming Dutch involvement and repeating the 100+ figure.
I don't think there are any Leopard 1s left in Dutch storage, but they will likely help out financially like with the Czech T-72 program.
The joint Dutch-German-Danish announcement has been published among other places, and it includes the following interesting line:
"Our "Leo 1 A5 Initiative" is open to further partners.
So far, Belgium has also shown initial interest to participate.
".
Are these tanks combat effective?
I mean used in Bosnia 1994?
If WWI tanks were deployed in WWII they would be lit up by Panzers and T34s and Shermans.
Perhaps this could indicate the former Belgian vehicles stored and maintained by could be in play too, even though there are still some question marks about the price asked by OIP for their services.
I try to keep track of these rumors and announcements closely as I run /r/MilitaryProcurement, but I didn't see this one from my own government coming!
