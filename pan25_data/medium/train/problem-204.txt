China defacto takes over sri Lanka via debt collection or other countries give Sri Lanka the money to pay off China and tell them to fuck off but they then defacto belong to the countrie that bailed them out.
Before 1948, Sri Lanka was a plantation economy that produced tea, rubber, and coconuts, and a population of six million.
Today the population is 22 million people trying to be something they cannot.
Relying on other countries to give you money to survive is not a good long term strategy.
Sri Lanka is in the same boat as Lebanon and North Korea.
Recover to what?
Sri Lanka has been a basket case since independence in 1948.
The fundamental problem is borrowing money that cannot be repaid.
That has a solution, and it starts by telling the current creditors that their debt will not be repaid.
They'll get another loan from the IMF, but basically that just kicks the can down the road for a few months/years.
Longer-term is a bigger issue than just Sri Lanka.
"With its strategic location in the Indian Ocean Sri Lanka was expected to have a better chance than most other Asian neighbors to register a rapid economic take-off and had "appeared to be one of the most promising new nations."
But the optimism in 1948 had dimmed by 1960, due to wrong economic policies and mismanagement.
