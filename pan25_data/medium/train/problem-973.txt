We’re about 2 months from this being a US and China proxy war.
Can we please just look at the geopolitical ramifications of allowing Russia to try to invade a sovereign neighbor and using nukes as blackmail?
Russia or another version (USSR) have been our bad guys for decades.
They’re one nation away from invading a NATO ally.
If we stop giving aid to Ukraine, Poland is next, and then we’re obligated to provide both aid and personnel.
Ukraine has continuously proven they’ll shed their own blood to protect their right to exists.
The more we provide them the tools to protect their people and land, the less likely we’ll have to contribute our people when Russia “finds nazis” in Poland.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
