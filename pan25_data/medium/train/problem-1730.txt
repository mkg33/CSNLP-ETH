Spain has always had them, we had a fascist dictatorship until the mid 70s and it just finished with Franco dying of old age, the fascists were and are still around.
> Hours later, at around 9:00 p.m. on the same day, a second package addressed to the Instalaza de Zaragoza arms company was detected.
The company sent grenade launchers to Ukraine under the Russian invasion.
The Explosive Ordnance Disposal Specialist Technician (TEDAX) carried out a controlled detonation.
Watching Ant3 news and it seems not even the government is giving it much attention other than another standard terrorism investigation.

It’s been like an afterthought, I think this is quite significant.
I was surprised to see how many fascist sympathizing groups are active in Spain and Italy, organized fascist groups.
People need to remember Spain was under a dictatorship for many years, they were neutral in WWII, democracy is rather modern and relatively a “new” concept.
