That’s just from geopolitical analysis.
In one sense, if you ignore what the government of Russia is actually saying most of the time, you realize that all their moves are prompted by their geopolitical weaknesses, so the expansion of NATO influence into Ukraine being contested by Russia was virtually guaranteed in the 2010s.
It was really western media that completely misunderstood the degree to which this mattered to Russia.
One of the major things that kept Americans completely deluded about putin was how easily he lied to every single American president.
Everything since Gavrilo Princip’s decision to go have a sandwich after Nedeljko Čabrinović botched his attempted assassination has been a series of related historical events that got us here.
Pretty wild to think that quite literally every single event from 1914 to now only occurred because of happenstance.
If Princip wasn’t hungry an entirely different set of events would have occurred and an entirely different set of people would currently exist.
