Asteroids are waaaaaay more economically viable to mine, and we already have the technology to mine them.
Getting to Mars is a matter of human achievement and research opportunities.
There are virtually no economic drivers to reaching Mars or building a base, but we'll do it anyways.
There was no economic driver for the initial missions to the moon either.
Let me tell you about a little thing called "Defense Spending".
If China started building a giant space dildo, you better believe the US Space Force would want one even bigger .
I'm not seeing any significant value in opal, at least not space mission for mining type value.
Now, rare earth minerals (rare Mars minerals) that are used in microchips may be the ticket to Mars.
It is order of magnitudes simpler to mine asteroids.
I know people are pretty cynical and may never believe this, but I do believe we are going to land on Mars as a matter of human achievement.
There's nothing there for us economically.
Any mineral we could possibly find would probably also exist in asteroids, or be too expensive to bring back to earth on any kind of scale.
