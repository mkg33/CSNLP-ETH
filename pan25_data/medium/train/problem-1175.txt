It is generally treatable with antibiotics, but the article says that they will typically lose one or two children in the course of a year.
Having so many deaths this early in the season is unusual.
They do not believe that there is a new antibiotic resistant strain, however.
That is something of a relief.
I remember reading a book by Rosalynn Carter, whose father was a doctor.
In her book she described how her father had gone on a house call and came back to report that a patient had died of strep throat, noting that this is no longer considered a death sentence because of the advent of antibiotics.
It used to be that scarlet fever from complications of strep throat was the kids health horror story, much like leukemia in modern times (see Little Women, The Velveteen Rabbit, Dickens, and many other works), rather than "a week's misery, a course of antibiotics and a ton of chicken soup" like today.
Disease doesn't play around and modern medicine is a godsend.
During the measles outbreaks, I tried to point out on social media that there is actually no specific cure for the measles.
Instead, treatment is about the same now as it was in the 1920s.
Isolation, the control fever, rest and hydration, control pain.
You basically support the patient until their immune system is able to clear the virus.
Which is why vaccination is so damn important.
The immune system is really the only thing that ends many of these diseases once an infection is established.
Strep can be lethal, left unchecked.
I got it many, many times as a kid, usually got antibiotics and recovered just fine, but there was a bad ice storm in Dallas, Texas area one winter, and I went days without only for it to develop into scarlet fever, which can kill or inflict permanent cardiac damage.
Had to call a friend from across town with an all-terrain vehicle able to brave the ice and get to the hospital.
I still hate the taste of penicillin with a passion.
