Fun facts.
The sanctions placed on Belarus originally had nothing to do with its support for Russia.
They were there as a response to the crackdown on the 10 month long protests following the previous Belarussian election.
Lukashenko's grip on power was so tenuous that he was forced to call upon Russia to help put them down.
Somehow these sanctions have morphed from punishment of the Belarussian elite for their crackdown on the protests, to an attempt to 'encourage' the Belarussian people to rise up?
As if that didn't just fail recently?
We need to remember not every revolt ends the way Ukraine's does.
Many end the way the Belarus one did.
Some end up with you hiding in the closet crying on camera as you listen to the screams of your loved ones as government soldiers going room to room killing everyone they find (THAT was Iran just a few months back).
They also placed a round of sanctions in 2021 for the illegal grounding of that commercial jet liner while it travelled through Belarus airspace to arrest blogger Roman Protasevich.
I'm talking about the 2013-2014 Ukrainian protests and revolution that saw the pro-Russian Yanukovych (then Ukrainian president) chased out of Ukraine.
Makes you wonder where we'd be if Yanukovych had had the courage to hold out for Russian support.
Would Ukraine be like Belarus now, its population living with sanctions applied on Ukraine in an attempt to punish the old elite.
While we, brave and righteous redditors that we are, tell them to just revolt if they want the sanctions removed.
Would the Belarus attempt at freedom have ever happened?
You can certainly argue that the Russian response to the Belarus protests was modulated by their experience in Ukraine (where hardliners felt Putin wasn't quick enough to get support to Yanukovych).
