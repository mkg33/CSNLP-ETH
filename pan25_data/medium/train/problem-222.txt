oh I know - I'm not saying it's true.
it initially showed up on my news break app on my phone tho.
I do have a Twitter account but that's not where I saw it.
it popped up as an alert or text or whatever the fk.
That news break app kind of sucks - should probably just delete it.
But I'm sure if it got sent to me it got sent to millions of other people too.
it's not like I was on some conspiracy website somewhere looking for this.
I'm thinking it's possible the original balloon highlighted a blind spot in our defense and we corrected that.
If it doesn't end up being a gov, it would be interesting if it was some rich dude launching his own balloons, they're probably pricey but so are super cars.
Homer sinking back into the hedge rn.
11 yr old account vs 138 day account…I’ll let the rest of the Reddit community take from that what they will.
That's a metric but I don't find it useful.
I lost my 14 year old acct, gotta start again somewhere.
Point being there is no solid metric on how to evaluate accounts on a site that can essentially be 100% anonymous.
