She was an A+ student, PHENOMENAL artist, happily cycling between cities with us for fun, a huge, huge pile of college invitations, and since early Nov whammo, nearly bedbound.
No school since Nov, can't think, and even going out briefly to see friends makes her much worse the following days.
Every day for months, just trying to be patient with it and hope for recovery.
No idea if or when she'll improve, very little understanding or treatment from the doctors.
My daughter is one of these, although in the US.
We don't know if it was COVID or another virus that did it: ME/CFS, the condition that a lot of long COVID is included in, can be caused by like 12 viruses along with a host of other things.
Long COVID and ME/CFS are HORRIFIC.
And especially hitting kids who haven't even had their lives yet.
Research needs to get thoroughly on this.
I think the pressure to excel in school and the culture of treating it all like a competition is adding unneeded pressure.
We know that as long as she’s happy and relaxed she’ll have the fastest recovery and come out the other end swinging.
Wishing good health for her and good times for your family.
