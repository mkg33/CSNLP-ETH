Like, I myself don't even trust the military.
But I really don't believe that Elon Musk (and his whole staff) would 'accidentally' fail to disclose the actual costs of maintenance while they're jumping through all the hoops and paperwork to get their approval (and not just the pentagon's approval, but also the UK's and the Polish government's).
Something tells me that Elon Musk asked for a certain price, and was shot down by multiple panels of military tech-geeks.
Even Elon tried to claim that he had to 'raise' the price because his products couldn't withstand warzone conditions after just 6 months.
Imagine literally telling the US military--which had helped build and maintain more than 50 years-worth of satcoms--that they have failed to appreciate the costs and needs of Starlink.

The country has base stations working with batteries though electricity cannot be provided to some areas, the person said.
