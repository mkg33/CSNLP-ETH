Let’s get this straight.
The same type of journalist who called for Robert Malone and other alternate opinionated people to be censored for their (valid) stance on C19, are now outraged because Musk banned doxxing current location.
Super ironic and most of these journalists would want the same if they had people tracking them.
And now we find out the fbi and dnc worked together to censor valid opinions?
It’s almost like Musk isn’t the scary rich person ruining America that the left describes him as.
Musk is fighting AGAINST the kleptocracy and nobody in Reddit army is aware.
They still think the Biden laptop is about Hunters dick….
No, you ignorant buffoon.
Our own government can’t stop lying to us.
“Transitory inflation” my ass.
Good-bye middle class.
Kleptocrats dusted you, again.
It was kind of fun watching that burning trash can of Twitter for a while, but now it’s just getting old.
I hope EU guts the thing ASAP and Elon’s 44bln investment joins the dead space of Parler and Truth Social, catering to the uninformed uneducated QAnon idiots.
