Like it's always baffling in cartoons why these villains are running around causing mischief unchecked and how incompetent the police are in most of them, then you look at real life villains and think "surely these people are criminals and our justice system will hold them accountable" and then the worst thing they get slapped with is a fine and probation, meanwhile your buddy a couple of for down was playing in his yard with a nerf gun while being black and a cop driving up the road saw a black person with a (toy) gun and that made the cop "feel threatened" enough to shoot the kid six times in the back with no warning, investigations were blocked because of the police unions lawsuit about using the body camera footage in the courtroom, the cop "punished" with paid administrative leave for six months.
I dunno, trump has a habit of admitting to actual crimes so at this point I think there absolutely needs to be an investigation into this because of the possibility that it’s an actual crime he’s casually dropping because he’s throwing a tantrum.
