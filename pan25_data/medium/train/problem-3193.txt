Not exactly.
There’s a major forward sub base in Guam, and a major airbase on Okinawa (and a couple on the Japanese main islands + S. Korea).
These bases have the First Island Chain pretty well covered within their AOR, and more sub bases in Hawaii and the US West Coast can provide fairly rapid backup when needed, arriving in time to relieve the Guam-based assets after a tour in the area.
Any of those subs can make port and receive supplies and service from existing naval supply depots in Okinawa, Sasebo, Yokosuka, Busan, Subic Bay, and Singapore, and probably a couple other locations I’m not thinking of, plus a dozen smaller ports where the US has standing agreements for port visits and purchase of supplies.
If they take TSMC, then they effectively has a leverage over the global economy that they can politically utilize.
They are more likely to destroy TSMC in the process.
Which is still not too bad because it would force shifting to China for alternatives, such as they are.
It would also cause a major depression in global economy as supply chains collapse but China is willing to risk that (maybe).
