We need to make climate control affordable.
I pay over 1000 dollars to heat my house with oil but as a teacher with a teacher salary I can't afford to change from oil and get a whole new furnace and electric box.
The up front money needed is astronomical.
Similar with electric cars and other climate control methods of energy.
We want to make a difference but middle class just can't afford to event with tax rebates later on.
That way the furnace only kicks on when the heat pump can't keep up.
A had a friend do it last year and it dropped his heating bill (electric grid heat) 50%.
