> “I have broken more Elton John records.
He seems to have a lot of records.
And I, by the way, I don’t have a musical instrument.
I don’t have a guitar or an organ.
No organ.
Elton has an organ.
And lots of other people helping.
No, we’ve broken a lot of records.
We’ve broken virtually every record.
Because you know, look, I only need this space.
They need much more room.
For basketball, for hockey and all of the sports, they need a lot of room.
We don’t need it.
We have people in that space.
So we break all of these records.
Really, we do it without, like, the musical instruments.
This is the only musical – the mouth.
And hopefully the brain attached to the mouth, right?
The brain.
More important than the mouth is the brain.
The brain is much more important.”.
