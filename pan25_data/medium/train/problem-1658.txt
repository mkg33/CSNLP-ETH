I’d say yeah redistributing gerrymandering and changes to election laws and also intimidation and closing polling locations were some of the reasons… and mega churches telling their parishioners to vote Republican … and all the mass propaganda making democrats look evil… and dark money, corrupt candidates (giant douche or turd sandwich) have all played a part… and oh yeah does anyone remember how the post office had dejoy appointed and he immediately eliminated mail sorting machines and forbid employees from overtime - throwing away ballots because he made the mail take way longer.. or what about the lawsuit Bernie sander’s had against the Democratic Party because the votes were so close and Bernie probably got more votes… the judges decision was that since the Democratic Party is a private organization they can choose to run whoever despite if they had less votes… we need publicly funded elections more poll locations mail in voting and short term limits.
If NY and CA redistricting had been treated the exact same as FL, MI, LA, and NC, I don't think there'd have been much chance for the GOP taking the House from what number crunching friends and I did last month.
