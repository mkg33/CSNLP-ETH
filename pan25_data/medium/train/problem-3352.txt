From the article this is what I took, he was a prisoner in Russia, Wagner group did the rounds and he found him self on the front lines.
He was then captured, interviewed by the Ukrainians and he claimed his plan all along was to be captured and then join the fight against the Russians.
The Ukrainians published this but didn't enlist him, now he was either a) released to walk free in Kiev?
Very doubtful or b) sent back to Russia in a pow exchange.
Then he is abducted and executed with a sledge hammer.
A quick reminder: If trumpco and the GOP/GQP/republicans were in charge of the US at the moment, the US government would be providing aid to ruzzia... and NOT Ukraine.
Trump obviously has some sort of ties to Russia- seems like business or personal, but I doubt he’d ever support them militarily.
I’d say the worst he’d do is not support Ukraine and downplay the war while staying out of it.
Trump has already sold nuclear secrets to every dictator and depot in the world, but he wouldn’t support his puppeteer militarily…that’s classic.
That’s good.
