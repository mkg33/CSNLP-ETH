Sadly being sick would likely have just meant they were straight murdered instead of shipping them anywhere.
I’ve read a lot about the holocaust and they just shot people who weren’t well enough to travel.
Their whole goal was to exterminate the Jews, they sure as shit weren’t concerned about them surviving travel.
BUT I did read accounts of Catholic orphanages sometimes hiding Jewish children and passing them off as Catholic.
There was also a woman (I think it was a woman) who would smuggle children out of the ghettos to save them from the camps.
She kept a list of them all too in hopes of being able to reunite them with their families after the war.
There were definitely some brave SOBs who put their own lives on the line to try to save people they didn’t know from a horrible fate.
Highly recommend reading some first hand accounts from that time if you’ve never dug into it.
There’s a lot of suffering but also some amazing stories.
“Piliarska confirmed for the first time that four of the five children for whom she falsified records were not even orphans — they had parents with whom she spoke regularly.”.
