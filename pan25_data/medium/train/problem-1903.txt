Isreal will investigate, find who was behind it.
Find them hiding in some village or in west bank.
Send IDF to arrest them.
Locals and other terrorists will open fire at IDF, some fire exchange will happen, someone will die, and everyone will blame israel for instigating it, and completely forgot that the terrorists used bombs with nails in them to maximize civilian deaths.
Hamas or other group might send rockets at isreal for killing someone during the fire exchange, and another event will occur, and again everyone will blame israel for protecting itself by separating themselves from a group that only wants israel citizens to die.
The problem is, they are doing a red herring by reacting to this fact with "well, Israel hurt them beforehand".
It's not important.
It's not the point (and it's not exactly true but that's another thing).
Israel tries to reason with the Palestinians 5 times already, even giving them complete control over almost all of the West Bank excluding East Jerusalem that Israel annexed.
And they still refused, they don't care about that.
They care about killing Israelis - more specifically?
Jews.
Can't find where I read about PIJ.
I could be wrong about them.
I might have just read an article mentioning how Hamas hasn't claimed responsibility and PIJ have been silent, or something.
The point is that every time there's somewhat of peace - the Palestinians are terrorizing civilian Israelis.
