“We have to check every day the situation at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe.
If there is no radiation leaks?
The Russian army has turned this nuclear power plant de-facto into a military training ground.
They are constantly ‘playing’ with connecting and disconnecting the plant and nuclear reactors from the power grid.
This is a direct risk of a radiation disaster.
Who will care, for example, about the amount of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere if part of Europe or the Middle East, and possibly northern Africa, God forbid, are covered by a radiation cloud after an accident in Zaporizhzhia?
Last year we could not even imagine that kind of question, but this year Russia has posed dozens of such questions to the world,” Zelensky said.
Ukraine has about 9.7M hectares of forests with the Trans-Carpathian and Ivano-Frankivsk sections being the old growth and national monuments.
Let's hope Russia stays far away from these.
People tend to forget that war also has a huge environmental impact.
Also when people are dying we tend to forget about doing our best to save the enviornment.
