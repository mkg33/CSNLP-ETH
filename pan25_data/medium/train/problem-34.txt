They either sell it or burn it off .. must be painful as fuck watching all the money turn to smoke at the wellhead ..
I bet they have burnt up over $50 billion worth of natural gas this year.
ELI12 .. Once you stop a gas well you run the risk of the gas stops flowing and you have to find another pocket and start from scratch (think of it as inertia from a siphon) .. when you are in an incredibly cold place like northern Russia this can get expensive very quickly.
.. this goes the same for the oil .. stopping flows on oil pipelines in frozen weather causes ice and gel plug blockages .. the RuZZians no longer have Exxon and BP to fix their problems .. on top of this we are having a recession which means oil will go down in price anyway .. 2023 may be a very bad year for them.
Also the only reason those wells are flowing in the first place is because of US O&G service companies.
All of which have pulled out.
So, won't be able to drill too many more for a long time.
Not really no.
All the majors (biggest o/g firms) are either Western (Shell, Exxon Mobile, Total) or utilize Western tech (Armaco and other Middle East petro states, including formerly Russia).
