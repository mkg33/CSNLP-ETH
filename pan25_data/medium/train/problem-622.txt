It's the exact same now with COVID.
Hospitals won't report accurate numbers of infections and deaths fearing prosecution and being blamed for ineffectiveness.
And it will only escalate from there.
Why start now?
They havenâ€™t participated with the rest of the world in COVID data sharing.
And now half the people arriving on planes originating there are testing positive on landing?
The WHO has been complicit in the charade of the CCP and COVID.
So even if they shared their data it can be a magnitude off in either direction (well, most likely underrepresented).
So asking them to share it really won't do that much good.
It could be potentially useful to locating particularly large source of infections I guess?
They do have data but China has a strict policy of exaggerating their successes and underestimating their failures.
For instance while most know that primary cause of Great Chinese Famine (that has killed 15-50 million people) is that for some reason Chinese government has decided to kill all the sparrows the second reason was VAST overreporting of grain production.
So much so that they have started exporting some of their food while ordering farmers to move to other sectors.
It was lies on every level - farmer would say they made 2 tons rather than 1.8 tons, regional manager would see 2 tons and tune it up to 2.2 tons and it went up the chain.
And just like that instead of realizing these are deathly shortages that need to be addressed immediately they thought they have so much food that they might as well sell it.
