That’s not true, if substance here means goals, they absolutely have substance, that substance being that they desperately want the rich to be allowed to exploit the middle and lower classes into the dust for their own profit.
They want corporations to have rights over their employees and not be held accountable for poor treatment or working conditions.
They want to adjust civil rights to suit their taste (their taste of course being that minorities, women, and the poor will have none).
They want to be able to accept bribes from the oil and gas industry to block changes that would combat or slow climate change (just kidding, they already do this flagrantly).
They have plenty of substance and it’s easy to see because it revolves exclusively around their own interest to the detriment of everyone else.

I kid you not the official national GOP platform through 2024 is locked on "hail Trump".
Literally no other policy agenda whatsoever than whatever Trump feels in the moment.
Go to their site and prove it for yourself.
They document it themselves.
They're proud of the fact that they have neither agenda nor principles.
I don't see how this party lasts into the future.
They're not going to gain the vast majority of younger voters and old people... die.
The party is over and the Republican cum drunk will end soon enough.
Good giving riddance.
