Turkey accused the United States of complicity in the attack because America has long maintained a military partnership with a Kurdish-led militia in Syria.
Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu, during a visit to the site of the attack on Monday, dismissed condolence messages from the United States, saying this was like “the killer is among the first ones returning to the scene.”.

Do you mean it would lead you to believe the United States is directly involved in the attack?
The headline uses "accuse," which is Turkey's claim and they could be lying or wrong.
One shouldn't take the accusation as fact, but it is a fact that Turkey (or one of its representatives) is accusing the United States of complicity, even if Turkey's accusation is ridiculous.
