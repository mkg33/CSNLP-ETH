Currently, that position is held by Saudi Arabia, aided by the fact that Saudi Arabia controls 2 of the 3 holiest sites in Islam, Medina and Mecca, and also a huge economy.
Saudi Arabia has previously picked fights with Iran over this (alongside the Sunni/Shia divide and then the pro-US/anti-US sentiments) and there's a lot of friction between the UAE and Saudi Arabia even though they are aligned technically.
If you want a more recent US example, just look at the overturning of Roe v Wade earlier this year which threw women's rights to bodily autonomy and abortion rights into peril in red states.
While the US is miles ahead of Qatar, it is still concerning that there's still a significant percentage of the population who have yet to grok that half the population deserves equal rights to the other half and that religion shouldn't affect that.
"A wife is to submit graciously to the servant leadership of her husband, even as the church willingly submits to the headship of Christ."
