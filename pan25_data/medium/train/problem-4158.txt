That's not quite what it says.
It says, "Forty per cent of Russian conscripts whose deaths have been confirmed have died since 1 January (2023)."
So it is talking about conscripts and not all Russian soldiers, and it is talking about those deaths that can be confirmed by the BBC, which is almost certainly not all deaths.
It's still a pretty horrifying statement.
"Quote: "Forty per cent of Russian conscripts whose deaths have been confirmed have died since 1 January [2023 â€“ ed.].
".
The article actually says that 40% of conscript deaths occurred in 2023.
The other 60% died between September and December.
"The first reports of combat losses of the mobilised began to arrive at the beginning of October 2022; that is, less than two weeks after the start of mobilisation.
".
Nothing can be inferred in absolute terms, correct.
We'd need information regarding the population size as compared to the sample, i.e.
how many conscripts were sent in total since September?
Of those, how many died?
Also they were following a selection of 1,082 mobilized soldiers that the BBC had identified as killed, so its 40% of those soldiers that died after Jan 1st.
"Based on open sources, the publication established the names of 1,082 mobilised Russians who died in the war in Ukraine".
Considering that many conscripts were not even in Ukraine until well after September, this strikes me as somewhat similar to "40% of sick days are called in on Mondays and Fridays.
".
Even then, there are a plethora of other influencing factors.
Where were the conscripts sent?
What equipment was provided?
What was the ratio of professional soldiers to conscripts during their deaths?
The availability of commanding officers?
