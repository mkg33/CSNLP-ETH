You don't think China hasn't already stolen any and all IP that they can?
The fact of the matter is that the most important parts of the iPhone (and any smartphone) is the SoC and security chips, and no matter the data China can get on the schematics they can't actually make the chips.
They simply don't have the fabricating capabilities.
The point is that the ideal isn't how things work.
There is literally nothing we do that can be defined in general terms by your standards.
If the most valuable corporation to ever exist isn't capitalist then what is?
Do you get it now?
When people describe things they almost never mean that it is consistent in every way.
The problem for apple is that their phones are made there.
The CCP would have said if you don’t agree your phone is no longer allowed to be made here and then they’d steal IP.
I have not proof of this but can 100% see this happening (have happened).
It's why while the iPhone's are assembled in China, the actual chips are made in Taiwan by TSMC.
Chips that China has no way of replicating.
