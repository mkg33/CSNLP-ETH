Every proposal for “peace” thus far amounts to just giving Putin what he wants.
There is no mention of guarantees against future aggression, or of any kind of compensation to the Ukrainians.
The next few months of this war will be the most decisive yet, as russian conscripts now make their military force in the region larger than Ukraine's.
This peace deal lies on if Ukraine or Russia trust they will be able to fully win such a war.
If neither believe in an achievable victory, they'll come to the table.
Brazil wants to gain international goodwill by positioning itself as the mediator of such a peace if it occurs.
As a foubding member of BRICS, and the most pro US/Europe member of BRICS currently, Itamaraty is trying to position itself in such a way to booster future foreign policy objectives of Brazil, like renegotiating it's OECD entry application, Mercosur-EU free trade treaty, objectives in Africa and Latin America, and UNSC permanent seat objetctives.
Ukraine itself has backed Brazil's proposal at the UN, with Lula having 2 conversations with Zelensky in the past week, so this isn't a long shot.
Though I should add that the situation might change quickly depending on who and what is brought to the table and which demands are made.
