Clarification: You don’t need a permit to demonstrate in Sweden.
They can still go rally their people and burn the Koran if they want to.
Being denied a permit happens all the time and just means the police won’t help you out with proactive efforts like diverting traffic etc etc.
Police will only give permit if they can guarantee public order, and following recent events they don’t think they can for this demonstration.
That in itself can be seen as a failure, but they’re still free to demonstrate.
The police just won’t proactively spend resources and taxpayer money to facilitate it.
