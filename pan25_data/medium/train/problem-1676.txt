I wonder though.
He did try to kill him with Novichok.
After that Navalny and Bellingcat exposed the plot and I think he made that YouTube video before return.
So if he was killed right upon re entry or second attempt, this could have triggered a revolt, who knows.
Him being alive keeps opposition nice and hopeful (i.e.
yes very much martyr situation just more nuanced I think because first attempt failed).
Just theorizing.
And it revolutionized his entire civilization to boot.
It’s just courage.
Life is meaningless, but this guy makes it mean a lot.
Edit: this guy being Navalny, not me pointing my thumbs at myself.
I don’t know how they would honestly.
They live in nothing but propaganda, and those of the population that aren’t dumb enough to be fooled are also poor as hell and Wagner + Russian military have 0 issue killing their own.
Letting then walk free is a smart move as it silences anyone saying you are punishing dissidents, they even faked some stuff to prosecute him in court to legitimize his sentencing.
I really dislike the dude for a number of reasons but i pity him and think that the Russian sentencing of him is obviouly a political ploy to hamper his life and anyone supporting him.
I bet you think Socrates was a jerk too, don’t you?
To paraphrase him, “if you will not take any more questions from me, I have some questions about what happens after death, and some questions for God.”.
Did a lot of good for Socrates.
You know he never wrote a single book and you and I both know his whole life story?
Wow!
