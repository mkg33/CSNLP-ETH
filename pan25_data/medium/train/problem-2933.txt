In hindsight, appeasement was terrible, led to the annexation of Czechoslovakia entirely which made the Nazis stronger (capturing hundred of tanks, artillery, etc), and it only encouraged Hitler to keep pushing France and Britain's buttons, but at the time appeasement was rather popular in Britain and France where the wounds of WWI were still quite fresh and ever-present.
Looking around and seeing a bunch of scarred and maimed veterans, or thinking of all the brothers, fathers, uncles, friends, etc who died in the last war, I think it's kinda understandable why people in those countries weren't so keen on rushing into another big war, especially one over some people (ethnic Germans in this case) who happened to fall on the wrong side of a border after some hastily-drawn borders in 1919 (or so the thinking would go).
At least it did buy the Allies some valuable time to re-arm.
I'd like to call him Captain Obvious.... but he's right.
This needs to be stated, over and over again.
Russia will not win this war or any part of Ukraine.
