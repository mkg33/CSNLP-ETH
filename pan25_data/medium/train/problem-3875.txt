Sitting in my cozy house now drinking my hot morning coffee while surfing the internet.
Crazy how lucky I am just for being born in a different country.
I respect the people of Ukraine so much for their spirit, and backing their country in this difficult times.
Electricity just went back.
The Internet was available during all that time.
And I had a great cup of coffee that morning.
We are lucky that we have amazing people in the ZSU(our army).
Also the United States and Europe help to keep us going.
We are just not so lucky with mindless neighbors.
Crazy how lucky I am just to be born in Ukraine and not in Russia.
I had that chance and my parents moved to Ukraine just before I was born.
Your people are viewed as heroes who are fighting for your country by much of the world.
Much better than being viewed as mindless butchers who are attacking another country for no good reason.
I take it you haven't seen the video with the older age Russian soldier outside a nondescript Ukrainian warehouse, bawling his eyes out, having found a human slaughterhouse where the Ukrainian Jew Nazis were undressing the local White kids on the first floor, and butchering them on the second floor?
I thought not.
Body parts, adrenochrome, and sex trafficking.
That's all the locals are good for, in these Satanists' eyes.
Yeah, Ukraine need weapons.
Sadly our new government didn't invest into our own military developments aver 2019 president elections.
Now we need that help otherwise Ukraine won't exist.
People adjusted.
Most of the small businesses have generators.
Households that can afford it have batteries and stable internet connection(GPON).
Wake the hell up and get your news outside the controlled fake media, cause it's clear reading all these posts, 99% of you have no clue what's really going on.
It'll make you cry when you do.
