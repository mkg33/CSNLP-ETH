Afghanistan and Ireland were promoted to the exclusive club of Full Members of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2017.
This level of membership allows for automatic qualification for certain global tournaments (this particular series was part of once such tournament) and for better access to financial income from the ICC.
As a requirement of Full Membership, each country must have a 'pathway' for women players.
At the time, Afghanistan had some sort of pathway, even if it were just on paper or in its infancy.
Under the current regime, even pretending to have that sort of program would be difficult.
The controversy now arises from the ICC being reluctant to reassess Afghanistan's membership level in light of them not being able to meet the requirements of Full Membership.
Nope even American taxpayers money pays for deaths of collateral killings all over the Middle East lol.
We all play a part even if itâ€™s inadvertent and unintentional .
Yup and our entire country and news cycle stopped for a month it was insane here in NZ.
It's all they'd talk about and only positive things.
Crazy to me.
Women's Rugby has had a great burst of growth over the last few years.
The recent World Cup in New Zealand broke all sorts of viewership and ticket sales records.
