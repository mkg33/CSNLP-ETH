Right wing platform’s spread misinformation on any and all topics they can because the people that make up their main base tend to be less educated, poorer, and crazy Christian nuts..the right wing politicians do and say whatever even if they don’t believe what they’re saying.
They get votes from their base by stoking the illogical fears and fanning the flames of conspiracy because it works on their base.
Their base is at its core, fueled by the ignorant belief that they themselves are victims of a liberal agenda that targets these right wing nuts and take away their jobs, want to indoctrinate kids into being gay or trans, to turn them into atheists, take their tax money to give to lazy liberal welfare moms and give thousands in free food stamps, and on and on.
