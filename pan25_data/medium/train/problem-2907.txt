It's schrodinger's brexit.
It at any given time you can point at something and say "This is why people voted brexit" or "This isn't why people voted Brexit" and be both right and wrong.
Brexit was clusterfuck of made up reasons that don't reflect reality and if something goes wrong people who voted for brexit just shift narrative to "This isn't why we voted brexit, here is other unicorn reason why and if that goes to shit we will shift narrative again".
Dunno mate, I'm in my 30s and as much as I hate the tories they are starting to look like the only viable party to vote for.
£538 in 2010 is the equivalent of £722.18 in April 2022 (when the ASHE report that Dodds references was compiled).
So men are also £39.18 worse off per week than in 2010.
Or, in annual terms, men are £2037.36 worse off than in 2010.
Majority of working age men and women didn't vote for it.
The only bracket in which tories are winning in any way are over 55s.
So it's boomers voting for leopards to eat their kids and grandkids faces.
I would rather scoup out my eyes with a rusty spoon than vote for any of the nationalist-tinted parties.
