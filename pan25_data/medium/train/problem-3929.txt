This is really a terrific point.
But I struggle with it for a few reasons.
First, the injuries inflicted by Trump’s enablers through him and his ilk are cumulative, progressively eroding trust, decency, global standing, safety.
Second, climate change is a legitimate existential challenge.
He arose as we ran out of collective runway and actively worked against addressing the problem.
Third, the discovery that so many folks really like him is appalling, depressing, and even disorienting.
But it wasn’t nameless strangers.
It was people we loved and respected.
People with whom we thought we shared values or from whom we derived our identity.
That sort of psychic blow isn’t something you just shrug off as banal political difference.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
