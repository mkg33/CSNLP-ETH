The guy literally strives for anonymity whilst shining a spotlight on cultural or contentious subjects.
You're not criticizing art.
You're whining about Banksy for no stated reason whatsoever.
That's not called art criticism.
It's called being on the rag.
No.
Ukraine doesn‚Äôt need the publicity of some attention seeking hack who‚Äôs managed to dupe a generation into thinking his self absorbed graffiti is ‚Äúdeep‚Äù.
Especially not after so many months of conflict.
Well you at least recognize your problem.
That's the first step on the road to recovery.
And I'm not wasting my time--this is absolutely deliciously fun for me.
And if you don‚Äôt think I enjoy the salt, why else do you think I‚Äôm doing this?
I was the one who started this.
You‚Äôre reading this and getting worked up because of me ‚ù§Ô∏è.
The reaction you're getting has nothing to do with Banksy's fans.
It's the fact that you tilt easier than one of those clown punching bags.

Criticize Banksy to all the simps on reddit and watch the salt roll in salt üßÇ.
Who fucking cares man.
No one is simping Banksy.
They're just making fun of you because you're acting absurd.
Fuck Banksy.
Who cares.
The fact that you are acting this way about anyone makes you worthy of fucking with and mocking.
Honestly, I couldn't care less.
Just find it funny that these comments could have been an opportunity to discuss Ukraine and yet people are hung up on their unconfirmed opinions of some artist's personality.
Any Internet artist is technically anonymous too, signing their works with their online handle only: so does it mean they can never be egoistical or narcissistic simply because everything they make benefits their online persona instead of their irl self?
