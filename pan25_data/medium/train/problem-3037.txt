Using combat simulation models from Russia's existing performance, Ukraine will be at Crimea's border by July and the Liberation of Mariupol will begin by August.
This is when reality will hit for Putin and is the most likely circumstance where he would use tactical nuclear weapons.. but if he does that, he will end the unspoken agreement made at Yalta 78 years ago.

While an Abrams can storm through the snow and mud, fuel trucks can’t.
