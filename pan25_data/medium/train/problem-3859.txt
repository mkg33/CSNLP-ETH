Negative Karma is from trolls who want to silence your positive attitude on Reddit to prevent your voice from being measured and worthy of being heard.
Here is an example of my Karma.
I despise War period.
If you read this and wish for me to remove 13 negative Karmas please give me at least 13 positive Karmas.
I assume most Redditors despise war .
I would appreciate your kindness if you are against war and support this idea with giving me a positive Karma.
This in all honesty should give me unlimited Karma.
Well at least a million.
Wouldn’t that be awesome if this could help end this horrible war.
Please show your support with a positive Karma for me as an example we are all against wars.
Show the world a lot of positive Karmas to show we are all against war forever.
Not just this war but all wars.
Show the world a million Karmas.
I hope the Ukraine war could end immediately and the children are returned home…..Please have a positive day….
Meanwhile there's really no benefit to the people for this happening, just to the power the politicians have over them.
