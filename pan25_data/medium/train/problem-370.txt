There’s no winning a mission like that, the Haitians will hate you, the American right wing will hate you for “wasting money on them” and the American left wing will hate you/blame you for acting like a colonial power.
As a bonus there’s no hope of a lasting fix.
Setting aside my own personal feelings on the subject, what on earth does either the US, Canada, or Mexico stand to gain by getting involved?
You would need to basically take over the entire country and rebuild every institution from the ground up, as well as fix a culture in which corruption is accepted as a regular fixture in daily life.
You would need billions of dollars and massive oversight to make sure money was spent properly, and the slightest infraction from one of your troops/police would immediately cause protests and cries of colonialism/imperialism.
And let’s be clear, even if all that happened, there’s no guarantee it would even work.
Yeah if I were a policy maker I'd be worried that a wrong step by the US military could lead to a bunch of dead Haitians, and that would not go over well with the left side of US politics.
I don't really believe the US military trains to fight urban gang warfare either, though I could be wrong.
The USMCA nations have practically nothing to gain and almost everything to lose by getting involved in the shit-show in Haiti.
