Some people genuinely believe that occupying whatever is the equivalent of the throne will make people obey them.
In the article in Danish Broadcasting Service's Homepage they wrote that they apparently had access to large sums of money.
I find that scary - in the 90s we were all making fun of the Neonazis in Denmark (they were so uncool and stupid it's beyond belief - one of their biggest publicity stunts was to create a swastika shaped barbecue grill).
But these recent Nazis seem to be able to actually organise and perform bigger plans.
I first read it as the Nazis doing the raiding, and was very confused and concerned about how I had missed some major developments.
BBC News deemed this important enough to have its app show a notification, but Tagesschau (German public broadcaster news) didn't.
Sure, but my point was that it didn't even meet Tagesschau's threshold for having their app display a breaking news notification.
It's a matter of how Reichsb√ºrger pose a risk in terms of occasional violent acts, which is of course still a serious concern, but it's not an actual threat to the democratic order.
Or put differently, imagine you had been planning to overthrow the government, already saw yourself as the future Reichsminister for Matters of Utmost Import, and the media doesn't even consider your attempted coup to have been important enough to make users' phones go "bing".
