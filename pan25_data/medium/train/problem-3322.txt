I think a lot of people need to hear that.
People on Reddit have gotten so accustomed to dismissing the russians and mocking them as incompetent.
To be fair, they deserve a lot of that.
But people have become complacent on here and itâ€™s important that we continue to take the threat seriously.
Just the sheer numbers Russia can throw at Ukraine should make any country sharing a border with them nervous.
Already losing 130k soldiers and considerable amounts of armor and material, which would mean certain defeat for any other country except maybe China or NATO countries, but Russia just keeps coming.
For western countries however, this war has been an eye-opener that "we" can actually take them if it ever gets that far.
But I've said it before, if we ever come to blows with Russia, many will die, including a lot of civilians in the combat zones.
Even a weak enemy is capable of doing a lot of damage.
I do think it needs to be pointed out that this also means certain defeat for Russia here, and that this was in some respects determined on the day they invaded - they do not now and have never had the necessary numbers to conquer Ukraine.
It's just that their massive size is letting them drag out the torment.
