>The MAK report found the "immediate cause" of the accident was the failure of the crew to make a timely decision to proceed to an alternate airport despite being warned multiple times of the poor weather conditions at Smolensk.
[10] Another immediate cause was the descent below minimums without visual contact with the ground as well as ignoring numerous TAWS warnings.
[10] This led to controlled flight into terrain.

is Russia capable of doing something like this?
why yes, of course.
they've shot down planes and they'll do it again.
But that doesn't mean that every air disaster that they benefit from was actually done by them.
i remembered reading at the time and concluding that it was a combination of the weather conditions and pilot error.
important to focus on what bad Russia \actually\ has done, and not cry wolf for what they didn't do...
If I remember correctly it was an old senior airforce officer pressuring them (suspected to be drunk).
Basically telling them it's safe and easy to land in those conditions, you know the.. "when I was a lad we would land planes blindfolded with no engines" type.
Kaczynski commanded the pilot to land in bad conditions when he shouldn't have and got a bunch of people killed because of his idiocy.
This is PiS smuggling their politically expedient conspiracy theory into what should be an obvious condemnation of actual stuff that Russia is completely responsible for.
Unfortunately, the right-wing PiS is engaging in nationalist propaganda.
