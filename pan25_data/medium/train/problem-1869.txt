And then run their next elections on the evil Dems wanting to spend your hard earned money blah blah, after Senate doesn't pass it.
My most cynical guess is they're going to drag this particular issue out until it's time to raise the debt ceiling.
Then the Dems get a choice: keep the country and the global economy functioning, or keep the last vestiges of the social safety net alive so some people can make it through.
Either way they get villainized.
Even more cynical: that all happens, Republicans run on "those awful Dems took away your social security.
".
In general, be courteous to others.
