That’s hilarious I really wonder if the writers of Idiocracy had in mind like an alternate timeline where the philanthropic celebrities are the ones who take the helm.
Not saying it would be any better off!
I’d sure as hell watch Idiocracy 2 Electric Boogaloo with T Swift though haha even the thought is hilarious.

Ticketmaster is only part of the problem.
The main problem is the secondary market and how so many tickets seem to get there before official sales happen, and then by scalpers which is no longer the typical guy on the street corner with "extra tickets" but an ever growing business with stub hub and others.
You don't see tickets being resold for airline flights and other things like that take the secondary market out of the equation.
Your name must be on the ticket and if you can't go you get a refund or eat the cost, same as most other things.
