Well all of the apps servers are only in China, they will not allow any server to be placed in a different country.
This app has billions of users all over the world but the only government that can get involved is China's.
So that means they have access to a shit ton of data that they can use to track people around the world.
The app has so many niche fandoms that they could sort out who they will or will not approve of or condone of.
If there government can control & monitor its own citizens then they can certainly use tictok to monitor the outside world.
If China did ever decide to attack us they can use the app to find the most vulnerable targets.
Kids.
LGBTQIA+ folks.
And anyone of different ethnicity that they have chosen as an enemy.
Also they can find the real Nazi's & the alt-right lunatics who use the app to spread hate & disinformation.
Tictok has complete access to every bit of data on a users device.
And China has complete access to the company.
They took over AliBaba, disappeared the CEO multiple times and then made it a government controlled business.
Coincidentally right as the shopping app Temu was gaining steam.
How many people around the world use Shein as well?
These companies are not "private entities" bc the government can & will step in anytime they damn well want too.
Todays youth uses TikTok as a news source and people take advantage of ignorance and can make some human beings believe everything they say.
Cancel the app the world would be better off.
I’m too old to use TikTok.
My life has gotten better since I shunned all social media.
I use Twitter to talk shit about sports and Snapchat to talk to like 2 people I want to keep in touch with.
Reddit doesn’t count.
