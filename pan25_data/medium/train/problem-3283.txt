I don’t get how he got any women votes from that and never will.
Remember when women who voted for him said “I’d let him do that to me” Or say “it was just locker room talk.
Guys say that all the time” Ugh.
So disgusting.
As a woman, I can't comprehend how any woman could vote for such a vulgar and vile man.
Our daughter and many of her fellow female students in college are sickened by Trump.
I love that there were 1.5 million women who attended the Women's March in D.C. protesting this repugnant slob the day after his inauguration.
And there were a total of 3.5 million across the country.
I have no respect, nor do I want anything to do with anyone who still supports Trump.
