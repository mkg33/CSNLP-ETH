Trump has been an unmitigated disaster and danger TO THE WORLD.
His people knew he was a moron.
They shielded him.
They knew he was a terrible human being with violent instincts.
They defended him.
They knew he was an unethical, unqualified buffoon.
They protected him.
They knew he was a threat to national security and a criminal.
They didn't care.
Donald Trump (Tommy Tuberville, Herschel Walker, Marge Green, Lauren Boebert, Andy Gosar, Madison Cawthorne, Louis Gohmert) - is the best the Republicans have to offer... and somehow they have gotten away with putting idiots and morons in places where they can harm us all.
It's insane that they have the power and control they do.
