At the time that agreement on the Palestinian side was led by Yasser Arafat, who was part of Fatah.
Since that agreement, most Palestinians do not support Fatah and definitely not Mahmood Abbas since he took over.
As much as I wold like to think that Hamas can't speak for the Palestinian people, in reality they do, they were democratically elected by the Palestinian people and still have wide support from them.
The Palestinian government goes back and forth on recognition, clearly does not stop the Oslo accords given the way the WB looks right now, Hamas very specifically does not recognize Israel and at points has called for the eradication of not only Israelis but Jews world wide.
Jews lived in East Jerusalem for centuries, then Jordan attacked Israel in 48 and took over it, ethnically cleansed the Jews, stole their homes, and put Palestinians in them instead.
In 67 Israel took it back, but didn't kick out the Palestinians, they just had to pay rent.
How does this relate to the "" proposal, which I thought was put forth by the Saudi leadership in June 2022?
Is this is change in Saudi Arabia's stance?
Or was that never really Saudi Arabia's formal stance?
Thanks for any clarifications.
