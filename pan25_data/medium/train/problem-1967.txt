Like Tsar Nicholas, Putin himself personally doesn't care if a person is Gay, Jewish, or whatever.
He's only concerned about staying in and expanding his power.
He knows that large portions of his population dove deeply back into Orthodox Christianity or Islam after the Soviets and their efforts to errm... "discourage" organized religion went away, and he also knows that the quality of Russian education, and the content therein, is lower and has less emphasis on tolerance and coexistence than that of the Soviets.
So, just like Tsar Nicholas, Putin is using the ignorance and bigotry of post Soviet Russia to his benefit and to shore up support and power by simply parroting the bigotry of the poorly educated and religiously indoctrinated masses against disempowered groups that don't pose a threat to him any way.
Antisemitism is just Europe’s version/ancestor of American racism.
Difference is, Jews have been extirpated from most of Europe so now they’re kinda randomly turning on migrants, the EU, and other shit.
