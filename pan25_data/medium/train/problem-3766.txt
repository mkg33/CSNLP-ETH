This is, unfortunately, the nature of every war, Russia or NATO.
They claim they are bombing military targets, but in reality in 1999, a hospital 10 minutes from my house was bombed by NATO.
A farmers market was bombed in the middle of the busiest day.
A civilian train.
Numerous other cases.
Most of these made it seldomly, if at all, to mainstream media.
And this all in a conflict where the bombed side had a fraction of defensive abilities that Ukrainian today has, while the offensive weapons used were supposedly much higher precision.
Ukraine's air defenses are shooting down most of Russia's missiles lately, so Russia won't be able to hit most of the targets it wants to hit.
It's running out of missiles too.
those motherfuckers are so incompetent that we have to invent new verb tenses to describe what they say their plan is.
Read as: intentionally targeting civilian leadership, likely both at a national level, as well as just straight up murdering local mayors or other similar officials.
