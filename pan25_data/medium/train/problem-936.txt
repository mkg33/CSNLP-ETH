They really can't do anything to servers not located in the UK and blocking stuff on the internet is like putting your hand over your eyes and pretending that the world stopped existing.
Alliances/co-operation with other countries can result in take down of servers in other countries.
Also other Western countries have similar rules and wouldnt allow this content to be hosted either excluding possibly the U.S.
And wheedling down the amount of people that can access it makes it easier to track and monitor these people.
We can do a pretty good job at making sure 95% of people cant access this stuff and those that do are being monitored.
Instead of millions of kids thinking its cool/funny to look at this stuff now the government can focus its resources on a hundred or so actual threats.
Say what you want but access to certain things on the web are definitely hard and heavily monitored.
If you feel so confident go ahead and search for certain porn or guides like the ones mentioned.
You will be on a list being monitored.
