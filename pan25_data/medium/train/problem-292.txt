The court ruled it because the constitution was set to follow a precise and scientific physical evidence in a very 20th century Scientific Fashion where all sciences were more akin to the physical and engineering sciences rather than modern biology.
A lot of biology at the time was explained and described and even drawn as a mechanical work.

Because transgenderism doesn't correlate with genitalia; You can identify as any gender with any set of genitalia, and you can identify as any gender no matter your sex (male or female).

When you see a female, you know their sex.
So it makes sense to infer their gender and call them a woman; even if the female identifies as a man.
But you shouldn't do that.
Their gender is whatever they identify as.
Remember that sex isn't the same as gender though, so you can just refer to their sex without disrespecting their gender identity.
It makes things easier, since we can tell your sex, but would have to see your genitals to know your gender.
And we really don't want to hear or see what your genitals are.
