This asshole took a $7 deduction for Jr’s Boy Scout application, despite the fact that: it’s not deductible and he didn’t even pay it, he stole the money from a charity to pay it and claimed it as his deduction.
This guy also is known to take the wildest, most brazenly fraudulent deductions (see his IRS case in the 80’s, which he lost and then continued with the same scheme), or the largest inheritance fraud in history which the NYT did an expose on, where he managed to turn his inheritance into fake deductions.
I too don’t keep track of my $2k and $3k deductions, but it’s not at all believable that Trump donated $1.6m over 4 years and didn’t deduct every single penny and then some.
Knowing Trump, after fleecing tax payers for secret service stays, he probably deducted some bullshit cost he paid himself for going.
