I realize we are all hate getting a citation in the mail, but if the goal is road safety, this is proven to work better than police pulling you over.
Here's the issue.

“…technology could be used to check for expired licenses and registrations — common infractions that disproportionately ensnare the poor and people of color.”.

Virtually no overlap.
