If we get to the point where nuclear states are attacking each other to the extent of destroying dams and having entire cities swept away in the aftermath, then the nukes are flying and you can forget "total war".
It's over in a day and everyone loses.

Commodore Arkhipov was the deciding vote to "retaliate" against allegedly launched Nuclear Missles.
For all intents and purposes, he believed that nukes were being launched, and rather than retaliating, he accepted the notion and never fired his own nukes.
I hope we never put this theory to the test, but I can only hope that if war breaks and total war re-enters the battlefield, those who press the button will not follow the orders of those who command it, for no matter the risk, the cost of launching/retaliating is that of humanity's future.

And it would enhance Japan’s conventional deterrent as China undertakes a sweeping military modernization and North Korea barrels ahead with its nuclear program.
