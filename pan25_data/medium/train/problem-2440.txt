This may seem like common knowledge to most people but I never knew this.
Insurance companies have an increasing net profit every year.
I haven't gotten into an accident for years but noticed that my house insurance spiked drastically last year.
Confused I called up my broker and he explained that our City experienced record number of house insurance claims last year.
As to offset their deficit they increased the premiums for everyone not just for those who needed to file a claim.
The rest of us are essentially paying for people's claims and MORE because c'mon the big wigs at these insurance companies want a new Ferrari this year.
Insurance is still to this day the most successful fraudulent business there has ever been.
I don't understand how it's hard to catch the fraudsters.
They didn't run off into the mountains with a big sack with a dollar sign on it.
They were paid by funds transfer to an account.
That account is owned by somebody.
Find out who.
If _that_ account is owned by a faked identity, then the money was transferred somewhere else.
Someone eventually collected it, or has it.
