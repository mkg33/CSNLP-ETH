Germany has ended its dependence on Russian energy.
Since August 11th, no coal has been imported.
Natural gas imports have been reduced from 55% at the beginning of 2022 to zero.
Oil imports dropped from 40% to under 20%, and will be phased out by the end of this year.
⚡️ General Staff: It was confirmed that the Russians had suffered a firefight on 29 December.
Thus, in the area of the settlement of Fedorivka, Kakhovska District, Kherson region, about 200 Russian soldiers were eliminated, and information on the wounded is being clarified.
In addition, the Russians suffered 115 soldiers wounded near Polohy and Velyka Bilozerka of the Zaporizhzhia region, 5 pieces of Russian military equipment of various types, an anti-aircraft missile system and an ammunition depot were destroyed.
The key question of 2023 is how many Russians need to die before a critical mass of them understand what other Europeans have concluded before them: that imperial illusions are not worth it.
Getting these new LNG terminals and pipelines built so fast has been a Manhattan Project level effort for Germany, and they're not getting much credit for it in international media.
The last working day of 2022 ends on the Natural Gas market in Europe (EU) in an excellent way for Europe.
With only 76 EUR/MWh the price is almost at the lowest point of the whole year.
Only few days in February it was lower.
Very good news.
Hope it continues.
Not just for Germany, but all of Europe.
We must ween ourselves off the terrorist scum that have now sunk to ISIS-level depravity.
