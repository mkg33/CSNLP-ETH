I'm glad that's their method, because they suck at using neurotoxin.
They killed innocent people in the UK instead of the target, who survived.
Less chance of collateral damage with a falling body, but not a zero chance.
A bunch of amateurs if you ask me.
If I were an assassin, my methods of executions would be hilarious.
I'd find ways to drop pianos on people's heads, make them slip on banana peels, paint car tunnel openings on brick walls, replace their parachute with pots and pans, etc.
I'd be the Bugs Bunny of hitmen.
People watch too much tv.
It's very easy to cover your tracks in real life.
A murder from my grandmother's block in Philly went unsolved for 15 years because the guy wore a bald cap.
He was on recording breaking in, touching everything, and leaving with blood on him.
Only reason he was caught was he pawned a piece of jewelry years later that was a limited run tiffany that was in the report.
Cops even arrested this guy in connection to it a few days after it happenedbut let him go in under 30 minutes without printing him because he wasn't bald.
Especially if you have no personal connection with a victim.
Truly random violence makes it almost impossible to find the perpetrator unless they are genuinely stupid.
