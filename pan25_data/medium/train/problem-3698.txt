Serious question about military tactics: why do they spread out their attacks like that?
like, why not 1000 at once?
is this an issue of logistics, or do they hope with every barrage that this will be enough already?
or are they simply inept?
Unprofessional opinion is its more about spreading terror, if they thought they had the ability to send a crippling blow, they'd do it.
Since they don't keeping people living in fear is the next best thing.
They also have to keep feeding the propaganda machine inside of Russia.
Every launch is a opportunity to spread lies about the glorious motherland.
The old Soviet era stuff likewise needs to be taken out of storage and repaired/refurbished before being sent to a launch site.
Logistics; the days of the Soviet Union cranking out hundreds of tanks a day is long gone.
It takes a long time to build enough of their newer cruise missiles for another concentrated wave.
Each wave of attacks is more like the yearly production of these missiles.
Sure there are some new-builts mixed in there, but they are mostly still from stocks of them.
Russia is burning way more missiles than they are producing, so that’s still “running out”.
They have run out of the majority of their stock of things like Iskander where they are at 1/6 their pre-war stocks, and are at levels of sea and air launched cruse missiles that would make NATO forces quite nervous.
Theres one thing that Ukraine has that almost no UN state possess, and that's battle hardened/ tested soldiers a very valuable asset that might be a scary prospect to some and explain why they get and don't get different types of support.
But that’s still hundreds if not low thousands remaining, and not even counting the 6000+ S300’s that can also be used in a ground attack mode.
What we’re seeing is Russia being willing to deplete it’s stockpiles far further than we though they would.
This cripples their ability to project force or have credible deterrence in the future.
