The MAGAites crow about voter fraud are like the people who live is towns of 7000 and the 10-15 people who are family, friends and co-workers they socialize with all vote for red, and they don't see the world outside, the hundreds of millions of other Americans.
In their tiny minds, Jim-Bob and Helen at work are the voting base of America, and they voted red so how could they have lost??
?
You have those votes already.
You need to pull in the moderates to win.
Campaigning on nothing at all really and just saying "libs bad" isn't going to sway those people.
The fact that they keep referring to themselves as a "product" and a "brand" makes it pretty clear that they still don't get it.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
What they don't seem to get is that pandering to an ever shrinking MAGA isn't gonna get them anywhere.
And crying about voter fraud that has never had any evidence reach a court much less win a case isn't going to sway those people either.
Must have been cheating because a Diaper wearing Bunker Boy egged them on with a schtick of "rigged" he's been doing his whole life well before he got into politics because his fragile ego.
