This is actually insane.
I was a former defense contractor, writing software for one of the big names.
Anybody that knows programming, knows that 90% of what you do is integrate with third parties/plug-ins.
Like if you’re running a Java Web server, you use spring boot.
If it’s angular/node, you can use random libraries like font/web packs.
And this was for literally every third party module our code used.
For something like this to happen, there has to be a major, major screw up somewhere.
Because I know for a fact this application was likely security vetted the same way.
Which means whoever made this software did it in the way to slip through all those security checks.
Which makes you wonder what they didn’t find yet in other apps since that security vetting process obviously didn’t work.
A whole lot of US doctrine is conceptual, with very little set in stone.
Same with most of NATO for that matter.
And I'm not sure what use deployment patterns would have tbh.
We're not at war right now and the information has no current value.
Hell, doesn't help that with the way the military is(isn't) organized it wouldn't make any difference in the first place.
