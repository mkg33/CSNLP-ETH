The court also said that since the program in question “made claims about the legal and social issues of the anti-discrimination law based on the basic position of a specific religion that disapproves of homosexuality on a religious channel,” the comments also “came under the protection of freedom of religion.”.
The bench ruled that when the state regulates broadcast material for violating "the public interest," such as fairness or objectivity, rather than for violating an individual's specific right, it must do so based on even stricter considerations.
It added that the best way to achieve broadcasting fairness was "autonomous regulations" through criticism and push-back from viewers and civil society rather than state intervention.

Gagging and repressing someone is what countries like Iran, N Korea, Russia and China do.
Personally I enjoy knowing how people truly feel on a subject, Truth is a good thing.
