"One potential hurdle for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination acceptance is the risk of ADE, which may increase the severity of COVID-19.
Considering earlier reports of the effect of ADE on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, the hypothesis that ADE may occur with SARS-CoV-2 infection has existed since the outbreak of COVID-19 \[29,30,31,32\].
To date, numerous in vivo and in vitro experiments have been conducted to explore the occurrence of ADE in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
However, only one in vitro study has preliminarily demonstrated the possibility of ADE in SARS-CoV-2 infections \[9\].
Moreover, there is no evidence that ADE occurs in the SARS-CoV-2-infected population.
Thus, we cannot definitively determine whether ADE occurs in the reinfected population at present.
More population studies of SARS-CoV-2 must be conducted to clarify the role of ADE.

It is unfortunate in the case of a pandemic as we let our guards down, but we must adapt and life must go on.
Fear causes fatigue and people get desensitized to it after years of being drained by it, even under grave and potentially life threatening circumstances.
