Fear propaganda vs hope propaganda.
Who's going to give the speech talking about how many sick days the conductor of the train that derailed in Ohio got this year?
Or talk about how the federal government pumped tens of millions of dollars of COVID money into the police department that murdered Tyre Nichols?
Does anyone want to talk about how families of grandparents and grandchildren are still being separated on the southern border?
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
