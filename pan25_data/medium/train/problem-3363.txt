I know you're joking but I am so sick and tired of people spreading shit like this.
The frogs and gay-turning-pills are separate projects by The Agenda.
We drugged the US's major waterways to turn all frogs gay in order to destabilize the country's ecosystem, to serve as a distraction from our real aim; we developed the thing we secretly add to vaccines that turns people gay in order to grow our race, since us gays are parasitic lifeforms that can't reproduce on our own.

"Toilet" is itself a euphemism.
Those concerned with the purity of our language's precious bodily fluids must instead refer to the "defecal" (by analogy with "urinal" which is both literal and accepted).
There's also the fact that the local areas that host things like the Olympics or the World Cup are typically screwed over while these events are going on and for several years afterwards because they suddenly have massive stadiums and other facilities they may or may not be able to use yet still have to maintain.
Not to mention all the environmental damage that happens as a result of all this.
