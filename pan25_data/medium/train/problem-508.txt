and he's talking about a Balloon, can you believe it, "Sir, we have an Emergency," I said what is it General, "it's a Balloon, Sir, sent over from China," a Balloon.
so China, they're sending things, and they're not very good things but we have bigger things and those bigger things are going to make sure that we don't have any problems.
we have Air Force Jets and Beautiful Helicopters, and they're sending Balloons, give me a break.
you know all we would have to do, and I did it on The Apprentice, we already had Top Ratings, we were the Highest Rated Show in Television History just so you understand, and then I brought in the Trump Helicopter, very famous, very very good in terms of Helicopters, and then we went even bigger, our Ratings were over 100%, I had people calling me all the time, begging, "please, Sir, can we be on your show?"
I said we'll see what happens.
