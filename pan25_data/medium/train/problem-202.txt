Sounds to me like the parents had a ww2 rifle in the house and had the boy lie about finding it.
Why would a 14 year bother cleaning a rifle or know how to clean it without prior knowledge of rifles etc?
Hopefully the girl doesnâ€™t have any permanent issues from the accident.
Plenty of 14 year olds know how to clean a rifle.
It's an important part of responsible gun ownership.
Poland allows ownership of firearms with a permit, usually for sport shooting or hunting.
You have to be 18 or 21 to own a gun but parents might start teaching you how to safely use and care for one well before that age.
That said, making sure a rifle isn't loaded before you start cleaning it is also an important part of responsible gun ownership and the number of gun-cleaning related shootings shows how often people ignore that step.
Also, 14 year olds do stupid things, especially with firearms restoration videos being a relatively recent trend, whether they're real or not.
I can definitely see a 14 year old finding an old gun in the woods and taking it home to clean up, if he knows how to clean a rifle or not.
Kids are dumb.
And by a 14 year old?
The chances are basically 0.
For that gun to be fired it was restored by someone, and was likely well taken care of the last few decades.
ya I'm just doubtful a 80 year old rifle left to the elements could reasonably be restored at all, let alone by a 14 year old.
They almost certainly owned this thing; but the rest of your comment I agree with.
In my experience, a gun that sat outside in the woods for 80 years would be nearly unrestorable.
Even many guns that were stored indoors covered in grease for 80 years are unusable junk.
