Don’t think the Belarusians are all innocent.
I’ve seen plenty of them modelling online as “Ukrainians” in order to get sympathy, when for last bunch of years those models were all happy to tag themselves as Belarusians.
Poland and the Baltics have no chill when it comes to fucking over the Russians and that's a good thing, that part of Europe has been constantly fucked by the Russians across the centuries.
I think housing a standing army during a genocidal campaign is enough to indict the Belorussian as collaborators.
As to the doping who cares they tend to do what Russia does and are probably just as bad as cheaters.
This needs to happen.
russian athletes have no place in an event organized by Western organizations and hosted in "the land of homosexuals and heathens".
They can't play nice, so they shouldn't get to play at all.
Sure, but I never said it was exclusively owned by the west.
However, last I checked it's headquartered in Switzerland, was founded by a Frenchman and a Greek and is currently run by a German.
