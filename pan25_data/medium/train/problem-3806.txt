Maybe you could identify $160m a year Tennessee is wasting on some nonsense to cut costs and carve out another balanced alternative.
I understand they're mismanaging power generation a ridiculous amount.
Maybe look there.
That's the same governor .
And what have Tennessee legislators' done in the name of "protecting children"?
Oh, and .
Wow.
Made me look.
That would be $1.6 Billion.
1/1000th as much as $1.6 Trillion.
$230 per person in Tennessee.
That's... Not a lot.
It's like three years of Washinon States revenues - on only Cannabis.
It's like 2% of Texas annual real estate tax revenue.
0.5% of California's annual budget.
Approximately 123 milliseconds of federal spending.

Instead of having a rainy day fund.
Less, really, because they need to pay them more.
$17 is minimum wage here.
