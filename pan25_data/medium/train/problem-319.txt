The Dutch would do well to ignore the British conspiracy theorist - the British themselves are only just now learning how badly they were misled by Nigel Falange - and, after their truly awful brush with Naziism in WW2, restricting the food supply and coercing and controlling their population will ever be part of the Dutch national playbook.
The farmers create a lot of emissions and because of that we can't build houses or infrastructure, because that also creates the same kind of emissions.
So in order to build anything local farmers must reduce emissions, which they can't do.
And if the government wants to impose rules like cutting down the amount of cattle that they can have (wich is the biggest problem) these asshats start protesting with they machines, causing massive traffic jams on highways, bashing in state building and threatening politicians.
They even dumped rubbish with asbestosis on freeways and lit it on fire.
And if a company was hired to take it away they started threatening those companies.
