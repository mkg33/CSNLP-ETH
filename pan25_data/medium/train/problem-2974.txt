My understanding is upstate Pennsylvania rural hospitals are also under pressure or closing.
At one point, I was looking for a house and land in the mountains I could retire to, but now, I don’t think I would want to risk myself or my wife having a medical emergency and hoping we can get airlifted to Williamsport in time.
I work in IT for a chain of hospitals and clinics, previously worked in revenue.
At the beginning of the pandemic the org I work for received $290M from the federal government.
All of the money is being repaid via recoup of up to 25% on all Medicare remits.
We’re a decent sized chain that will weather this storm, but we’re definitely in the red.
We’ve had several meetings about hiring freezes and cutting contractors in recent months.
It makes sense that if our org is struggling, smaller hospitals won’t make it.
I’m worried about small hospitals and the communities they support.
This is a trend that has been ongoing for a while and COVID has made so much worse.
