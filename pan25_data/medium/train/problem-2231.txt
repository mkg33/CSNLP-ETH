Yeah I get that, put putting yourself in a place where retreat is essentially impossible since the bridge is out (no heavy weapons can be taken with the soldiers) does makes sense.
I just shocked they didn’t go via the land bridge to the Donbas where some of the most important fighting is occurring.
I guess to to fortify crimea but it seems like a horrible situation for them the soldiers there.
Wouldn’t they be backing themselves into a unsustainable situation where supplies that used to come from the bridge are no longer coming and if the land bridge is cut off they are essentially stuck with no resources or reinforcements.
I mean the quicker Ukrainian deals with this the better, but I can’t for the life of me understand Russian military strategy.
There are already long queues at the ferries, not without reason.
Their capacity is far from sufficient and the Kerch-Yenikale channel is notorious for extremely bad windy weather that shuts down all ferry traffic for days or weeks.
Without the bridge or a safe land corridor, the Russians are pretty much screwed.
