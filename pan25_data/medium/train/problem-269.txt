Agree.
I think the US needs to tread carefully with public government support of protests.
As for American citizens, send money, support however you can or want.
For the government though, we see what the legacy of perceived American coups can do to destabilize regions, true or not.
Sure they will always say it's an American coup, all the more reason to never make it one and make them all feckless liars and the movements against them strong of their own accord and not due to fickle outside support.
The nations of the Arabian peninsula only have money because we give them money via the oil industry.
We (by we, I mean Europe mostly) get oil and, in exchange, the Saudis get money and weapons.
Because of the massive profitability of the oil industry, Saudi Arabia and the other nations on the peninsula do not invest in any other industry.
This is why the luxuries that you'll find littered all over these "rich" nations are made in foreign countries, primarily the West.
Thus, I think the West could easily ruin the nations of the Arbian peninsula, they just have to stop some part of this trade network.
If the Saudis can't sell their oil, they can't make any money and their economy collapses.
The main reason why we don't is because of Iran.
