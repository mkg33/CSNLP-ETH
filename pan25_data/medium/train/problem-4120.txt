Mexico here.
I know you're trying to be funny but as someone who lives here you are mistaken.
In my state alone we have had 36 wind turbines up and running since 2020.
But yeah, sure, go ahead and kick down on us if it makes you feel better.
Meanwhile, my electric bill, thanks to this wind farm, is around $1 per day and, believe it or not, we actually have AC, lights, refridgerators, stoves, computers, etc.... you know, stuff that uses electricity.
Im not sure how big a mexican state is, but 36 wind turbines is basically nothing.
If I extrapolate from 2021 figures, the Netherlands have 3200 wind turbines.
And we are a tiny country of 17 million people.
Edit: I decided to look it up and mexico had 3200 wind turbines in 2021.
I guess the person I replied to meant wind farms or wind power plants, rather than turbines.
Having said that, this means Mexico and The Netherlands have a similar number of wind turbines, while Mexico has 7.5x the population.
I doubt a wind turbine would be used, many still think those steal our air, pollute our eyes, and makes god angry... not joking people here have really stupid believes about clean energy being bad and satanic.
