I posted recently about her district being the same area “Deliverance” was set in and filmed in and you could probably pull over to the side of the road randomly and hear banjos playing.
I got an indignant reply that that is now a suburb of high tech workers, etc.
if that’s true, it’s changed a lot since the last time I went through.
And I don’t think such a suburb would elect her ass.
I have a customer who has been coming in to my place of work for almost 3 years now spewing QAnon hilarity and calling my coworkers and I sheep.
We’ve known him for many years.
Even would consider him more of a kooky friend than a customer.
We just laugh about how crazy he’s gotten when he leaves.
One day he just came at me all the wrong, and I lost it on him.
Started screaming at him, going down the list of every bogus nut job prophecy he’s ever told us that turned out to not happen or be an obvious lie.
Finally he interjected and asked if I’d seen 2000 Mules.
I told him I had no idea what that was, and that was his big aha mic drop moment.
Do not let headlines like this lull you into a false sense of security that these people are losing interest or coming around.
The psychosis is real, and it is very alarming the extremes of what they are willing to latch onto in hopes that one day they will be able to tell us all, I told ya so!
