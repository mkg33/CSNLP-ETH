If a prosecutor lets off someone who said domestic extremism threats, and that person later goes on to say bomb a building… why should the lenient prosecution not be held accountable for the deaths?
The one thing that changes is that if the grandfather conspired to cover it up, he should be sharing a cell with his piece of shit grandson.
Doesn't matter if it's true or not, it is a failure of the system either way.
It just changes which part of the system we blame.
Either the Prosecutor was incompetent, the police were negligent or the grandfather conspired to cover it all up.
His grandpa is a state level (maybe national?)
legislator who is very pro MAGA and espoused his support during the Jan 6 insurrection.
His grandson’s track record of the bomb threat, etc, was somehow removed after the incident back then.
