Because McCarthy agreed to so many concessions to retain the speakership that he needs to keep as many members of his caucus happy as possible to avoid being usurped.
Every Republican who asked for committee assignments is going to get them is the point.
Small Business and S,S,&T aren’t the MOST coveted committees, so that’s why they went to Santos.
My point is that McCarthy is so weak as speaker that he absolutely cannot afford to make any new enemies or he’ll be unseated.
If he can get a member indebted to him by giving him committee assignments when the country is calling for his resignation, he at least has some people in his corner.
