Lol they were breaking down during the military parade.
And that’s when they were literally fresh of the line.
Still had that new tank smell before the soldiers shit all over it.
Every cutting edge MBT can be knocked out from the front by the current generation of MANPAD AT weapons.
An updated optics package makes that metal box a bit more survivable, but not much.
At this point, tanks need to be employed in limited offenses that seize a safer haven for them.
The longer they spend moving along a road from a railhead to an attack point, the longer they expose themselves to the hazards of modern weapons that hard counter them.
And that’s new tanks.
Old tanks are just heavy coffins that cost a lot to ship to the place the people inside them will die.
“Instead, the Kremlin has drafted—or lured into service with huge cash bonuses—hundreds of thousands of unhappy and largely unfit men, many of them in middle age.
Barely trained, minimally equipped and ambivalently led, these draftees die fast and easy in battle with hardened Ukrainian troops.”.
I like the term “ambivalently lead.” We could attack and maybe seize some territory, or we could go home.
Idk.
I’m ambivalent.
