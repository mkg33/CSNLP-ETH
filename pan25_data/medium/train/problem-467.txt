They did.
Russia is pushing new recruits into uniforms to fill the spots.
They lost a lot of tanks though and a lot of experienced (by comparison to the new meat anyway) are dead or out of action.
It really should but most people don't look into the details of what army divisions fought/lost in engagements.
Shit, I've only began to do it myself this year.
Like most people know the Battle of Normandy but they probably couldn't tell you the exact army divisions that fought there, y'know?
These guys were supposed to be some of the best of the best, the toughest motherfuckers driving tanks the Russian Army had, and by all accounts they ran for their lives during the Kharkiv Counteroffensive, literally crashing a few tanks into trees.
Ran for the hills and left thier tanks with the keys in the ignition.
Not quite, while they have take pretty massive losses (I think I saw something stating like, 50% of their tanks), they have not been outright destroyed yet.
On the other hand, the 4th Guards Tank Division (which is a part of this 1st Guards Tank Army) was more or less completely destroyed when Ukraine encircled Izium.
1st Guards Tank army was in charge of the thunder to Kyiv run that Russia attempted, which worked pretty well up until they actually needed infantry support (aka when they reached the outskirts of Kyiv.
).
