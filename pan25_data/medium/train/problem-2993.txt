My guess is that the number of such requests / returns are relatively small in comparison to allowing the entire state to take advantage of this procedure.
Thus, much easier to process than an entire state.

I can see where the states are empowered to send overseas voters Absentee Ballot Applications by electronic means, but my quick perusal did not find how the voters could vote by email.
With all the (unfounded) complaints of fraudulent voting, methinks opening the entire state to email voting would cause a much heavier workload on the verification process to try to assure the absence of fraud.
Yes, I agree that electronic / email voting would be much more convenient, but it opens the door for increased fraud, as well as complaints from voters who supposedly do not have email access, but want similar convenience.
The best part of physical ballot voting is that there is a paper trail that much harder to exploit.
An information system can be exploited and hacked and as soon as it happens just once the entire concept will be abandoned due to the volume of votes that can impact.
Just my $.02.
Thanks for the comment.
Here is the page for North Carolina email voting under UOCAVA.
True, I don't know if specifically the email practice has been adopted by other states.
But the question remains why overseas citizens would be granted access to different absentee voting practices than residents.
