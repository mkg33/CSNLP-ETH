Also, recently with the return of Blink-182’s original band it got a lot of attention a couple weeks ago.
I heard some tickets were 600+.
Not sure what the lowest prices were, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it was 100+ for cheap tickets.
I had the pleasure of taking my little sister to see her.
I wish she preform more songs from her early albums but she’s fun to see live even if you don’t know her music all to well.
For comparison in 2002 at the Pop Disaster Tour, I saw Blink-182, Green Day, and Jimmy Eat World for $38.50 with Ticketmaster “convenience” fees of $7.50.
Oh my goodness, that’s horrible.
Live Nation and Ticketmaster have been screwing people over for decades.
If any companies deserve stricter regulations they def do.
Ticketmaster also often buys and resells tickets for their own shows.
When tickets sell out they direct you to other websites where Ticketmaster resells tickets under another name.
