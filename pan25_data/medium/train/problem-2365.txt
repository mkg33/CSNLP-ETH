It's honestly just mind boggling to go from Russia is maybe the number 2 or 3 super power militaries of the world to knowing they are just a heap of hot garbage.
It's very astonishing knowing how many low level militaries could probably whip Putler badly after this botched invasion on their neighbor.
And boy do they deserve every negative thing that is happening to them.
I'm guessing this is what happens when you are so corrupt and steal the money that is supposed to go to your military and the fact that Putler holds on to "hey we have nukes so why spend money on my military when i can just scare my opponents" this is what happens when your bluff is called and ppl know you are not going to use your nukes.
So now he's in bad trouble bc he hasn't really invested in his military bc he thinks he can cling on to the fact that "we have nukes so what are you going to do."
Well, look in the mirror Putler this is what happens when you steal from your military and do not take it seriously.
Put yourself in Putin shoes(terrible place) all this will do is make him double down on his terror campaign.
If he takes out Ukraine no reparations owed.
Not a reason not to do it.
He will do his worst either way.
The thing to do is help Ukraine defeat his worst efforts.
The man is a pig with no regard for the cares, will or needs of others outside of his legion of sycophants.
Can’t reason with shit like that unless it’s greed based reasoning.
