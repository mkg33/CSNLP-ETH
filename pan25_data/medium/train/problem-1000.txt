Tyrant just means a cruel ruler, has got nothing to do with elections.
Also the last time I checked, NDA got only 37%, don’t know where you’re pulling that 80% from.
It helps that his supporters are bigoted assholes like him.
He should not have banned the documentary.
His voting share will actually increase if they come to know that he has a hand in the genocide.
Ok so I do agree you can be tyrannical without being undemocratic, but it is true that the NDA currently holds 303/355 > 80% of the Lok Sabha seats, and this is the fact claimed above.
37% is popular vote share but if you'll look at the comment above the claim is not made about this statistic.
They got 37% votes but got around 300+ seats which is highest ever in 3-4 decades.
Their popularity is going positively in the country and will easily win next term too.
Not to mention opposition party is a joke.
When will government employees actually start working for the public instead of running errands for politicians with fragile egos?
