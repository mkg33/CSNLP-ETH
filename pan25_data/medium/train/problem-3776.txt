In his deposition, Trump actually said that E Jean Caroll said she "liked" being raped by Trump in an interview with Anderson Cooper.
Wallace then played the interview and (shockingly) Caroll said no such thing.
The net effect of reading both should have been that you'd have greater confidence that she didn't do anything that bad.
The fact that the memos coming out had the opposite effect tells you everything you need to know about Trump voters.
