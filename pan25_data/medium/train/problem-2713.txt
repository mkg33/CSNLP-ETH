Now it only worked because people are stupid and have no idea what tariffs are.
They don't realize it's effectively a sales tax with extra steps.
Plus it's a tax that bypasses businesses entirely.
Yeah, businesses pay more for the raw materials and goods, so yes, they pay first.
But then businesses aren't idiots, so they raise sell prices to cover the expensive of the tariffs and pass 100% of the taxation right onto the general public, aka a tax that completely bypasses companies.
It's great for corporate America.
Plus it disproportionately scales more aggressively towards the poor, so win for rich people too.
It's effectively a flat rate not a percentage tax, so poor people just dive face first into that pile of shit.
