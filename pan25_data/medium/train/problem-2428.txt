I almost feel like a lot of Republican intransigence is rooted in that fact they just don’t WANT to admit their policies and politicians suck ass.
It’s like how an addict will blame absolutely everyone in the world for why they totaled their car by careening into their neighbors living room.
Because the only other option is admitting THEY’RE the ones with the problem.
