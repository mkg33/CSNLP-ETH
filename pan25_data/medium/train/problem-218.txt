eh there are some ways that allow you to send computationally intensive requests that can harm a server more than some other kinds of requests.
but I doubt it's a ddos, I suppose they could null route the traffic if that were the case but /shrug.
This is actually easier than you might think.
The internet uses a thing called the boarder gateway protocol(bgp) which is like a google maps for internet traffic.
You can setup your own bgp if you want.
Iirc most servers have their own bgp to tell the internet how they can be found.
You can reconfigure these things pretty easily so that any/all traffic on the internet goes through your server.
There have been several large incidents over the years.
One time youtube missconfigured one and started getting every piece of traffic that China generated (including classified stuff).
The reason we haven't done it yet is because itll only work once before people start to seriously consider making an alternative, more secure bgp.
So why waste it on russia when they are headed towards collapse anyways.
