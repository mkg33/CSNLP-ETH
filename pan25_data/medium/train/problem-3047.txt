But they really don't want Ukraine developing those same resources and offering a cheaper, non-hostile source of oil and gas and becoming an EU member.
That would be a real danger, and part of the reason they invaded.
I just don’t know Russia’s end game here.
There is no way you are going to hold a conquered region of people that despise you.
There will always be partisan activity and it will always cost more to hold than the value received from the land in the long run.
And now they have to foot the bill to reconstruct everything in the land that they’ve destroyed, try to make it habitable, and do all of this under the most crippling sanctions ever placed on a country.
Somebody help me understand.
They’re already hip deep in this fight.
They can’t afford to lose and can’t muster the might to win.
I’m thinking the best they can hope for is another major power joining in on their side; providing troops and arms.
Aside from that, the west just needs to keep feeding the Ukrainians weapons.
Every day russia gets weaker while Ukraine gets stronger.
