The West has exhausted all its options and patience.
NATO has a moral imperative to put boots on the ground in Ukraine NOW to preserve more innocent life.
Russia's facade is broken.
They are a paper tiger and lack the military capability to match the United States.
China is the bigger threat economically and militarily, and the likeliest trigger of WW3 that isn't another US civil war causing a power vacuum is Taiwan.
Fella, we're already in WW3, it just hasn't gone hot yet for the U.S. We can either linger around longer and let Ukraine get completely leveled as Russia and China accumulate more strenh, or we strike at the vipers neck now and mitigate the damage.
It has already begun, its just hasnt gone hot for the U.S. yet.
It will, it's just a matter of whether we get caught unexpectedly or take the initiative.
