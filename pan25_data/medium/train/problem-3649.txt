The use of "apparent" leaves room for further investigation and doesn't allow the authorities to quickly dismiss the possibility of something more sinister.
There is another suicide of top ranking Russian , this one is a former Russian police general who oversaw the crackdown on opposition activists.
He has been found dead in an apparent suicide at his home northwest of Moscow following his dismissal by President Putin in late January.
He is the latest high-ranking Russian security figure to have died by apparent suicide in recent months.
I seriously doubt Rapaport was the Russians.
How many targets must they have in the US, and that was the successful one with the competent agents?
Bill Browder has described Russian attempts on his life as "cartoonish".
If they were capable of committing assassinations on American soil while also fooling the local authorities and leaving no evidence behind Browder would've been offed years ago.
Putin even asked Trump to hand Browder over.
Even if they would've been the top suspects, they would've just denied it.
The one that I still find most confusing is Dan K. Rapoport.
He reportedly jumped to his death from his Washinon apartment in August.
Although the police do not suspect foul play his widow casts doubts on reports that her husband's death was self-inflicted.
I’ve been wondering about that one too.
My conspiracy theory is that they don’t wanna admit that the kremlin was able to get someone killed in the US capital.
I get what you mean, but it's important to pay attention to stories like this.
It's a reminder of how far some governments will go to suppress dissent and maintain their power.
