Its a real shame there is a duopoly and only really two viable options to choose from.
Huge shame that polarized dems or Gop will fight tooth and nail to tell you how different their parties are, while the exact same shit gets done over and over by the exact same demographic that controls both sides...but do go on and tell me how anyone that is a swing voter or already disenfranchised doesn't know whats going on..Frankly it seems like the polarized people in each party don't know whats going on and only really parrot their own parties talking points while ignoring virtually anything else, while constantly trying malign a group of people that is larger than either the DEMS or the GOP.
You are looking at the real majority and it for sure isnt one of the two parties in a duopoly.
Feel free to think otherwise, as it will take too much time breaking down the numbers for you, and chances are you will have already misunderstood something else.
