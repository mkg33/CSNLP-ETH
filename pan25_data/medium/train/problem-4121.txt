The Pakistani government.
The majority of Pakistanis don‘t know about it because they‘re not educated enough but will suffer because of it‘s governments decisions.
I feel sorry for them.
I’m very interested in what they choose to do.
At the very least they’ll get to experiment with their military.
Hopefully not at the expense of the Afghan people.
Pakistan has nurtured and propped up the Afghan Taliban for decades, allowing them to now support their TTP counterparts.
Pakistan and Pakistanis only have themselves to blame.
This is their karma for supporting these terrorists.
IMO, there are four possible nuclear wars that could happen right now, all of them highly unlikely but listed in descending order of probability:
I'm entirely unsure of how established they are in Pakistan, and whether or not they have even a remote chance of toppling the government, but I'd like to remind people reading this that Pakistan has nukes, and so does India — its rival.
Once Iran gets nuclear weapons, Iran-versus-Israel becomes possible, too.
And I'm willing to bet the Saudis want nukes too; that'd be Saudi Arabia-versus-Iran, but the odds of that happening in the next few decades are low.
