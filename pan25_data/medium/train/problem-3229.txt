The difference between rural and urban societies are most evident in the use of child labor.
Itâ€™s most evident when I see photos of children involved in farm labor.
The range of work from farm chores to migrant laborers, from Detasseling corn to walking the rows.
The dichotomy between exploitation and typical farm life is difficult for a City dweller to understand.
Also this is rural China, but people in here seem to be trying to apply this to the rest of the world.
It's basically still the 1950s in those villages.
These aren't even smaller (but still big compared to most countries) rural cities, these are villages near Tibet.
Not only that some predominantly female professions like nurses rely on women to stretch to the limits and beyond to the point that they have started to leave the professions.
Argument is that even today in developed nations the expectation is that some women dominated professions people are expected to "stretch" because its a "calling" and based on the fact that people are quitting it has finally reached the limit.
Exactly what in the article / study suggests that the quality of the work men did was in any way superior ?
Even in developed countries women in general still have to work harder than men and some of the professions still rely on women stretching to the limits.
For example nurses at least in Finland to the point that they are changing professions.
You keep using nurses as an example, yet seem completely oblivious of how hard doctors (of both genders) work - especially during residency.
And men can be nurses too.
