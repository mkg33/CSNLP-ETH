I just picture a scenario of an alien civilisation that developed on a planet with an atmosphere that wouldn't accommodate airfoil transportation so all they know is balloons, after some time and research they finally figured out what mixture of gasses would float safely in this strange new occupied planets atmosphere so they could safely fly and make contact with the intelligent species living there only to find themselves being repeatedly shot down.
Soooo… according to the article, the Chinese army started scheduled training drills in the area this morning, and all of a sudden, fishermen saw a ufo?
The interesting element here is likely not the UFO/UAP moniker both the US and China are labeling these objects with.
The truly interesting part is how this info is being distributed, covered, and conveyed to the public over the past week.
Why this description, and more importantly, why now?
there are only so many times you can use the word balloon in a pentagon briefing before people start to laugh it off.
The US just confirmed the others were balloons too.
Schumer said it on an interview on ABC this morning.
They haven’t blamed them on China though.
Not officially.
But he spun the announcements of the balloons into talking about China’s balloon spy program.
when they referred to the big balloon size they said 2/3 busses they where referring to the payload.
so it s entirely possible that to have a blimp or whatever other kind of balloon with a small car size at the bottom.
but this was yesterday, as of today it seams like it wasn t a balloon at all and they still don t know whay it was.
