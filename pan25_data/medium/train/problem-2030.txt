We're seeing this play out in real-time all across the country.
The GOP are actively attempting to dismantle democracy and the rule of law with every action they take, from disenfranchising tens of millions of minority voters, installing corrupt election officials, empowering state legislatures to arbitrarily overturn election results (look up "independent state theory" and prepare to be terrified), elevating ultra-partisan christofascist thugs to the Supreme Court (plus thousands of lower, but no less important, judicial appointments), instituting state laws designed to criminalise campaigns that encourage voting — everywhere you look, the GOP is openly prosecuting a slow motion fascist coup, and they're at most one election away from that coup succeeding.
