According to Wikipedia, Kristina Karamo has a "master's degree" in Christian Apologetics from Biola University's Talbot School of Theology and an undergrad communications degree.
Edit: Biola University, not to be confused with Ebola, is the genius marketing ploy of the Bible Institute of Los Angeles, which was founded in 1908 by Lyman Stewart, president of the Union Oil Company of California, which is also known as Unocal, later swallowed by Chevron.
Now why would an oil baron waste money starting an evangelical Christian university?
