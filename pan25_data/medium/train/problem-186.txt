As someone whose been in the military for 17 years, this is a flawed misconception.
Of your population of 140 million only a fraction would have the physical and mental ability to be a solider.
It takes anywhere from 6 months to a year to train a private.
It takes even longer to train people like pilots.
With full mobilization Russia won't be fielding an Army; they'll be fielding a mob and a mob is worthless.
The "quantity is a quality of its own" stuff only matters if you can get this mob to the fight.
These guys are going to die crossing a field.
That soviet legacy can only be used once.
After that, they will have to rebuild as a ruined economy that is probably smaller than Spain by now.
It will take decades to rebuild especially while under sanctions.
I know the Russians dfon't care about the losses but the loss of equipment is always going to matter to the war effort.
This isn't just expensive specialist equipment such as tanks but also stockpiles of ammunition, light infantry equipment and fuel and such.
