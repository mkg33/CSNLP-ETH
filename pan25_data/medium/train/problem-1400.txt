The GOP/Republican party has been one of the most destructive forces in the history of humankind.
Factoring in their power, influence, and reach around the nation and world, the amount of pain and suffering directly attributable to them is practically unfathomable.
I can't imagine any significant donors putting money on that lame horse and supporting him as an independent candidate.
With the possible exception of the DNC, of course.
They deserve it for not impeaching him when they had their two chances to do so.
I hope he loses the GOP primary, forms the Trump Party, and splits the GOP vote for a decade or more.
Right, I was referring to the Senate Republicans not voting to convict.
Because of those missed opportunities, now he is an albatross around their necks.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Pretty good analysis of the sewage ditch the GOP is still stuck in after it ran off the road many years ago.
In that scenario, then whoever made the deal with Trump would be completely disincentivized to actually follow through on a pardon, nobody wants to be the next Gerald Ford in U.S. politics.
I'd be ok with that, too.
