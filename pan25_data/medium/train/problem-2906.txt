I can think of some reasons.
If these are more significant surveillance intrusions that prompted such an aggressive response, it really starts to droll up war drums at a sensitive time.
Russia is going bats, China being China... countries trying to join NATO, we're supplying lots of money and weapons to Ukraine, and we're still very much within a global pandemic aftermath with economic uncertainty.
These kinds of conditions are ripe for global conflict, and I don't think Biden really desires to be the face dealing with that.
It's one thing to say, "Oh yeah, they had some dumb balloon but it gains them no new info, so we just let it slide."
It's another to say "Yeah so these ones were not only threats to airspace but also had some tech that posed a significant risk to national security and they're sending dozens whereas before they weren't".
The question in the latter case becomes "Okay.
So what are we gonna do to respond?
".
Are you talking about Richard Doty?
The book/documentary Mirage Men is a great resource for anyone looking to learn more about that story.
It's some really sick stuff.
This is unironically true.
In the late 40s and 1950s the US military invested heavily in high-altitude balloons for reconnaissance.
This was when UFO sightings really began to take off.
Then Sputnik happened and rendered balloons obsolete, but it's always been rumored that the programs were kept alive as a backup.
