There are few things in life as reliable as Russian shills claiming Ukraine has been murdering innocents in Donbas.
But, lets suppose for a second that was true, which it is not.
Russia could have appealed to the UN and requested a security force to protect the region, or it could have used its allegedly superior air defense (lol) to shoot down the alleged bombings from Ukraine.
It did neither.
Instead, it gave weapons to Igor Girkin and others who promptly used them to blow up an airliner.
Then Russia committed to an ill fated invasion of all of Ukraine, not just the Donbas, which is currently not going so well.
What is with this obsession over balance or "global equilibrium"?
What good is that balance if achieving it means accepting deep immorality?
Doesn't the world need justice instead of this bullshit?
> Once you’ve been to Cambodia, you’ll never stop wanting to beat Henry Kissinger to death with your bare hands.
You will never again be able to open a newspaper and read about that treacherous, prevaricating, murderous scumbag sitting down for a nice chat with Charlie Rose or attending some black-tie affair for a new glossy magazine without choking.
Witness what Henry did in Cambodia – the fruits of his genius for statesmanship – and you will never understand why he’s not sitting in the dock at The Hague next to Milošević.
