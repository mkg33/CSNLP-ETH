extremely na√Øve of you to think that a common "distaste for US global dominance" is a trivial unifying factor amongst the BRICS nations.
perhaps you didn't even read the article i linked above, nor the quote i pulled from that article that says "If accepted, the new proposed BRICS members would create an entity with a GDP 30% larger than the United States, over 50% of the global population and in control of 60% of global gas reserves."
that is far from trivial and I hardly believe these nations would announce their application into BRICS publicly if they thought it was doomed to fail.
the point is to still have Russia supply oil but limit their profits.
We don't actually want Russia to stop supplying oil because if they do global prices skyrocket.
Yet if we limit them to just enough profit so they don't stop we can limit the amount it helps them in their war effort.
Russia doesnt want to stop with supplying.
Its not like theres a tap and you can just switch it off.
If they dont use it for a prolonged period the results would be catastrophic.
