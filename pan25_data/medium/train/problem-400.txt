Bear in mind that he's part of the Sunni minority and doesn't necessarily reflect the views of the leaders despite being a cleric.
I don't know much about him, but a quick google seems to show that he's been critical of the regime in the past.
Your right sunnies are critical of shittes but because your ignorant.
Not everything is black and white but put this in perspective.
Unless the military sides with protestors probably not as sad as that is.
My hope is even if revolution doesn't come from this, people remember.. they hold onto how their government really treats them and they stay mad.
and shit like this, "The regime's oppressive security forces used live bullets when opening fire on protesters, even small children, according to local activists.
".
Sunnis would never be in charge, they’re such a small minority.
And I don’t think he’s pushing for that anyway.
But a vote wouldn’t work with the current government, so I guess it’s a moot point, unless he’s pushing for separatism.
He hasn't provided any details aside from this, and he only mentioned it in a sermon.
It's very much wishful thinking and would never work because the regime won't wilfully give up power.
