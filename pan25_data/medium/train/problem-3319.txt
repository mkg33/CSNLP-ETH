I dont think they understand when they put someone in charge that the people rally behind, they wont be spared in the purge.

Hell Mitch McConnell suddenly has a target on his back via trump due to turn-coating against trump.
I mean hes old and already got 1 foot in the grave, but he's been more a less part of the GOP since hes been an adult.
You'd think the trump shakeup would make them realize they almost done fucked up royally and got themselves killed and not to double down on complete control.
