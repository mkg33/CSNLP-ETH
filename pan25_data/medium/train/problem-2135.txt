Why is there still traffic allowed between Kalingrad and Poland/Lithuania?
Shut down all truck/train/car/pedestrian traffic.
Absolutely no problem.
I didnt wanted to attack you or your country(Edit:or some of your metal bands i really like) , just wanted to say why i downvoted it.
I definitely remember an article about a guy setting up a fake border and a fake border crossing some kms from I think Finland's border on the Russian side, and collecting, uh, visa fees for crossing.
Blaming Poland, but at the same time inviting airlines to open flights to the Middle East (spoiler alert: not for tourism purposes), (link in Lithuanian) and throwing tantrums every single day on almost every neighbouring country, not even mentioning Ukrainian war and what they're doing there.
Eat shit, fucktards.
I dont think it is funny at all thats why i downvoted him, that has nothing to do with feeling powerful.
How would you feel if i makes jokes about estonia and say something about their independence from the ussr?
Jokes are not funny for everyone, i have heard enough storys from my grandparents how they escaped and how cruel it was.
