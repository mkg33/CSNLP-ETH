After the joke of a response when taking Crimea from world leaders, there is no room to not be an unmovable wall to any Russian threats (or actions).
Those weapons are horrific, the thought of someone believing that using one for any reason ...blows every rational neuron in my brain.
But it is more dangerous at thia point not to see this through.
They let Russia bark and take, bark and take...we have been through this before.
Stop the wannabe hitler now before someone decides to join his side and start WWW3...(and you dont count Belurus, your dictator and any of his piss ants dont rate enough to count t for an alliance.
).
Also, it's a fully correct thought, but for a different set of reasons.
Okay, let's say you don't believe in Russian nuclear doctrine (which says nukes can only be used in case the enemy uses WMDs, or threatens the existence of the country).
But real problem here is efficiency.
Strategic nukes are usually underestimated: people refuse to see how much of an overkill this stuff is.
Fallout would be enough to hit both NATO territories and Russia itself.
Not even talking about how, you know, Russia plans to USE that ground later, thus sticking to conventional shells.
