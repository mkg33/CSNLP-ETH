Unfortunately for those green pilots, what Chinas provocative drills don't tell them, is that in a live fire exchange, the majority of those planes won't reach their targets and an even greater majority will not return to base.
Got to love these 'leaders' who love to play games with their peoples lives to bolster their own fragile egos, eh Pooh Bear?...
I’m unsure of the name of the YouTube channel but it’s like a mapped battle sim and information is put in with weapon types/ranges/functionality and many of the fights turn real and raw real quick when the deaths mount.
It goes in depth of jets diving and averting missiles and accounts for missiles that have better acquisition measures.
Nothing prepares you for the death of your wingmen and the adrenaline of avoiding your own death under fire.
There is no accurate way to predict how pilots who have never seen combat will react when their planes start falling from the sky, especially when 'all' your pilots are green.
You can game it out all you want, that's just not reality.
When a dictator repeatedly acts like he's going to invade and it would be a bad idea for him to do so, there's still a pretty good chance that he's going to do it anyway.
Letting freedom and democracy loving Chinese leave China is actually a geostrategically advantageous move.
It's good ideologically - as it exposes Chinese to universal values, rule of law, democracy, freedom of speech, free media.
It's good economically - as these hard working and well educated Chinese move abroad they contribute their labour and innovation to the host countries economies.
While sapping the Chinese economy - a phenomena called brain drain.
And its helpful demographically - young people leaving China further exacerbates their demographic problem (aging population).
