Yep, GOP voters and the Fox Media Network (among other things) have created the perfect environment for grifters.
When all else fails, go be a right wing media personality or GOP politician.

McCarthy has already said that it is for the voters of his district to decide.
He basically said that they voted him in and they can recall/vote him out and the only way that McCarthy will remove him is if he broke and is convicted of breaking campaing laws.
Santos is the distraction that the Republicans need.
He is not going anywhere.
The more outlandish he gets, the more the GOP can do their shady shit while everyone focuses on the clown.
It’s so funny when they use “the voters chose him” as an excuse.
The voters voted for a guy who graduated college on a volleyball scholarship, went to Harvard for an MBA, worked at Citibank and Goldman Sachs, and ran successful animal charities.
They didn’t vote for this guy.
Did he even finish high school?
I know he lied about where he went.
I think it’s hard to kick him out unless he actually broke a law.
Looks like they might get him on the campaign money with that.
