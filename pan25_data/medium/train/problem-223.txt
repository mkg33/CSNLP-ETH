Republicans would need to be in lockstep for every major decision, which doesnâ€™t seem likely given their current troubles.
I could see Dems pushing legislature through the House with help from 1-2 moderate Republicans.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
This makes official what everyone projected yesterday, the Republicans definitely have 218 seats in the House.
There are still seven undecided seats, so the Republicans could have as few as 218 seats -- a bare majority -- or as many as 225 seats, still pretty slim.
Most likely it will be somewhere in the middle, maybe 221 or 222 seats.
