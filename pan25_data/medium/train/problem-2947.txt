Feel like we never really had any other choice.
For all the talk of democracy from dems, I feel like there was never really any other candidate for this Senate seat.
He was appointed by Newsome to replace Harris.
Then ran in a jungle primary with about 50 other candidates.
An incumbent that is supported by the the dem establishment is never going to lose in that situation.
And obviously never going to lose to a Republican in California.
Now he'll go largely unchallenged for as long as he wants to remain the Senator and does not have a scandal.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
In general, be courteous to others.
