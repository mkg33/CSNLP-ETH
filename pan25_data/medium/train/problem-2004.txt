When you have HSBC and Deutsche bank it is a bit surprising.
But on closer reading, doesn't seem like money laundering and corruption are seen as an unethical measure.
Everyone in the front office (part of the bank that matters) is a Democrat.
Not a surprise, you're talking about a bunch of educated New York / other major city residents.
With that being said, a corporation just tries to make money.
The individuals don't matter, you should never trust the institution.
Instead, pass and enforce laws to incentivize the behavior you want.
Contrary to what people think, institutions like GS love regulation.
Maybe not every rule, but overall a more regulated financial sector plays to big, established banks.
Think about it, they have armies of lawyers, compliance departments, and established oversight procedures to manage regulatory risk.
Not to mention the capital to cover any fines that do come when those systems fail.
Meaning they don't need to pay for liability insurance.
But obviously it's not objective.... And yes, it's led to the very wealthy becoming even wealthier.
It's not simple, I am conflicted about it.
