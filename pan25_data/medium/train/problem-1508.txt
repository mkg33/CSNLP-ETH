Joe Biden is the absolute most popular president in all of US history.
It’s a fact, look it up jack.

Lol.
The state of r/ politics… ahhhh yes, the greatest threat to our nation.
Shit that most people aren’t even aware of because they can’t afford to travel.
Praise Joe for free is of this well to do boomer problem.
Just the facts jack.
Hey I’m not joking.
He’s Literally the most popular president in us history, which is why he is so loved.
You constantly see people walking around with Biden t-shirts, hats, flags.
People love this guy.
