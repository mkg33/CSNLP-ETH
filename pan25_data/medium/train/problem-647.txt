Did you know that only 45% of all UN condemnations are about Israel now?
This year Israel-Palestine almost broke the top 25 most violent ongoing conflicts!
They need to crank those numbers up.
as i said a Nation state.
not an inanimate magical object from the works of JRR Tolkien, i can't stress that point enough.
even if the UN did create them, doesn't mean the UN can destroy them.
let's be even handed here, Israel is the UN's first project so everyone who opposes Israel tries to use the UN as if it was the fire of mount doom.
Israel wasn't a UN project, they wanted it to be but the Arabs rejected the UN proposal and tried to genocide the Jews.
choose one, those aren't contradictory, but the notion of Israel being enabled if not outright created by the UN is a common one among their enemies.
if you want to be pedantic and absurdly detailed - Israel wasn't founded by the "Jews who won the war" but rather the Jews who lived in the mandate of Palestine since before it was the mandate of Palestine, as Zionist (as in Jewish people who advocate for a Jewish homeland in old Judea) settlements have been there since the ottoman empire, Ben-Gurion being the best example.
they formed the structure of what became the state of Israel, did the fighting since the 20s when the Arabs originally wanted to expel them.
Ha-Yishuv, look it up.
48 was the culmination, not the beginning of the existential struggle.
