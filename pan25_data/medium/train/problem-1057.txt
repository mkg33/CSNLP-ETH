According to reports, Russian school children are being trained in how to use combat weapons (rifles, grenades, etc.)
and how to drill, reminiscent of the "Hitler Youth".
"And hey, look at all these military salaries we mysteriously stopped having to pay this year too.
Dunno why /shrug?
Maybe those troops just evaporated or something.
Also if we don't admit they are dead we don't have to pay death benefits either That payed for 2 whole yachts and a new gold plated dingy for komrad Putins' new fishing boat.
When you dont spend any of the budget on social programs for the citizens, you are likely going to have budget surpluses.
I support good finances in government, but not the way Putin is doing it.
Well, they are going to need it.
Wars and occupations are expensive.
My question is, with their looming demographic decline, where will they get all the new blood to spill?
In addition, the church is "strongly encouraging" all women that can bear children to do so.
I predict they'll use toddlers as live bombs like the Viet Cong did in Vietnam.
It's amazing how a single individual can destroy not only his present country but also the country's future.
All because of his hubris and fragile ego.
