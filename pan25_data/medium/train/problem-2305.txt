We need to start calling male 'circumcision' what it is - male genital mutilation.
I remember going down a weird rabbit hole when doing research for a paper I was writing on this.
The few research articles I could find where men had got circumcised in their adulthood all pointed to the men's unhappiness with their choice.
Added to that were studies in a couple of African countries which showed that the lack of a foreskin was only effective in protecting against HIV IF it was also paired with sex education.
If not, then you'd be just as much at risk as if you were uncircumcised.
Literally only one research paper - from Turkey - said it was a good idea for guys to get circumcised and that was only because it apparently enhanced women's pleasure.
But number 1, sorry, pumping away without lube wouldn't be the most comfortable, and number 2, there are better ways to satisfy a woman than just jack hammering inside her.
Male genital mutilation as well.
Men are already dealing with a lower nerve count and then they slash even that.
Genital mutilation has to go.
I don’t get why in this age, it keeps happening.
Completely unnecessary bullshit because of culture and especially religion.
Medically necessary ones are obviously an exception.
If there’s a problem that needs to be dealt with, it’s the right move for sure.
Edit: Turns out we don’t actually know how many nerve endings the penis has.
Regardless, the unnecessary mutilation of genitals is a horrific thing and should be stopped completely.
