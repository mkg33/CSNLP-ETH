ArsTechnicas most recent article about the avian flu outbreak mentioned the potential danger of minks as a mammal capable of spreading mutated versions of the H5N1 influenza.
This is starting to look like a worst case scenario.
They can write that on our mass graves in 20 years when this catches up with us.
"They really needed eyelash extensions and mink fur car dangles".
I learned recently that nowdays they are raised, tortured and slaughtered to primarily produce eyelash extensions.
I don't know why, but that seems even worse than fur coats to me.
Given the absurd rise in corronoviruses in just the last 20 years, this mass farming and cramped transmission is going to catch up with us with these flus as well.
Given that recent strains have been exceptionally agressive in birds, and the beginnings of more mammal to mammal transfer, I think we should be spending a lot of money figuring out what industries to eliminate while bird and mammal to human transmission remains at an all time low.
Otherwise it seems like it's only a matter of time before we get an unfortunate surprise..
It's not a lot of money to make sure you study properly and eliminate industries that are pointless.
We spent trillions on this pandemic.
Could have literally ended world hunger for a decade.
