Wind energy is not very environmentally friendly, considering the significant waste they produce in replacement parts and lubrication.
Then there is the fact that Norway already produces 98% renewable energy, mostly attributed to hydropower.
The wind farms that are being protested were already deemed illegal by the Norwegian Supreme Court in 2021.
The protest is regarding the fact that they are still not de-constructed, despite the Supreme Court ruling.
Other methods must need to have parts replaced and maintenance waste too - or other waste that is produced as a result.
Is it worth writing wind energy off as not worth pursuing in other countries because its not environmentally friendly in other countries who say, rely heavily on coal?
Of course, compared to something like coal plants, wind energy is less emmissive.
But compared to other renewable sources such as hydro, nuclear (technically not renewable, but so effecient that it may aswell be), and even solar.
Wind energy is just horribly space inefficient, resource intensive, and damaging to surrounding landscapes and wildlife.
