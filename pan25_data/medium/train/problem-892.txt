The original comment is just repeating an old bit from a George Carlin standup, which I guess is a humoristic nihilist take ”we’ll all die eventually, so whatever, but the planet will go on around the sun regardless of what we’ll do.” Yea, it’s getting old.
What if tens/hundreds of thousands die over the next few years because of government inaction and expanding fossil fuel industries?
I recently watched the kurzgesa video about the meteor that killed the dinosaurs.
The damage was roughly equivalent to basically blowing all of our nukes at once, and nearly killed everything on the surface of the earth.
Couple of years went by (millions, which isn’t much on the grand scale) and here we are.
I’m pretty sure we’d have to work pretty god damn hard to entirely kill the planet for good, try as we might.
The earth and sun will be here for many millions or billions of years to come, way after we’re gone.
Look up PETM, by far the largest mass extinction event in Earth’s history.
And what we are doing right is even worse than what happened back then.
