Joe Miller interestly is the attorney who is currently representing AK House member David Eastman in a disqualification bid.
David Eastman is an Oath Keeper member and has said some very racist and sexist stuff during his time in office.
He is kind of known as a pariah.
But he keeps getting elected in Sarah Palin's former district of Wasilla.
Eastman has a court case going on right now due to this disqualfication provision on the Alaska Constitution that may remove him from office.
The main part of the trial is just before Christmas with Miller as attorney.
