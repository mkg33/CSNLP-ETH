The show starts out rocky, but only goes up from there.
It's developed and executive produced by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg.
They then went on to EP Ennis' other big work The Boys, so it's kind of like they cut their teeth on Preacher first.
In both cases, each production has done a great job of rounding out the edgiest edges that Ennis could come up without compromising the story.
On top of that, the whole cast is top notch.
