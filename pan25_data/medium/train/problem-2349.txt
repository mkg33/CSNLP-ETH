I think you really underestimate the effects of social media in the world.
If you look at WeChat in China or telegram/WhatsApp in India, you will be shocked.
John Oliver did a bit on WhatsApp I believe in India and how fast fake news spreads.
The new media platforms are super successful at serving content to people who want it.
In Iran, the youth are rejecting the system because they have the ability to organize through these services.
The older populations and traditionalist are doing the same.
I think given the supreme leader is already saying America is doing it, that ship has sailed.
Still no weapons though.
Peaceful revolutions are effective.
The conservative hardliners, yes.
But there are plenty of normie people in the country that don’t like the government but also don’t like America.
But the threat of an American coup overthrowing their government (again) might just push them into the arms of the hardliners.
But if the revolution is seen as an organic Iranian revolution, they might support the protesters.
