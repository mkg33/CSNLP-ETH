Funding people dragging the Overton Window to the right isn't a great long term strategy, independent of nice or not nice.
I think there's certainly some value in being willing to play hardball.
But "not nice" isn't inherently wise just because nice is unwise.
Punching babies on the campaign trail wouldn't be nice either, but it also wouldn't help anything.
What if someone hears something from one of these loons they pumped up and goes and shoots up a building because of “voter fraud”.
