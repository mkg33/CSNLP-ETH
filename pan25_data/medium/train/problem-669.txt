It's how everyone classifies groups of people according to imaginary labels.
All lefts think this way, all rights think that way, all women think this way, all men think that way, all of Gen X thinks this way, all Boomers think that way, and so forth.
Individuals are not taken into consideration, there is no room for policy, pros or cons, detailed discussions that would lead to viable solutions to social and economic challenges.
The obsession with ideology is the worst, especially since it's dead.
Can't change it, I digress.
