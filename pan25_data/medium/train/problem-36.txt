Nothing.
In a country like Bulgaria (small territorially and economically), most likely the owners/CEOs are family or have very close ties to the politicians.
See, when communism fell, privatisation happened.
Basically this means that everyone got some stock in whatever company they worked.
But, there was barely any money to buy food, so most people sold off their stock to shady guys (mutri - мутри; also slang for faces) waiting at post offices or something to that effect.
So the power was quickly concentrated in a few people that already had money - ex-communist politicians and those closest to them.
Actually it’s more of a public sentiment rather than lobbyism from the coal company.
The target to phase out coal was taken in 2021, however since then the price of gas has increased, inflation has gone up, salaries are stagnant, energy deficit has increased.
And for those who say to build a new reactor, of course how long did it take to build reactor in your country?
And if you rush it, can you guarantee it’s safety?
Rather that than more reactors, or another nuclear plant.
This is considering that in the last couple of years, the Danuble river which supplies the cooling water for the Kozloduy plant has nearly run dry.
Oh and not to mention that people are actually feeling the indifference shown by the western EU nations when it comes to solidarity and feel that everything in their country is being dictated by the west with no benefits in return.
This remind me of the scene in “dont look up” where the president has a backroom meeting with a mega donor and then they turn the rockets around and decide to let the meteor hit because its made of gold and presents an opportunity for “investors”.
Then it hits and they all die.
