Once upon a time, I worked there (for one of the carpet companies).
I took a huge pay cut and went into another industry to get away from that place.
I am a white female and was treated like a complete outsider.
The other white females who were from there were especially aggressive toward me, and I'm just from a neighboring state.
There was so much mental illness in that community.
I plan to avoid Dalton for the rest of my life and I'm so glad I quit that job.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
