Reminds me of the Bourne movies.
They always stop the group of bad guys and then the movie ends with some dude saying “this was bad and it’s done… and here is this new organization that is totally not the same, but doing the same stuff”.
And that’s how you get never ending sequels.
I'm confused.
Online Brazilians?
Are you using the dvd tray on your computer to remove unwanted hair from your nether regions or burning it off with a 4090?
Much like online Brazilians (I'm probably dating myself here...), religious people get a bad rap because the "good ones" don't immediately reveal themselves as religious.
This fire has been quiet for many years, but the blood of innocent brothers & sisters has created an inferno.
Many will be fooled by the disbanding of the morality police and the empty promises.
They are evil and cunning and acting out of fear.
To those that watch and stay quiet as the blood of our children is spilled on the streets, I ask you humbly and respectfully to please listen to the fire in your heart.
Stand with them.
