It might get of note, that due to historical quirks half the ruling monarchs of the country are appointed by the Pope.
The two princes that rule the country together don't actually have much in the way of real power, but technically the Catholic Pope picks half of them by appointing a Bishop for the neighbouring Spanish region and the French people elect the other Prince when they elect their president.
From now on same-sex couples can legally get married and adopt in the country of Andorra and transgender people can legally change their name and gender.
first we need to stop being the penguins' ultra orthodox bitch and allow civil marriage in the country (you can marry abroad and it will be recognized here but yeah).
In Italy, Greece, Czech Republic and Estonia, gay people can get civil unioned, which is basically the same as marriage.
And in many of the other countries, gay couples also get some rights/recognition.
Because it is harder and the religious homophobes will oppose it even more.
But it will eventually happen, it is only a matter of time.
It's a numbers game, the more old people die, the less political fallout this new law will have.
Also if the government is a right wing political party, they will be less willing to pay the political price for such change, since it is mostly their voters who oppose it.
But you could allow adoption while also only having same sex civil union.
You could even have same sex adoption without even having same sex civil union.
It's 2 different things though obviously closely related(because the resistance to both comes from the same homophobia).
Thats not related with the wedding thing, at least not directly.
The countries that dont have same sex marriage are more homophobic, so they also happen to not allow same sex adoption.
