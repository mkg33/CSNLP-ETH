I don't understand how you could possibly say that.
All we heard during Brexit was how the British were going to take back those jobs that have been given to immigrants.
All those jobs they took away from you, you were going to charge and take those back.
Start charging.
Then you get factory and warehouse jobs that are in the same place.
Where the operators don't want to employ UK workers.
As there is the danger they might have to make people permanent staff.
Rather than have a steady stream of rotating agency workers.
Coming and going from Europe.
Idk about europe or britain, but here in Australia its generally a job for people having a working holiday, and immigrants.
Fruit/produce picking jobs are hard, skilled, seasonal labour which requires that the workers travel around, live onsite and follow the harvests in other countries as well.
And what was happening is the farmer would charge exorbitant amounts for rent, transport and food, so much so that after this was accounted for the wotkers actual paycheck was next to nothing.
And you had to live on the farm to do the job.
So when covid happened and there were no immigrants or holidaymakers to do the jobs, the farmers all complained of spoilt crops because there was noone to pick.
So the tabloids all ran "NoOnE wAnTs To WoRk" and cited fruit picking farms as an example.
So a bunch of aussies did the jobs, and then talked about the conditions to media until everyone knew not to touch those jobs with a 50ft pole.
The "task" is for a few months.
It's also hard, physical and skilled.
And yes, the travelling workers live onsite.
Therefore, if you want to pay a UK based person to do the same job, they would have to travel to the area, live there for three months, and be able to do the job.
And unless they're going to follow the job abroad, then they won't get paid for the other months of the year.
So what do you pay them?
Triple?
Quadruple?
