Nah.
China does not want to attack USA unless they've become stupid.
China is struggling more internally right now, this was most likely to distract their citizens with some nationalism pride.
that was my initial thought when i found out we were not going to shoot it down immediately—maybe the point was to observe the military response to a threat over midwest america, a place that typically does not get that sort of attention.
Like sure our economy is slipping and I have to pay for a mortgage for a house that isn't built but damn we going against america.
Not to mention the way the ocean currents work around the island… from my understanding there are only 2 months a year which are calm enough to launch an amphibious assault with enough volume to land the troops and gear required.
That’s why you see China act tough around spring/fall every year.
Given they can’t sustain an invasion fleet anchored off the coast, it’s a suicide mission if they can’t establish a foothold and air superiority in a month because the troops landed will inevitably be left behind waiting for large scale reinforcements.
