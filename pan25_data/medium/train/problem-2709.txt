It's time for NATO to carry out offensive cyberattacks against Russia.
Russia has been cyber-attacking NATO countries for years and NATO does nothing.
It's time to deter those assholes.
Shut down Russia's power grid or something.
Nah.
Hack their television stations.
Set every channel to broadcast video showing the devastation in Ukraine, as well as what's happening to their own soldiers.
Show the Russian people how much senseless loss of life has occurred as a direct result of Putin's genocidal campaign.
Most people in this world just want to live their lives in peace.
They don't want to be disturbed, or have their quiet lives interrupted.
If that means responding positively to polls about war acceptance in a regime as oppressive as Russia's?
I have no doubt that many would voice their favor.
They're made to feel isolated there.
Alone.
But shatter that peace.
Show them that their fathers, husbands, brothers, and sons have been dying in service of atrocities...
Prove to them that their families have been shattered by this madman's campaign... Give all the people of Russia the dose of cold hard truth they have so long been denied...
