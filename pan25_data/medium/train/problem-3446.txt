I mean that whole thing where Trump tried to play strongman and did his damndest to nullify and overturn the votes of Americans in order to overturn a democratic election.
Republicans are broken.
Even worse than before.
300 billion in severe weather damage over the past two years.
Because of Republicans sucking up to the fossil fuel industry.
Russia invading Ukraine with the blessings of the GOP.
Trump's handling of Covid.
Trump's idiotic trade war with China...
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Iâ€˜m pretty sure you failed to at least mention one.
You know, that whole Jan6 thing whereTrump tried his best to become the first Dictator of The United States.
Yeah all the money we're having to spend to keep an eye on Trump's traitorous stooges across the country.

I take some issue with characterizing interest on the federal debt as money "thrown down the toilet".
Obviously, unnecessary debt is something we want to avoid and too much of that happens.
Over half of the federal debt is held by citizens, though, and a lot of those interest payments find their way back into the economy.
So, not all bad.
