It's best if the west can pressure Russia to release these funds to Ukraine voluntarily.
If they are just taken it undermines the system.
Although the west could probably apply enough pressure, especially with a new leader.
Ideally russia would release those funds.
But let's be honest, they never will.
And in that case, we should take it.
It's the only way that russia will pay ukraine anything.
Yes, it tells the world "if you're planning to start a war, you cannot trust the west with your assets".
Which is fine, we shouldn't be facilitating warring nations anyway, and we shouldn't seek to profit from it.
Meanwhile, anyone who isn't planning to start a war will understand their funds are still safe.
China's dollar reserves are in US Treasuries.
They can't just pull the money out.
They'd have to sell it on the open market, and trying to sell off their entire portfolio of USD (and probably EUR/GBP) bonds would force them to sell at a massive loss, and also completely kill their foreign currency reserves.
Russia (the people in government and those that support them) never pays for anything, even if they agree.
They are thieves, liars and deal-breakers.
They stole the Romanian Treasure after reneging on their deal to return it after WWI.
They were supposed to hold onto it for safekeeping but refused to return it after the war, and to this day they still refuse to pay anything back.
It had an appropriate value of about $10 billion by today's market standards.
