The CBO’s black-box model is bullshit, and their need to calculate things in profit/losses is detrimental to society.
I’m honestly not sure they’ve ever been correct, in hindsight, in their assessments.
In fact, a lot of their findings seem to conveniently line up with “truths” that are derived from, what we now know to be, bullshit economics.
If we’re ever going to move beyond “trickle-down” economic ideas, we’re going to have to come to the understanding that good economic decisions might cost money, because some things are worth taking “financial” “losses” on, for example; equality.
But government debt and deficits don’t really work like that, with “losses” or “profit”.
A governments deficit is societies surplus, that money isn’t gone, it’s out circulating, doing things (in healthy economies) and again, there are more important things for a healthy society than the the “profit” of government investments…like;, people having access to affordable healthcare, homes, education, roads, equality in all aspects of life (especially financial), and ensuring that businesses don’t destroy the only habitable planet we have access to.
We shouldn’t put a price tag in those things.
Economics is all made up.
We’ve bound ourselves to rules that we could just as easily toss out the window.
The current form of the system only benefits a few.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
