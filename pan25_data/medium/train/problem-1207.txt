I think its just a shared interest in authoritarianism that bring these kinds of people together.
I mean if you are the kind of unstable petty lunatic that regularly imprisons, screws over, and kills your own people the moment they disagree with you than you will likely search for individuals that do the same thing.
They both fear their own people and expect them to obey their decrees unquestioningly, regardless of how absurd or oppressive those may be.
They'll also both imprison and or execute those who don't.
An alternative oil market wouldn’t do anything to the stability of the dollar.
There’s trillions of usd in transactions taking place everyday globally that make the oil market look insignificant.
China's looking to build an alternate oil market based on the Chinese Yuan.
A large part of the stability of the US dollars is OPEC deciding to trade oil in US Dollars, so China setting up the reinforcement to its currency is a method of reinforcing their currency and just competing with American commercial dominance.
So China, Russia, Iran, Venezuela could all potentially sell into this alternate market, which in turn helps secure a reliable source of oil and other Fossil fuels imports.
China also doesn't care about the internal idiology of any nation.
Their policy which is echoed by Putin, is that what a nation does inside its borders is its own business.
Genocides aren't worth talking about.
So China will trade with nations so long as they don't tell China what to do.
