For all intents and purposes, the 1948 Nakba was a genocide of Palestinians, or at the very least an ethnic cleansing.
Yet, sadly, very few dare to call it as such, despite it bearing the hallmarks of such a definition; it was deliberate, and it intended to destroy the Palestinian Arab ethnicity in part or in whole by expelling them from their homes and destroying hundreds of their villages and towns, leading to the shattering of their society.
This lead to the creation of permanent Palestinian refugees with no right of returning to their homes.
Did the scene in question happen as portrayed or is this fiction presented under the guise of based on true events?
I looked online and couldn't find anything regarding whether the scene in the movie actually happened, but just that this is based on a true story.
A lot of Palestinians were murdered during the Nabka, so you might have a hard time saying "this is 100% how this particular family was murdered", but make no mistake the Nabka was a horrible, deadly thing.
