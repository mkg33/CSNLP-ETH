You could overwrite their religious beliefs and simultaneously pump information into their brain that makes them estatic about dying.
“While animals feed in their stalls, men and women in our world, in their hunger for wealth and power, consume even their neighbors, their brothers and sisters,” the pontiff lamented.

People only believe the religious stuff because it was programmed into them from external sources.
There is no doubt that there is a reliable way to overwrite these types of beliefs and we should be able to develop chatGPT like bots that can figure out what inputs would be necessary to break these people free from the nonsense.
People don't have autonomy of thought.
Freedom is an illusion.
Humans are born as clean slates and information is programmed into them over time.
Their behaviors emerge from what is programmed into them.
