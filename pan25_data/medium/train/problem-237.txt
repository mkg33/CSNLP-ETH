Also American here.
Trying to figure some people thinking.
Let’s say Russia was doing the same as what we had been doing for years in Ukraine in Canada would we do any different.
If you don’t think we would then look at what we are doing in Syria right now.
I’m not for the war funding and government spending.
US has given 100 to 1 than other countries to Ukraine and I honestly don’t believe we know the whole narrative of what’s actually going on there.
There seems to be an accountability problem, however.
If it were up to me, we'd dust off a thousand Abrams and a couple of hundred F-16's and send them along with ATACM's and Warthogs, but the problem is that once weapons cross the border into Ukraine it is difficult to know exactly where they end up.
I think the US should give them everything they need to make the war simply too costly for Russia, but I don’t see how the US can legitimately give them all the tools they need to win.
What tools can ‘win’ war against a country that could, if desperate, use nuclear arms?
The answer, I think, is deterrent nuclear arms, which the US obviously cannot and would not give Ukraine.
They have proved themselves to be smart, technical, inventive, highly motivated, and brave.
They do not expect the US to fight their war for them.
We only need to give them the tools.
So let’s give them those tools and let them finish this job.
