Federal student debt is not a congressional appropriation, it is a federally managed system overseen by the Department of Education (under the management of the executive branch).
For years the federal student loan program has run at a profit and has not needed federal funds from Congress.
Furthermore the bills, passed by Congress and signed by previous presidents, which brought the program into existence, gave the President sole authority over the management of the program and its assets.
If Congress would like to change that, to make the student loan program something that they manage the purse strings of, then they can pass a bill and see if Biden will sign it.
