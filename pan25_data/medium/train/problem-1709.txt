.... 30.2F isn't summer weather for a large part of the globe.
Like seriously you can just Google the Temps in the arctic and realize that it's warmer than freezing during the summer, Antarctica is colder but it still averages above freezing.
There was this video game I played where every time I destroyed an enemy base, this propaganda radio would come on air and announce that it was a planned demolition, or that it was done to preserve the area's natural environment or something.
Don't exactly remember what game though, Just Cause 3 maybe?
I didn't say most of the world, I said much of the world.
Much of Europe, North America, Asia and even South America experience sub-zero temperatures.
But that's irrelevant, my original comment was in response to this:
You made that comment when it was -1C/30F.
Considering it's going to be -21C/-6F in the Belgorod region and parts of Ukraine this weekend where people have no power and will be freezing to death, that comment is incredibly ignorant.
That's what I was pointing out with my initial response.
Maybe don't comment about things you don't understand.
