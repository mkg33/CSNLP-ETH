As a nay sayer to debt relief myself.
I didnt choose college, because of the price tag.
But also had to go into debt for other priorities at the same time in my life.
And continue to be in debt, cause the ball keeps rolling.
No one is giving me a hand out, or giving me the time back to redo my decision.
No one is putting a price tag on the choice not given by the loans.
Im sure there is alot like me, who wish they could have, couldnt, and had to accept the alternative path.
Then you bail out the could have's, who chose to.
I can however get behind the, being able to file bankruptcy on the student loans.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
