MSM: "ZELENSKYY DECLARES THAT THE WAR CAN ONLY END IF PUTIN GETS EXECUTED, OFFERS 3 BILLION DOLLAR BOUNTY ON HIS HEAD.
COMPLETE RUSSIAN TROOP WITHDRAWALS + RETURN TO 1991 BORDERS + PAY FOR DAMAGES WOULDN'T END THE WAR.
ONLY PUTIN'S HEAD SERVED DIRECTLY TO HIM WITH TARTAR SAUCE AND BRUSSELS SPROUTS WOULD SATISFY HIS THIRST FOR BLOOD.

Who posted it here and why is what I find interesting.
Whatâ€™s up u/akosipops?
Do you actually read the articles you post?
There are no words which could adequately express how much I fucking hate MSM and their grubby tactics.
Not that I disagree in general but is ibtimes mainstream media?
Like I guess any online rag qualifies.
Some of them were created just to relieve the burden of pesky journalistic standards.
It's certainly not in the same league as the news giants we all know, but I definitely wouldn't call it just an online rag.
Its revenues in 2013 were $21 million and its headquarters are on Hanover Square, Manhattan.
Wiki page says it is one of the world's largest online news sources, receiving 40 million unique visitors each month.
I wouldn't hold a tabloid to journalistic standards but these asshats sell themselves as an actual credible serious news source.
But you know, even CNN/FOX/NBC/etc pull this sort of shit sometimes.
It's despicable.
