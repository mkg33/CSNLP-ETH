As a matter of fact, it seems that cooperation and even potential membership with NATO is the only thing that helps ensure Moldovaâ€™s security.
Just like with the invasion of Ukraine, and the subsequent entrance of Sweden and Finland into NATO.
Russia continues doing more to further our own interests than we do, yet they cry and shit their pants when the opposite of what they wanted happens.
This is right up there with "Navalny poisoned himself to make Putin look bad".
Good job You just won the "laughing stock of 2022" prize.
I bet you are going for the 2023 prize too.
Funny how that works.
You complain about NATO expansion but nobody ever stopped to ask why these countries felt a need to join the alliance in the first place.
I spent a year stationed in Europe.
Many of these people, especially in Northern and Eastern Europe are extremely anxious about the future and terrified of what Russia might do.
Many of them remember the days of the Soviet Union (or they just pay the fuck attention to current events) and they want NATO there even more than we wanted to be there.
