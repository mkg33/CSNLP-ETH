Funny how they probably did this because EU cut their funding on the basis Hungary is no longer a democracy, bet Hungary dont understand this wont unfreeze their funding, by doing this they are digging themselves deeper.
My question is: Why is there no solid plan on dealing with Orban & Hungary in regards to their stance on the war?
Turkey with NATO & Hungary with the EU...
And with Hungary acting this way, I'm starting to lose faith in the idea that Sweden and Finland will ever get in.
The Orban government will probably sit on that decision for fucking years.
NATO has frequently had differing stances on how (or even whether) they should intervene in foreign wars.
How is that a bad thing, especially since this has nothing to do with the NATO charter?
You had reactionaries who questioned whether France should be in NATO when they opposed US intervention in Vietnam.
Same with Iraq in 2002.
NATO is a defensive alliance.
Orban and Erdogan are anathema to Western ideals, but they both are important to collective defense for different reasons - and support for non-member countries and embracing democracy and rule of law have nothing to do with their impact.
Except, in 2002, the president of France wasn't openly promoting global fascism alongside Saddam Hussein, in the way that Orban does with Putin.
It is different, at the very least, in that respect.
