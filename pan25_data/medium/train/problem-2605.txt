But why?
He must know USA is just toying with Russia, if NATO wanted to end the war, they could do it in a matter of weeks.
Instead they support Ukraine just enough to slowly squeeze every drop of sweat and blood from Russia, so that the war ends by russia being completele destroyed.
Does Putin really believe he can keep any of the ukraine territory?
He will lose everything incluring Crimea.
I didnt mean to invade russia directly, that would definitely set off a nuclear exchange, but destroying everything russian in ukraine and the black sea.
One other thing also confuses me, how would russia defend itself against either outside invading forces or inside civil war?
Like countries like Kazakhstan, Georgie, North Korea or even China could start anexing parts of russia and Putin would be powerless against it.
Or local parta of russia at the borders could break out and start their own countries.
Putin put 100% of his forces to ukraine and he is relying on the fact that he is the only ashole on the planet actually disrupting official state borders.
NATO cant invade russia due to nuclear weapons, but what would putin do if Georgie annexed a piece of russia?
or if china annexed the east part of russia where they have been stealing lumber for decades?
It is almost funny how russia knows they are the only bad guys on the planet and yet it doesnt stop them, it encourages them.
If Mongols were still a thing, Mongolie would be the largest country by now.
Unfortunately they will also squeeze every dollar they can out of Ukraine and there will be alot of foreign debt incurred.
Hopefuly all the seized russia assets, including the half a billion dollars of bank assets, will go towards reparations for ukraine.
It would actually be almost enough, I read estimates that ukraine will need 800-1000 billion dollars to recover from the war, and I REALLY hope that EU is not planning to pay it off by themselves.
Russia will never agree to pay that, so we just have to take it.
