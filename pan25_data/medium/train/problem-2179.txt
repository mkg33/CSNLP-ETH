Every day we find more evidence that early man was a lot more coordinated and intelligent than we typically give them credit for.
This is a great discovery.
If there was, we almost certainly would have found traces of it by now.
The growth of ancient Roman civilization (and the environmental effects resulting from that growth) can be tracked through glacial ice in Greenland, so it would be even more conspicuous if there was residual evidence of a large, relatively advanced civilization that existed during a period before such civilizations were supposed to have emerged.
It might be possible if a civilization used resources (particularly energy) in a way and/or from a source that’s so alien to us that we can’t recognize any patterns in the archeological record that would identify it as human activity, but that’s veering into ancient aliens territory.
Yeah the most that I can imagine would be one off , small, fairly isolated societies having a brief golden age before being wiped out by rising sea levels and the ensuing chaos that goes with it.
Humans have been around for a long time, and modern cities are relatively new.
Would be possible that society had a few trial runs before becoming an established practise.
