You're right, we should just appease Russia the way we should have just appeased Germany to prevent wwii.
I'm sure a russo-sino superpower spanning from poland to taiwan will treat the international community with pure benevolence and cooperation.
Well, that I told the President when I was advising him was that it was a credible enough number to give Germany coverage to send a shitload of Leopard 2s.
40 Abrams was enough to destroy 160 t72s/t55s with no losses in Iraq.
50 is more than enough to take out a whatever Russia has left in southern Ukraine.
Yes, but are they getting the Abrahams fully kitted out or they get the shitty watered down export versions.
Is one thing the American military versions that have all those juicy classified tech enhancements VS the stripped down versions with none of those enhancements like the optics, electronics and better armor.
I seriously doubt the US will send stuff that contains military secrets, therefore Ukraine will probably get the not-as-effective Abrahams.
