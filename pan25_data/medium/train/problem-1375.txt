100,000 people attended a pro-democracy protest in Tel Aviv yesterday (in a nation of less than 10M).
Polls show that a majority of Israelis oppose the coalitions moves to neuter the high court.
I really hope Israelis can nip this fascism in the bud.
This fascism has been accelerating ever since emperor Netanyahu took over again in 2009.
They're going to keep on trying and keep on pushing the envelope until it succeeds, just like they did in Hungary, just like they did in Poland, just like they're doing in the US.
I have really lost any hope of my country ever being able to prevent this, let alone by mere protests.
Time for Israel to join the rest of the middle east in an authoritarian theocracy.
In some of them, the uncertain group is the biggest, in others the one for change is the biggest - depends where it was asked.
That's without calling the BS that it's "pro-democracy" protest.
It was a political one because many in the left are worried about losing their beneficial dictatorship power that is called the supreme court of Israel.
The most powerful supreme court that exists in a democratic nation.
One that has shown times and times again that it works according to its own agendas and not according to its laws.
One that showed that he will care more about people from the left than the right.
Where was he when underage girls that wanted to block Ayalon road, where in police custody for months (just like left-protestors tried a few days ago but no one did shit to them)?
Where was he when right-wing protestors got bitten up in 2005?
He only truly cared about people from the left.
