And people are acting as if that's a new thing.
For those unaware, 1978 WC took place in Argentyna, during the regime of Jorge Videla.
He became the de facto president thru the violent coup on 1976, was known to kill his political oponents and kidnaping babies while keeping their mothers in prison yet FIFA saw no problems with letting that country organised the WC with a couple of shady reffeering decision on favour of Argentina during the tournament which they ended up winning.
And its not like people were unaware of what's happening there, backlash was strong enough that one of the best footballers at that time, Johan Cruyff, decided against going there even tho Netherlands were considered one of the favourites to win the whole thing (and even without him they reached the finał).
It’s funny though, the whole point is to showcase your country as a modern, cool place worth visiting even after the cup.
People were prepared to look past the human rights violations, but then you take their beer and now everything else is back in the spotlight.
The leaders couldn’t fake western norms for even a few weeks.
