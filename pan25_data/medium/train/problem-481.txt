Wow, her wikipedia entry is extremely sad.
That poor woman, she suffered endless abuse.
She got screwed by everybody who should have helped her.
So sad.
Norwegians do the same thing.
They beat the shit out of me, held me in solitary confinement for 36 hours and kicked me of their country for pointing out that they use refugees displaced by war to create bombs that are used against their own people, creating an endless loop of destruction and moral depravity.
The Japanese criminal legal system is kinda fucked because it has something like a 99% conviction rate.
They’ll drop charges for just about anything they can’t guarantee will result in a guilty verdict, but if they are sure they can falsely charge someone and get a guilty verdict they’ve done that too.
Here's the thing, that not exactly your choice, theychave really fucked up laws around interrogation.
I don't remember the exact time, but I think they can hold you up to 48 hours without a lawyer where mild assault is basically condoned and they can deprive you of sleep.
This probably isn't the average experience, but not without precedent.
