As for the rest of the comment, it’s pretty much a paraphrase of what an Indian responded to me a couple days ago, claiming India and Hindus had nothing to do with the partition violence and were ruthlessly attacked by Pakistan.
Anything that breaks the narrative i hear Indian nationalists spew everywhere that the poor Hindu Indians were viciously attacked, unprovoked, by the radical Islamists demanding Pakistan and indpendence would be upsetting to Modi and his voting base.
The fact that you read a headline about declassification of documents and immediately jumped to "Indian nationalists" and "upsetting to Modi" with no further information is telling of your bias especially since the recommendation to keep it confidential is mentioned in the article as having been made in 1970, well before BJP even existed, and when India was still under Congress rule.
This is an article about the current government considering whether to declassify those documents, not the 1970’s government’s decision closer to the event.
It mentions that in 2021 the documents were recommended to be published, but Modi’s government has not.
