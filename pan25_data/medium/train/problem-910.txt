You can pretty much draw a line from Montana to Missouri via the current upper level prevailing winds.
Depending on the part of Missouri you're in, you could calculate the balloon's speed.
According to windy.com, the winds at like 45,000 feet are 40-80 mph right now.
"Capability to maneuver" for a balloon is "go up and down" to try and catch wind in the direction you want to travel.
Fairly straightforward to design, and anything else is ineffective.
This thing isn't pushing itself around with thrust.
Oh god I hope it makes it down to Texas.
I would love seeing all the YouTube videos full of Texans loud-talking to the camera, being like, “I have finished setting up my homemade, solid fuel rocket that I’ve loaded up with 50 pounds of tannerite and strapped with three separate AR-15s—for redundancy.
And it’s also equipped with five separate GoPros so we can see aaaaaall that communist tyranny being destroyed!”.
Yeah literally saw a Reddit post a bit ago that was basically “NORAD has been tracking the Chinese spy satellite since it was in China’s mainland.
Here’s the entire path it took.”.
