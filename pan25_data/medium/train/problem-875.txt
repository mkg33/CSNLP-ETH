soledar might not be the most defensible position from a zerg-type assault, but it's an extremely shellable position from the west of bakhmut.
hopefully wagner decides to build another hotel there, because the UA arty is going to have a field day.
Rift or not the fact is Russia's made significant gains in the area.
I don't know if they just threw men at Ukraine's trenches to win or hopefully Ukraine let them take ground that was no longer defensible.
But what I think happened is Russia overwhelmed the troops in soledar and either pushed threw tactically or through sheer force.
Either way it's a big loss for Ukraine and hopefully one they can counter attack.
According to reports they used prisoners as literal bullet sponges.
This is a winter offensive and they have paid a much higher price for it than they should have.
This also is not a "big loss" for Ukraine.
When I started to think about this a bit more clearly I realized, of course Russia will win a few battles in an actual war.
This is part of Russia's still failing objective of capturing nearby bahkmut which they've also been getting mauled at.
