The Kentucky state legislature is pretty goddamn awful actually, as was the governor's office under Matt Bevin.
A lot of us love Andy Beshear and think he's done a great job but the fact is he only got elected because Bevin made it his personal mission to piss off literally anyone he could in the year leading up to the election, and Daniel Cameron is probably going to end up surviving the insane 14 person GOP primary to challenge him and would be favored to win.
Honestly the only thing I find objectionable about this bill is that the tax credit should be limited to the percentage of your tax bill that corresponds to the percentage of money the state spends on education overall.
In other words, this shouldn't come at the expense of the state's effort to raise revenue for repairing roads, funding welfare programs, etc.
Still a great sign that the KY Supreme Court shot this down unanimously though, as they should have.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
KY has some of the worst public education in the US (can confirm, from KY) so it’s not like it can get much worse.
Without looking I’m sure they’re not dead last, but they probably really don’t want to sink 3 or 4 places down And push Arkansas and Mississippi up above them.
