There was a really good article about an interview where the Ukrainian pilots themselves estimated 3 months for operational training.
Training isn’t a terribly large deal for the pilots.
It’s also all the additional work and logistics for ground crews.
The Iron Dome currently protects a tiny country against primitive rockets.
Creating a system that can protect a country as big as Ukraine from modern, sophisticated missiles and drones is a much more difficult and expensive task.
If you watch the press report with Zelensky and Biden, his main reasoning is fear of perceived escalation and the concerns of countries in Nato.
I’m sure Biden would love to give them aging f-18s or another option but countries in Nato closer to Russia would likely heavily object for fear of retaliation.
A bigger problem with giving them American jets (F-) is that the Ukrainian pilots are not trained on them.
They are used to the Migs, so past Soviet countries hand over their old Migs in exchange for replenished American ones.
