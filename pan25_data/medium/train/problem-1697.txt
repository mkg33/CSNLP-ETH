Sitting in a room full of Argentinians.
Roller coaster is an apt description.
I think one of the guys was on the ground having some heart pain after Mbappe tied the game back up.
Im a white guy who doesn’t really follow soccer but my roommate and his argentina family are all here watching the game and i almost shed a tear after they won and i saw how happy they were.
That was the best comment of the game lol and I was right there with him I have never yelled at the TV so much omg I felt like I was having a heart attack.
I wasn’t rooting for Messi but it was a great match .
I was yelling so loud that my husband- who yells like a banshee when the Cowboys are playing- told me to “calm down.” LPT- the only time it’s okay to tell your wife to “calm down” is when she is watching the WC final and only because she will be too engrossed in the game to pay any attention to what you just said lol.
Incredible game, not happy it went to penalties but oh well.
I’m happy Messi got his World Cup in his last international game ever and broke the World Cup record for goals scored all time.
France still has crazy young talent and will be a huge force in 2026.
Hopefully Mbappe can chase Messi’s record!
Ya I was mistaken.
I watched the whole thing in Spanish and I am definitely not fluent.
Idk why they started talking about a broken record right after he scored the first pk.
