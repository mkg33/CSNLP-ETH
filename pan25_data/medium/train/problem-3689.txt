The problem is that looking at that agreement through a Russian lens it is useless because Russia never intends to actually comply.
If Russia says 'we won't attack' they are already planning to attack, so when someone tells Russian 'we won't attack' then Russia assumes they are lying and are going to attack.
If you can't keep up economically (and you desire to) then you change financial policies and invest in your own country to make that happen.
The point of garantuees is that they are revoked if the treaty is broken.
The intend is that they get depended on the garantuees and don’t do shut.
Russia even stated at the beginning that they felt that (not verbatim) „the west has let them down and betrayed them over the last decade or so“.
Must not be true but that’s what they said at least.
I don’t think it’s unreasonable to assume that Russia feels like they can’t keep up economically with the rest.
What you DON'T do is try and steal and bring down everyone else's economy instead to lower them down to your level.
