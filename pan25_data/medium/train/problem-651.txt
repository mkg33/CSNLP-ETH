I'm so on the fence about it.
I loved CK3 and love strategy games, but everything before CK3 was a little too much; and trust me, I tried to learn CK2, HOI4, Vic2, Stellaris.
None of my friends play Vic3 and I don't trust steam reviews anymore.
Would you be willing to give me your thoughts?
Note that hoi4 got heaps more complicated after more dlcs and more demands from the players to include this and that aspect of war.
Personally the focus on micro got boring so even more of it turned me off completely.
It plays totally differently than CK3.
CK3 is more about characters and role-playing.
In Vicky, you are trying to steer a nation-state through being industrialized in a game that is centered around socio-economics.
It is more approachable than older paradox games, but it’s closer to its imperator/EU4 cousins than CK3.
Some people are into that others aren’t.
If you’re on the fence, I would wait for a sale or a good dlc.
I like it, I never played Vic 2 or any of the CK franchise.
Im moving over from HoI 4.
I am loving the market based system.
There are lots of bugs and complaints from the vets but its a fun civ builder with lots of diplomatic options, a longish tech tree and a great government system for passing laws.
Ck3, and hoi4 before it, mark considerable efforts to make the games more approachable to newcomers.
I haven't tried vic3 but I suspect it follows that philosophy.
