Ethics hearing not a trial.
Terminology is different.
Currently, the ethics group is determining if (though not hard for most of us to see) he violated ethics rules while acting as an attorney.
If they find that he did, they can disbar him.
It will be up to a prosecutor to determine if he committed a crime (and in what jurisdiction) if he was outside his capacity as an attorney.
Like it or not, those who pass the bar and have been sworn in as an officer of the court are given more leeway than you or I.
However, IANAL, so take all that with a grain of salt.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
