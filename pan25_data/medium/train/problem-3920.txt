“Pegasus is spyware developed by the Israeli cyber-arms company NSO Group that can be covertly installed on mobile phones (and other devices) running most versions of iOS and Android.
Pegasus is able to exploit iOS versions up to 14.7, through a zero-click exploit.
As of 2022, Pegasus was capable of reading text messages, tracking calls, collecting passwords, location tracking, accessing the target device's microphone and camera, and harvesting information from apps.
The spyware is named after Pegasus, the winged horse of Greek mythology.
It is a Trojan horse computer virus that can be sent "flying through the air" to infect cell phones.” ).
I know this but it’s not right and will continue to point it out every chance I get.
It shouldn’t be a right to privacy in name only.
Back before the US found out about CIA and FBI mail opening operation James Jesus Angleton knew if the citizens found out about it they’d be pissed and here we are where people excuse it.
I totally get why people would argue against this, but it isn’t always going to be in justified ways.
If the US were to allow it, or any country, what’s to stop that country’s leadership from using it on their opposition?
If a criminal holding your loved one hostage in an unknown place and it's possible to track his location and rescue your loved one with the power of technology, would you say "no , we can't!
His right to privacy is very important" or will you say " Track this madafaka down"?
