Jews didn't own as much land because historically in the Ottoman empire they were not allowed to.
Most of the land was uninhabited, so your comment makes it seem like Arabs owned 93% which is not true.
On top of that, the land is not comparable, most of the land given to Israel was a mostly uninhabited desert, the Arabs were given most of the farmable land.
The only people minus a few small outpost in the Negev were Bedouins, who largely still live there(others were kicked out of Gaza by Hamas), one thing it did give Israel was access to the Red Sea, which they would not have been able to survive as a country with out.
I find it really diingenous to hear people talking about the division of land, without them understanding anything about the land, not all land is equal and most of the land Israel got was pretty terrible.
It's not much different to when Republicans show maps of America and say, "look more land votes Republican".
This is a completely incorrect view of the situation in general, in this specific case it is even more wrong.
The person kidnapped was not Jewish, he was Druze.
His family was there when it happened, they say he was still alive and on life support, meaning they disconnect him and killed him in the process of kidnapping him.
