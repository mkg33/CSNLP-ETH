Don’t say that, republicans would actually love a reason to say “pregnant women cannot work,” because it would further trap women to their abusers (in such cases).
If you’re pregnant can the foetus claim a wage?
As a person they’re being forced into child labour through their mother’s work?
So, it stands to reason we either make it legal or we force women to take time off the moment the foetus is present.

It’s a trap.
When you start doing things like claiming a fetus on taxes and the like, you legitimize their position and “admit” that fetuses are people.
