Today was yet another pretty quiet day with no missile strikes or drones and with only a single air raid alert throughout the entire day.
That alert wasn’t that long ago either, it happened at 12:15am, there were no missile launches from Belgorod, but some explosions were reported in Kupiansk around the same time.
Kupiansk is still well within the range of Russian artillery, so they will definitely continue shelling it until they are pushed back far enough.
The Russian side of the border also continues to get shelled by our forces pretty much every day.
Today we had reports of Shebekino being shelled yet again.
Apparently this time we took down their electricity there, as they were reporting blackouts right after shelling.
That town sure does get hit a lot.
Not that long ago, during one of the massive missile strikes on our infrastructure they actually landed some of their missiles in the streets of Shebekino, killing some of their own civilians in the process.
I guess Russians really don’t care about their own people even a little bit, but somehow that doesn’t stop their civilians from completely supporting the war anyway.
Are they just a nation of masochists?
Glad it has been relatively calm, but it’s disturbing to think that it could escalate even further again.
I am sorry.
Indeed.
Someone had made a map of Mariupol on google maps.
He put photos of buildings that were destroyed on their place on the map.
The majority of the streets have photos of destroyed buildings.
(Edit: the map is in this article ).
On a different note, as you described, it’s wild how Russia accidentally bombed their own people.
Mistakes happen, but it sounds like Russia makes a lot of them (of course, let’s not forget that many of the things Russia does are also intentionally evil).
To me, this Russian fatal friendly fire says a lot about both Russia’s priorities and the skill of their military.
Ugh.
