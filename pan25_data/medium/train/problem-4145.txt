Not to mention the wounded on top of that.
That's always a bigger number.
Dead or in the hospital, that's lost manpower either way.
And not every wounded soldier will be fit to return to duty.
Not to mention that's an even bigger drain on society.
Dead people don't cost you anything at that point.
Wounded soldiers cost until they eventually die.
Forget to take the safety off, accidentally drop your rifle, run away from millions of dollars of assault vehicles.
That sort of thing.
Hit by multiple anti tank munitions, such as the javelin?
You're a big target, and clearly being targeted.
Bailing and fleeing on foot might still risk bullets and shrapnel, but maybe you stop being a priority 1 target.
I imagine that once you've been engaged, flooring it for 10 seconds isn't going to get you out of range, so if you're fearing a lock on missile, I can see where they might opt to spend those seconds climbing out.
Just an extrapolation of the same battlefield mentality.
Why are mines designed to maim and not kill?
A dead body can be picked up later.
I wounded soldier needs to be evacuated and that likely takes three people in addition to get him out of there.
So now you're removed for soldiers from the battlefield instead of just one.
