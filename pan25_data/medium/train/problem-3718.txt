I have an acquaintance who joined up with a small city’s police force because he wanted to do some good and make a difference.
He’s a good guy, but he’s also seen some terrible, terrible things.
He has stories he can tell that come out like the darkest of dark comedies, but I also know there are cases he doesn’t talk about, cases that involve rapists, pedophiles and abuse that I think most of us are fortunate enough not to have experienced.
And he basically has to confront these people on a regular basis.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
