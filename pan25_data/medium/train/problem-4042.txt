While it is also certainly about easy optics for the domestic Chinese audience, these new demands for testing are a direct acknowledgement of how bad the COVID situation in China is.
To not protest would be to tacitly acknowledge this fact, which Xi refuses to do.
Bunch of fucking spiteful children running the CCP.
We're they not restricting and ceasing people entering China at one stage.
Did they not admit they had a huge surge in cases and maybe a new strain.
Did they not lock down their citizens in the harshest ways.
They still don't issue tourist visas and still have quarantine for all arrivals, but they apply it for everyone, so that's not exactly comparable.
What China is protesting is that they are singled out.
