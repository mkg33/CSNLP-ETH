That would be a shame, since Borderlands is one of my favourite franchises.
I’ve been playing it since the first and have bought several copies for myself and as gifts over the years.
The EPIC games store is the worst.
I bought Borderlands 3 through their store and I deeply regret it.
Im trying to get a refund since I only played a few hours.
Im never purchasing another game through their store, and if they don’t give me a refund so I can transfer my license to Steam I’m never buying a game from them ever again.
Epic is gonna spend who knows how many millions getting their app onto the Android Play store only for it to be as successful as their PC store, which doesn't even have the excuse of an anticompetitive OS preventing its installation to justify its lack of success.
