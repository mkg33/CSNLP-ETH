Russia has the audacity to try to execute foreign volunteers as ‘mercenaries’ while happily using one of the largest, and most despicable, private armies in the world.
Those who are Russian nationals are considered lawful combatants, the Geneva Conventions make an exception...

PMCs aren't even legal in Russia, that's the worst part.
They're funded and supported by the Russian government.
They might as well be another branch of the MoD.
Not really.
It's still, more or less, an explosion, and in fact may look more like the explosions you see in movies than most actual, high explosive weapons - by design they're more fireball-ish.
Think of it sort of like shooting a propane tank - it's just fuel and no oxidizer, then it mixes with the air and ignites, making a big explodey ball of fire.
They do have a legitimate military use, in that they're a lot better at destroying structures than normal high explosives because they create a much longer pressure wave, and you get more considerably bang per pound of warhead (since you're only firing the fuel and not oxidizer with it).
On the other hand, they're hell for people - you get burned, generally inside and out because you inhaled the fuel/air mixture, and you get all sorts of nasty pressure-wave caused internal injuries that don't kill all that quickly.
Oh, and the fuels typically used are also highly toxic, so there's that, too.
As an accurate, squad-level bunker buster weapon, they're not completely unthinkable.
As an area saturation, heavy unguided rocket weapon (ie, TOS-1A), yeah, they're pretty fucking awful.
