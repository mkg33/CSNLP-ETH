My biggest concern about the environment is the toll it will take on humanity, the lives lost and made worse by the catastrophe.
That said, I have a hard time looking at another humanitarian catastrophe, like the war in Ukraine, and saying "Well, if a few million Ukrainians die from being unarmed and unprotected, that's still a pretty small price to pay on the chance that we could save billions of lives down the line, assuming Russia doesn't keep pressing into Europe, in which case the net lives saved from not having a standing military will be somewhat smaller.
".
