To use an oversimplified example, if Canada donated 20 artillery pieces and the USA donated 100, then obviously the USA's donation is worth far more money.
However, if Canada only had 50 of those artillery pieces to begin with while the USA had 2000, then it could be argued that Canada's donation represented a larger investment, as they gave up 40% of their own artillery capacity to arm Ukraine, whereas the 100 units given by the USA would only be 5% of what they had on hand.
To Canada, those 20 would be worth more than 100 would be to the USA, particularly when a lot of the equipment can't be quickly replaced due to producers' finite manufacturing capacity.
The US’s entire military budget for the past 70 years has been focused on defeating Russia and destroying Russia’s ability to wage war.
The war in Ukraine has seen that budget do exactly what it was made for, and without American lives being lost to do so.
Anyone who claims this money is not worth it is an out and out idiot.
This is exactly what this giant defense budget has always been for.
