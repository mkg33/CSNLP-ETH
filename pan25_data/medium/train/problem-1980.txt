Oh shut up, they are still one of the strongest on the planet.
Still in the top 10 compared to all others on an individual basis (which just shows how bad most militaries are).
Attitudes like yours will just cause Ukraine to be overconfident and lose more lives than necessary.
You can't honestly believe your second paragraph is based on any objective truth, surely not.
You're telling us that the UKR make up their strategy based on Reddit comments?
Mate they have been having major victories but they have constantly said there is more fighting to be done.
So either your reading shit news reports or your misconstruing what the Ukrainian military has been saying.
I had an issue with you saying "If their announcements were all legit they would have won by now."
because this is straight up bullshit.
It's not based on any objective truth, any perceived reality, it's a throwaway comment with no merit.
No evidence to back up the statement.
It's hypothetical but not a description of what is really the truth.
I guess it was badly worded and wasn't meant to represent reality.
