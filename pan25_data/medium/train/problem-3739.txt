I think the only challenge on the coast is a few are tourist towns (or recovering tourist towns) that have difficulty eeking out a living in between seasons.
The fishing towns have the bounty of both constant (if grueling) work so they're the more established coastal cities.
Okay, since you’re making a pitch for the PNW I hope you don’t mind me asking—coastal Oregon, what’s the catch?
I’ve lived in rural Iowa my entire life and I’ve been eyeing a move to somewhere roughly between like Coo’s Bay to Newport.
The weather seems perfect, like it never gets too hot or too cold.
Too far north for earthquakes (seems like it’s also too far north for most of the wildfires too but I could be wrong,) too far south for the nasty winters, wrong ocean for any of the ocean-related natural disasters, cost of living seems relatively doable, low crime rates, pretty good schools, etc.
Is this some sort of undiscovered utopia or am I missing something?
