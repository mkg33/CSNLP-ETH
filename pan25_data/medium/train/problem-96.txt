Yesterday’s Ramstein meeting was honestly pretty weird.
It’s understandable that most of the discussions stayed behind the closed doors and not revealed to public, but because of how little of anything was said most media already declared the meeting a failure, and said that no tanks will be delivered.
But then our defense minister said that our forces will be starting training on Leopards very soon, which almost certainly means that we will be getting them in the end.
So why make a scene out of it in the first place by saying the opposite of the truth?
Making it look like there are disagreements between allies when there are none doesn’t really help anyone.
Well, there are obviously some disagreements, but this makes it look like much worse than it really is for no reason.
The funny thing is that even if they did destroy an M1, which could happen because war, the fact that they'd make such a huge deal about it really makes them look pathetic and desperate.
Their entire fleet of tanks is in ruin and that's in real life.
