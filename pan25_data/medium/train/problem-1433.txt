It's funny seeing how much propaganda over in Spain has begun aligning with the GQP propaganda.
It's like "Hey, Spaniard, do wish to kick yourself in the head and like it?"
"Yes, yes I do" "Well, here you are".
There's this social media website in Spain which was even promoting a Tucker Carlson interview.
actually on a whole other level than what we have in America right now.
Of course we have bribery and corruption, but it really isn't that same at all.
I can't for instance, generally speaking bribe my way out of jail.
Rich people of course can hire expensive lawyers for that, but it isn't expected that should I get caught in a sweep that I should pay a sum to the cop to make this go whole thing go away.
I don't bribe the lady at the DMV to get a driver's license, or a pilot's license for an airline for that matter.
Or a cush government job.
Its global.
My wife's Thai friends spout all sorts of anti Ukraine nonsense.
"Did you know there's corruption in Ukraine?"
Yeah, no shit.
There's corruption in your country, my country , every country.
That doesn't mean you support Russia...ever.
Fuck Russia.
From the country that taught me a new word: baksheesh.
I can’t believe in Thailand bribery is so normalized they don’t even see it as corruption anymore.
It’s just the thing you do to get stuff done, or undone, as the case may be.
There is bribery in government in my city, but it isn't an accepted part of day-to-day life for all people big and small.
