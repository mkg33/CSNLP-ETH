100% agree... Look I get business and brodeals...
But when you become an elected official and you take a position of responsibility abusing that for your own financial gain before during or after that fact is garbage...
If we don't seriously prosecute that s and put some controls on it... We rot from the inside out.
A few years ago the head of the SFO in an interview said they only had the budget to handle ONE large case per-year.
The budget of the Serious Fraud Office - who are tasked with investigating and prosecuting Fraud and Corruption in the UK, has fallen pretty much every single year since Thatcher's time, both under Tory and New Labour governments.
This is how there is oficially no corruption in Britain: the responsability for going after it has been placed in a single entity and then both Tory and Labour politicians cooperated to make it incapable of doing it's work so, lo and behold, there are no corrupt politicians as they're not even investigated much less prosecuted and convicted.
For me the shocker is that even when the head of the SFO very openly admited they have almost no money, there was no outrage and most britons seemed (when I was there, 4 years ago) to think there was no corruption in Britain (oh how easy it is to deceive those who want to be deceived...).
Sadly it's only something I remember hearing and reading about maybe 6-8 years ago when was still living in the UK.
It really does, it is comparable to many other grievous crimes.
Worse than many others that get taken more seriously.
I steal your car and I get rammed hard through the system.
They rob our voice/choice/consent and run for office again.
