Like if you sort by most controversial it’s posts with a large & similar number of upvotes and downvotes.
Yes but saying it is more controversial than expected implies OP thought the comments would all agree on the matter.
So the commenter is asking OP, what type of comments and sentiment did OP expect to be dominant in this thread.
I mean, I think the general opinion (true or not) is that reddit is more liberal than the US government tends to be, and you can get an X marker on your US passport.
I think banned communities swarm posts that are about their controversial topic if it pops up.
Sane people may or may not read this, but bigots will be drawn in.
That means that the opinion of adult men (all voters before the change) could have been against it and still had the change come in.
Then people over time get used to it, and come to celebrate it, as much as we idealise civil rights battles they are usually the minority forcing their (righteous) opinion on the majority who oppose it.
Whereas in Switzerland they had to accept this more through cultural osmosis before it could come law.
I could see Switzerland having a similar or slightly lower approval % of men agreeing with women’s suffrage than much of the West.
This comes from a perspective where we have universal adult citizen suffrage.
In the past governments did not see every adult citizen(/subject) as their “constituents” - in fact this would be meaningless in non-representative systems.
We have gone from heads of state only really seeing their few most wealthy citizens as “constituents” to where we are now.
In the future someone might think that it’s weird/unacceptable for us to deny suffrage to non-citizens or even that a classification such as “citizen” even exists.
Governments govern people and we’re so very changeable that you shouldn’t expect much uniformity of governments, especially through time.
