You got it exactly.
Kalingrad is a good example they didn't just occupy the city like a colony after Germany lost it in ww2 they kicked all the ethnic people living there out and replaced them with Russians completely changing the areas people and history.
They did the same to Finland after they took their land for the "buffer zone" they wanted from Saint Petersburg.
Kicked all the finish out and made Russians settle in those areas.
Russia has become really good at wiping ethnicities out and replacing it with their own.
Luhansk, Donestk and Crimea is another example of them forcing their citizen to those cities same thing happens to Georgia ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡ª.
They take land by moving their ethnic Russians in and pulling the ethinc people into Russia that's why they have taken so many Children and people from areas they invaded from Ukraine.
Russias leadership has been making a bunch of bullshit reasons to do what it's done.
It's a shame so many people eat it up like it's "reasonable" or "understandable" that he wants a buffet zone lmao don't make laugh like any dictator they want power influence and to forever keep it by any means necessary.
having similar views and starting a war are two different things, also even if his views aling almost perfect with Vladimir if someone that is not Putin get the office he will consider this one the reason of the fall of the previous government and pull out or actually start ceasefire and peacetalk to limit the backslash from the country.
