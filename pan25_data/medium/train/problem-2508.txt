Yup.
My goal was to put two Scorpion tanks in the cave, angle them correctly on that center rock, and they'd wiggle and never respawn.
From there, I'd throw some Ghosts on top, the Banshees on top, and the Warthogs underneath the tanks.
Throw in a few grenades for good measure, and they're never re-spawning .
This is just another charge of the same operation/behavior from earlier in the war.
There are complete write-ups if you look back on it.
They basically had the kids playing Pokemon Go with military equipment.
If you can find "XXX" vehicle and get a picture you get points or even real money.
Kids ate that stuff up and started walking all over areas looking for matches to the requests.
Tankies say it's brilliant, except this type of activity is extremely illegal and in total, I believe this is the sixth time a russian backed game aimed at children has been placed on markets in Ukraine.
Admittedly, if I were a grown-ass man on a cold battlefield, knowing the drones buzzing above me were piloted by a 12-year old with ADHD that loves mobile games would induce terror.
