Everyone answering with dumb jokes, typical reddit.
Thyroid cancer treatment is usually done by either surgery or radiotherapy, or radioactive iodine, rarely by chemotherapy.
Decreased thyroid function, which can result from thyroid cancer itself or any of these treatments, is usually supplemented with the thyroid hormone Levothyroxine, to make up for the lack of function.
If the supplemented levels are too high low, or supplementation is not started soon enough, a temporary condition known as Myxedema Madness has been reported to occur, which has a wide variety of mental functional impairments associated with it.
It usually doesn't last more than a week or so while your hormone levels and body response to the hormone supplements adjust.
Maybe they just use the wrong drugs?
What if we had a dictator that was high as fuck off psilocybin and decided he wanted everyone to have cotton candy instead of pay federal taxes?
The argument for this (From Duncan Trussel's The Midnight Gospel ) is that yeah it may make them a better human being OR they'd have a bad trip and order mass executions or some shizzz lol.
