That's how Putin got into power in the first place.
We need to Marshall plan the shit out of Russia once they lose, de-Putinify it and ensure Western cooperation.
I'd hate to see Russia become a puppet of China more than I'd hate for the war to "end" with some other dipshit at the wheel who's just another version of Putin.
Yeah, the Russian army is committing atrocities.
Yeah, the invasion is illegal.
Yeah, those in power who are green lighting all of this as well as those on the ground who are carrying it all out must be punished.
But if we isolate a post war russian state because of its current actions we'll just have the same damn problem we have now 20 years down the line.
China worries me far more than Russia does.
This isn’t about ukraine.
This is about strenhening China-Saudi ties, and ties with the Middle East.
This is a play to keep Russia in their back pocket (for oil and natural G’s resources in the future) and driving division with us and the Middle East.
It even says so in the article.
