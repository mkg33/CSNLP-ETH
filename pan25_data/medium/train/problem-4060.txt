I think there's definitely something to be said about cultural lineage here.
It would be weird, for example, for Turkey to request the return of the Triumphal Quadriga from Italy.
Cultures that occupy particular spaces are constantly shifting entities that are seldom tethered to the actual geographical and historical contexts of many artifacts.
Similar arguments are made about the ridiculousness of revanchism as a political position - claims of 'rightful ownership' are often made from the context of cultural affiliation of territory, often without much basis in reality or acknowledgement of shared cultural spaces.
I think the difference for Egyptian and Greek artifacts for example is that the current plundered artifacts are from a period of de facto occupation, and were taken from under the noses of what are pretty much the current inheritors of the territory.
Trying to keep this short, so I'll also add that archaeogenetics is going to crack open a whole other can of worms.
"Travelers that visited the Acropolis in the 18th century often made a point of taking a piece of the Parthenon as momentums...".
