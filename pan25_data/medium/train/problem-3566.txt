For context: Belarus is still pushing migrants from Africa to territories of Lithuania and Latvia.
Belarusian border guard literally push them physically into other countries.
At times they first take shoes from migrants too, in midst of the winter (-1 here in LT right now, not so long it was -10 and even colder).
In that light treaties on "border cooperation" sound like a standup comedy.
The problem Lukashenko has is that his population is very anti war.
They lost 25% of their population in WW2 and they have a 'never again' sentiment.
It's why he's been so reluctant to send troops already.
He's already seeing popular opposition to his dictatorship, with the military being the only safeguard against coup.
If the military are being asked to go burn itself down in Ukraine they may consider a quick bullet to the head of one man a better alternative.
I expect that, if a coup happens, there will be a backroom deal where Luka runs to a NATO country for sanctuary while the military "looks the other way".
