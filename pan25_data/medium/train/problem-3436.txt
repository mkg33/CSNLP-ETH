I live in the Philadelphia metro area.
When the first vaccine came out, I got frustrated trying to figure out how to get it around here.
The sites either didn’t work, or if they did, were offering me appointments 4 weeks out.
I didn’t want to wait that long.
So I found a state website with an interactive map, and started to click on the red dots indicating vax centers, further out in more rural PA counties.
I clicked on one that was set up in an abandoned KMart in Lebanon County and it came up with available times THAT SAME DAY.
Almost ALL of the slots were available.
I picked one, hopped in my car, and drove an hour and half.
The center had more health care workers than there were people.
In general, be courteous to others.
