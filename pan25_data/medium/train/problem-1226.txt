I'm in northern CT and it's been kind of tough listening to everyone praise the nice weather lately without considering why it's unseasonably warm.
Personally, it makes me sad when I think about why I'm sleeping with my windows wide open in November.
Never in my life of living in New England have I been able to have windows open at night in November.

Long Island guy here and after 4 days in a row of 70+ weather and listening to my friends say things like "Global warming isn't all bad", I realize too many people will never get it.
I'm like "Did you guys read what the warm water temperatures are doing to shellfish and algae, etc.?"
Of course, they do not.
Thank you, I remember when I was a kid by November in NY it was already chilly.

Same whenever I bring up the actual effects of global warming, besides the warm weather when it's usually cold.
An entire generation of elephants died in Africa because of drought.

I'm also curious how it's affecting the animals that hibernate, but I don't think I want the answer ðŸ˜•.
My other favorite response when things like more intense storms happen and cause more damage and especially flooding is "You have been screaming about global warming for years.
Now you want to blame everything on it.
The climate is always changing.
