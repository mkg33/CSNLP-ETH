KABUL — The Taliban regime, stepping up the pace and severity of Islamic punishments, carried out its first public execution this week since taking power 15 months ago.
A convicted murderer was shot Wednesday, followed a day later by the lashing of 27 men and women in a soccer stadium on charges that included adultery, theft, drug use and running away from home.
The man put to death in western Farah province was not identified, but officials said he was accused of murder five years ago and found guilty after three recent court hearings.
Under the Islamic legal tenet of “qisas,” which allows personal retribution for crimes, the father of the murder victim carried out the death sentence as a crowd watched, shooting the killer three times.
The condemnation the Taliban are receiving for having public executions is nothing compared to the condemnation the US justice system receives for its lethal injections.

Some say there are no bad cultures and they’re all just different.
I don’t see it.
I’ve tried to be cosmopolitan about it but some cultures are just wrong at their base.
