The article says that the issue is how fast Arkansas is planning to do its Medicaid reevaluation.
With a time frame of six months the focus is going to be speed rather than accuracy so it's likely a lot of people who are eligible are going to get kicked off.

That press secretary job?
No way in hell Donald Trump - as obsessed with image, youth & thin women would willingly hire an unattractive, 40 year old woman with a weight problem.
Sarah’s father had to be in on that.
And I’m sure money was involved.
This woman is in her early 40’s.
She has the same amount of work experience as a high school student working at a gas station cleaning toilets & mopping floors.
The last two years she’s been campaigning for governor she spent a total of zero months in Arkansas.
The entire time she was in Florida running around with her dad’s money - not working.
She is the biggest hypocrite when it comes to expecting people to ‘work’ for their benefits.
She ought to try that herself.
