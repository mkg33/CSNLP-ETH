Even as a child, the Baptist side of the family would give us those little books about, "the lake of fire", and I KNEW that that stuff wasn't real.
I was five or six years old maybe?
By the time it was time to make my "confirmation" (which happened at, like, age 13 or something?
I only did it for my grandma), I already knew that religion wasn't for me.
Of course I got into "trouble" when they started talking about "woman" coming from "Adam's rib".
I literally started laughing out loud and debated the reverend who was leading the class.
It caused a big kerfuffle, and I didn't really care.
