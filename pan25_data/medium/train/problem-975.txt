You know, compared to the scale of Covid the WHO did what they could.
But unfortunately they don't have the authority to override the bloody inane numbnut politics-over-science put up by so many countries and politicians (cough US repubes cough).
“Ngu Fankam Roland, the head of health for the affected district, told Reuters that those who died were suffering from nose bleeds, fever, joint pain and other ailments, causing death within a few hours.”.
That doesn't tell you anything about the time period of infection to death which is what you alluded to.
The final hours of viruses like Ebola are exactly as described there.
They went with the data they had.
China does not like independant investigations and would not allow international teams in.
They also turned 180° when more reliable data was released.
Are you new to the internet?
Even before 2020 there was always hysteria driven by Ebola outbreaks, especially in certain countries whos media loves to stir shit for views.
China executed over 100 local level officials for fudging the numbers and providing misleading or faulty data (faulty data is almost tradition).
