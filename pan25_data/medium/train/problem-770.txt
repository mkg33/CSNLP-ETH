The entire bottom 1/3 of the electorate is responsible for 90% of the bullshit conspiracy nonsense.
They will believe almost anything as long as it is only supported by allegations and speculation- there can't be any actual evidence.
If there isn't room for them to make a leap of faith in believing something, they refuse to believe it at all.
They need to feel like they are smart enough to make the connections that others don't.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
The cynical Republican leaders play to that credulity gap, stoking the conspiracy nonsense because those voters who who gravitate to nonsense are the ones who actually go to the polls in primary elections.
The whole charade is so transparent and obvious, except to the bottom third, for whom obvious transparency can only mean the Deep State is even more effective in misinforming people.
The easier it is to prove, the more it must be fake.
We have finally reached Terminal Stupidity.
