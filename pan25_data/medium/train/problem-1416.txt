Nope.
Lockheed Martin will provide heated seats for $25 million a month subscription per plane.
Another 50m to unlock supersonic cruise speed via a 15mb update.
Fighters don't really "face off" anymore.
Air supremacy is typically acheived through missile strikes and other means before any manned aircraft go in.
The seats are stuffed with eagle down, and the dashboard is made form the beaks of a thousand eagles.
Also, there are some eagles under the floorboards.
I agree they have things that we can't even imagine.
I'm just saying the 6th generation will not be ready for 10-15 years.
Even if it's done they spent 1 trillion developing the 5th generation they need to sell as many as possible before they release the next.
There is no point in rushing a 6th generation fighter to market as there is nothing to even compete with the f35 so why compete with yourself?
They need to sell as many 5th generations as possible before announcing the next is ready.
For all we know the 6th generation might be a flightless AI fighter.
Technology moves fast and if you don't think the u.s. military has secret technology you're delusional.
Also the b2 is not a fighter jet they play different roles.
You're correct I had to go back I read it was a while ago.
The lifetime cost will be 1.7 trillion.
More than likely a whole lot higher but from today's estimates that's what it is.
Maybe some things are similar but I doubt identical.
Only because the f35 is alot newer and should have alot of advanced features the older ones don't.
Think of the difference in a 2022 benz vs a 2005.
Lol.
