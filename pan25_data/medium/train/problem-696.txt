Racism is a part of that, imo.
There were some older gay men in Brevard county, FL that I knew who were republicans.
They also made racist comments.
My husband even had to quit a hairstylist over the racist comments he made while cutting his hair.
I guess the stylist thought my husband was white so he’d agree?
I don’t know.
But my husband pushed back and stopped going to his business (the stylist owned the place).
I’ve known a trans woman for decades (my moms best friend) who is a huge Trump supporter and been a republican long before Trump.
She likes to drop the n-word.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
