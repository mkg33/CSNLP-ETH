The longest Putin has the world busy with his murder spree bullshit instead of dealing with climate change the more time is wasted, or you think this is not affecting global economy and global energy?
Also, higher prices and limited supply are incentives to change - hopefully in the long run for conservation/efficiency and for different and more carbon friendly sources.
Which is happening, but along with it increased use of coal to try to supply the shortage of gas and the increase of gas storage at least till other sources are available, some countries are buying record levels of oil and goverment budgets already stressed by covid 19 are stressed even more limiting the amount of money available for such projects, prices going up adding pressure to the most vulnerable sector of society and taxes raised to try to cover for the extra money needed.
besides the energy makeup of a country cannot be changed in three months, if England or Germany had a 30 year plan for decarbonization and this situation thows the plan by the window, new budgets must be rewriten and while push for early adoption is desirable the current situation is creating political and economic unstunstablility that may end being very costly so it cannot be ignored, we dont want to end years down the line with climate denialists on government using a economic crisis as excuse.
also it would be much better if we decided to push forward faster without having to deal with a crisis manufactured by Petrol mogul Putin, besides I don't hear nothing about Russia decarbonizing itself, only trying to push its oil to others.
And Russia has a huge %age of the market, it is buoyed by higher prices, but likely not selling as much volume as before.
even allowing for increase by opec etc to offset it.
