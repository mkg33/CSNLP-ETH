It was 20-30 years ago, but not today.
Everyone just has outdated information.
Kind of like the Japanese suicide rate.
Many people still think Japan has a high suicide rate, despite it being lower than the US.
Work culture is mucj more intense in the US than Japan, in my experience.
There are a small number of black companies that force employees to work unpaid overtime, but they're the minority and employees are slowly leaving them for better workplaces.
Lack of time off can be a problem in Japan, with a minimum of only 2 weeks plus holidays, but that's also still better than the US which doesn't mandate any at all.
It also includes part time work, which is exceptionally popular in Japan, thus lowering the average.
According to the data the rate of part-time employment is 25%, which is around the same as Australia, just a bit higher than Germany and less than the Netherlands.
The US is at around 17%.
If you assume that the extra part-time population (compared to the US) does zero work, you get around 1746 hours per worker for the rest, which is about the same as the US data.
edit: oh and for the mandatory dinners and drinks.
Yeah first couple years you gotta go and they're not that bad all things considered.
Once you're an OG, you can try to get out of them from time to time.
No they don't.
Quit with this bullshit.
In the 90's, sure.
Unpaid overtime was rampant then.
It's not the 90's anymore, and the government cracked down on it quite a bit.
Uhm.
I was just checking job postings the other week.
I only saw a few that didn't mandate unpaid OT, and those jobs were only at multinationals.
I'll admit though, maybe everything changed within 1 week, idk!
