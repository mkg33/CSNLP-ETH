I choose to be sceptical about the article - considering that this Hungarian news site, unsurprisingly, is hellbent on insulting and criticising Ukraine in every Ukraine-related article that they've posted.
Obviously, I haven't really interacted with Carpathian Ukrainians enough to confidently judge anything - the westernmost region that I've ever lived in is Lviv oblast - but it seems to me that this whole "Hungarians and Romanians in Transcarpathia are being discriminated against" might be a bunch of isolated instances overblown by Hungarian and Romanian governments into some kind of a "big problem".
Your all (you and the other fellow Ukrainians who commented here here down-voted me) attitude left me a very bitter taste.
That is, after the initial shock passed.
Fool me, I thought Ukrainians are... not like this.
I haven't interacted with any of them, as I live in Romania.
But having minorities rights in all European countries seems to be what we should all aim for.
I think there is a lot of misinformation in Ukraine - like refugees being astonished that in Romania there are Ukrainian schools.
And last but not least you could read some of my older posts to check my attitude towards russia, comrade.
