And what exactly do you think will happen?
Ukraine invading Russia and everything is turning out great?
Russia is then being invaded/attacked an will probably start nukes.
All these people here saying Ukraine should attack more of Russia are not using their brains correctly.
What will happen is that Russia will have fewer planes and bombs to attack with.
Until Russia stops attacking entirely (which of course includes leaving Ukraine and freeing the people who have been kidnapped), that's all that matters, destroy as many Russian military resources as possible.
If Russia uses nukes, they lose Ukraine, they lose their fleet, they lose all their military in Ukraine.
What they're doing now doesn't make sense, but using nukes makes a lot less sense, if Russia has any goals they think they might achieve.
The threat of nukes is very hypothetical.
Russia's murdering people every day, Ukraine can either do something about that or not.
If Russia is willing to use nukes unprovoked (in a war they started and can end at any time), it's not going to come down to any one particular act of defense from a country they're attacking.
They can either be allowed to use the threat of nukes to freely commit atrocities, or they can be resisted and pushed back.
