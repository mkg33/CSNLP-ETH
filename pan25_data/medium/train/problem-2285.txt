Russia spent about $7,000,000,000 trying to destroy Ukraine's power plants, water and gas infrastructure..and everything's almost back to normal.
I live in front of a major power station and witnessed more than 10 rocket strikes on that power station and a herd of Iranian drones.
Luckily for the power station Russian cruise missiles and ballistic missiles are shit.
They hit in radius of 1.5 km.
Because of these terrorist strikes innocent people die.
And no I'm not talking about intercepted missiles.
Russian missiles are really this terrible.
Petro Andriushchenko, Adviser to the Mayor of Mariupol, has reported that a Russian ammunition storage point exploded in the city.
UPDATE Speaking a day after China called for urgent peace talks as it released its plan to end the war in Ukraine, Macron said peace was only possible if "the Russian aggression was halted, troops withdrawn and territorial sovereignty of Ukraine and its people was respected".
The third failed Russian offensive by the 155th Pacific marines around Vuhledar since the start of the big Russian winter offensive.
