To be honest, this is likely half as much a warning to Ukraine/helping keep the face of pressure for their suzerain, but also likely half as a backup in case Putin invades a Belarus that resists integration.
Even Lukashenko acknowledged Russia's annexation plans and tacitly dismissed them.
well to be fair, Belarus is willing to throw women at the problem since they aren't as stupid but just as cruel as Russia.
doing my best to sound as i am not praising Belarus for being significantly less sexist than Russia, but well; "more female war criminals".
again not having a government whose state religion is deeply traditionalist has some advantages when raising an arbitrary number to wave around.
But the point of the zerg rush is to create pressure into a checkmate scenario before your opponent can get established.
A 4/6/10 pool is basically dead if the attack is deflected or fails to cause sufficient economic damage.
In this analogy, Russia tried a rush, failed to cause sufficient damage, and now Ukraine is getting a fully upgraded army of siege tanks, goliaths, and science vessels.
