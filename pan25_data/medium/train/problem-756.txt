Oh that was long before Johnson.
New York City was a Confederate sympathizing city during the war, and even rioted for Lincoln to end the war.
Thankfully Ukraine doesn't have the death penalty (abolishing it is a prerequisite for joining the Council of Europe).
There is a chance for a second look at a case some time down the line.
Andrew Johnson, Lincoln died not 5 days after the end of the war.
Andrew Johnson was a southern sympathizer, and lessened the punishment on the south.
And for this, many think he is one of the worst presidents.
Johnson blocked the punishments, but Republicans didn't have a plan beyond the quick punishments.
Fining Southern states would have just ended up hurting freed slaves more than anything.
Punishments wouldn't have changed much.
The focus needed to be on propping up the freed slave population so they could better resist oppression.
The South had been fed 100+ years of propaganda leading up to the war.
Punishments would have ended up hurting the newly freed slave population, as they had to operate in the Southern economy now.
Northern communities who benefited from cheap Southern raw materials and components were Southern sympathizers.
