Perry only generally wins in my estimation due to the same mistakes that always seems to be the issue with stereotypical old school Democratic party.
They spend almost no money in general on this race dispite it being a winnable district.
They put up bad candidates or candidates with no name recognition, spend no money on TV/internet/advertisement.
I actually know quite a few of the folks living in the district who always try to convince the state and national party of this for it to fall on deaf ears.
Basically, from my understanding the the old school Dems running the party in the area ignore them.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Heâ€™s terrible and entrenched.
I suspect he may be indicted along with Trump eventually by Jack Smith.
Perhaps wishful thinking but he certainly hates democrats enough to continue to try to lie to all of us and try to compensate for unfavorable election results.
Perry represents the Harrisburg area in south-central Pennsylvania, which has flown to the left in recent years.
In 2022, Perry's opponent got very little national attention or money, and didn't have a big-time campaign.
Perry only won by 7.8 points - close enough that a better-supported challenger could take him out.
This district also would have voted for Trump by just 4 points.
While I don't have the numbers in front of me, I believe Democrat Josh Shapiro won it in his race for Governor.
It's completely winnable.
