NATO would absolutely nuke them back.
There’s a reason no nuclear bomb has been used in conflict since 1945.
Nuclear bombs aren’t precision weapons, their only purpose is to destroy everything in a large area and make it largely unusable for a long while after.
The only people worth using nukes against are other nuclear powers, but if a nuke were to be launched that affected other nuclear powers in any significant way there would be a nuclear response.
A nuclear detonation in Ukraine would have fallout that would hit several nato countries (that’s without factoring in possible secondary detonations from one of ukraines major nuclear plants), you’re insane if you think that wouldn’t provoke a nuclear response.
There has been an uneasy agreement between the major powers to avoid the usage of WMD’s in general since the end of ww2 and if that’s broken a lot of people are going to die.
The US has already essentially said that any nuclear strike from Russia against Ukraine would provoke a nuclear response from western powers, country’s don’t say that kind of thing as a bluff.
For those unfamiliar with Russian, "mir" means peace and Earth and was the name of their long orbiting space-station.
Reagan proposed we name ours "freedom" in response, but what eventually got made with partnerships was the ISS "International Space Station".
