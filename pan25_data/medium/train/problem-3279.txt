I’m not arguing for disarmament.
Trying to pretend I’m secretly for DeJoy makes your argument look bad, I hate the guy.
I’m pointing out that people are somehow hand waving people away from noticing that the republican way of doing shit doesn’t actually help people or their actual cause in the long run.
It helps NO ONE if he illegally fired DeJoy that way and then got tied up in a legal Kerfuffle that would most certainly not allow Biden to get his guy in _ANYWAY_ because there’s still enough DeJoy advocates on the board that _they’d just elect someone else like him again_… but now we’d need to wait for that new guy to give cause for firing and enact some other terrible policy.
__Biden wouldn’t get to nominate the PMG, the board who isn’t willing to fire DeJoy would.__.
In general, be courteous to others.
