SLAVA UKRAINI!
What a wonderful news.
Defending country that has its own source of ammo/equipment has great chance of repelling its invader.
Hope every bullet/shell finds its Russian target.
Spare the shell and spoil the Russian.
Production of 152 and 122 mm artillery shells has been established in Ukraine.
The production of mines and other kinds of ammunition has been planned, too.
Source: Oleksii Danilov, the Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, during the 24/7 national newscast.
Quote: "What our armament manufacturers are working on right now will cause big trouble to these fascists who invaded our land.
It is with great pleasure that I announce that we established the production of both 152 and 122 mm calibre \[Soviet-style shells – ed.\] at our enterprises.
Details: Danilov added that the rocket program approved in Ukraine is being 100% financed and personally controlled by President Zelenskyy.
Danilov has not yet confirmed that an anti-aircraft system Patriot would arrive in Ukraine in short notice, but he said he was convinced that the partners’ support of Ukraine would be continuous and ever-increasing.
Previously: At the beginning of November Oleksii Reznikov, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine, stated that the enterprises of Ukroboronprom, the Ukrainian defence industry company, established the production of 122 mm and 152 mm calibre shells as well as that of 120 mm mines which are already being widely used.
He hoped that during a few months Ukrainian manufacturers would "increase the volume of production.
