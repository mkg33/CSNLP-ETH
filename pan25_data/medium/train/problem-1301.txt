A big problem with these migrant rescue ships is that we don't know whether or not which of the rescue organisations have ties to human traffickers.
It is very likely there are probably some of those rescue organisations that have ties.Traffickers know that if a ship has the words "rescue ship" in it there will be at least one country that is willing to take the ship in.
They know that the rescue organisations are going to paint the picture of "there are hungry, tired asylum seekers on board.
You must take them in!".
They know that there will be a controversy if the country refuses to take them in.
They don't care about the human life their practices cost if such a ship sinks.
All the traffickers care about is money.
In order to stop traffickers, it may be neccessary to continue stopping ships from docking in harbors.
Less acceptance of the ships, less ships will be coming in.
Because if we continue to let them dock their ships, traffickers keep their money flow and will continue their practices.
Which leads to even more pressure on Europe's asylum system.
It sounds as though France really is pulling its weight and that maybe the Italians havenâ€™t framed the issue in good faith here.
I assure you that this migrants charade is nothing more than a petty political move by our far right government.
It has always been their propaganda tool.
