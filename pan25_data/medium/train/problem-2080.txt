Wonder if part of the incentive isn't genuinely to try get folks in Germany to have more kids.
Would make total sense given Germany has a below-replacement birthrate?
Realistically no one's going to have a baby because the child benefits rise by a couple of Euro a month.
This is a measure to keep up with inflation.
Even with out goversafety nets and subsidized child care having a kid is still a net drain on your income and can be a hiccup in your career.
The idea is not to encourage people to have children because they get money, but rather that young couples don’t feel discouraged because of the high cost of living and food, gas, etc.
taking away the worry for the first couple years.
Its a nice policy to have around for those who are thinking between having a child or nah it’s too much economic effort.
It might be the intention, but i bet there are still going to be many many young people who will look at the expenses of having children and decide not to, even with a few more euros a month on subsidies.
