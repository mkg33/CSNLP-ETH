Look who they "contribute" to.
In the past three years they've contributed to RAGA(Republicans attorney general's association) and to Rule of law defense fund (a branch of RAGA).
Said defense fund we're responsible for the robo calls on Jan 5 for the January 6th insurrection.
Furthermore, their p.r & lobbyists firms are ran by mainly Republicans.
Also the D.C law firm.
How do you think they're allowed to still operate in the U.S.?
They've paid for the privilege.
Over 3 million..., And counting over the last three to four years (so far).
