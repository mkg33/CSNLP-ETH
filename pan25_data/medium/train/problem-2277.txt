You’re both making points that aren’t going to change.
The person you’re replying to misunderstood you along the way and thinks you were denying that people are smuggled to America illegally.
You are trying to say that will get you deported.
You’re both making correct points, there was just a point where you both lost what the other was saying.
I don’t know how much more clear I can be.
There’s an entire legal process.
You can’t just pay to put your child on a one-way trip to a foreign sovereign country.
That article describes the legal immigration process, it doesn’t in any way refute the notion that people smuggling is a thing.
You think a boat load of people just snatched a baby for laughs?
$50 says your child hasn't ever been in mortal danger in a lawless 4th world shithole country, so I'm not sure how you feel qualified to judge...
The anonymous mother back in Haiti?
How is anyone supposed to know what she was thinking, if it was even her doing?
And why do you care if you’re willing to reduce their whole country to a “crack house” in an act of appalling dismissal of a whole society?
Sending children back to their parents, what else can be done?
Shrug and say “ok the baby belongs to us now?” The US is a country, not an adoption agency.
They’re right, though, despite your arrogant and quite rude remark.
Rather than asking others to inform you, why don’t you learn about it yourself?
That would actually be amazing.
