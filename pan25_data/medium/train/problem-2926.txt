Bakhmut reminds of the Battle of Kollaa during Winter War, 1 Finnish division against 4 divisions, 1 tank brigade of Soviets.
Kollaa is considered to be one of the most difficult locations to defend during the Winter War.
The Red Army is estimated to have fired nearly 40,000 artillery rounds at the defence line, during a single day.
A famous quote is Major General Hägglund's question, "Will Kollaa hold?
(Kestääkö Kollaa?
)", to which Lieutenant Aarne Juutilainen (bit of a legend himself) replied, "Kollaa will hold (Kollaa kestää), unless the orders are to run away."
The simple question and reply have entered Finnish lexicon as an expression of perseverance and resolve in the face of impending difficulty or crisis.
It would actually be funny if the UAF was baiting Russia into sending more troops there, only for the UAF to wipe a couple thousand more troops out.
I realize all information coming from this conflict is tainted, but I'm inclined to believe the increased numbers of Russian KIAs, given how they're scraping the bottom of the barrel by using prisoners as infantry.
It would be funny if they could identify key locations that the Russians would use for command posts and hide explosives and recording equipment in there and blow it up once they move their commanders in etc.
That is what any good commander should be doing as part of their job.
Know when it is time to retreat when necessary to prevent wasting lives of soldiers under his command.
