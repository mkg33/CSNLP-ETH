In a lot of these cases of mass murder, there is no question of guilt, or intent.
the risk of wrongful conviction is in some cases nil and their danger to society extreme.
And based on the scale of the damage the person is capable of inflicting, their mental state should become less relevant to their sentence because any reoffence is catastrophic.
Society is a social contract, society owes these people nothing.
If you think a few years in prison will rehabilitate a member if the Islamic state then you don't have a grip on reality .
We are talking about mass murder here , not stealing smartphones and to compare the two shows absolutely no understanding of the gravity of this horrific incident.
Its also bizarre how you mention that life imprisonment is an especially cruel death sentence considering the incredibly cruel death sentence handed out to 86 innocent victims .
Edit: that's not even counting the injured or taking into account that he will probably be freed in half the time .
Incredible .
