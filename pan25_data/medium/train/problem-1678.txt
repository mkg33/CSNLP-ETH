> Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke "Afro-American racists".
Russia should "introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements â€“ extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S.
It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics".
