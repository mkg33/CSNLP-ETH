Well, if the GOP's absolutism and obstructionism is so pervasive that they cannot lead amongst themselves, then what business have they to lead this diverse nation?
Their government gig is their side-job their main job is being social media diva's and shills for Qannon.
They have some serious social media posting to get back to and some fundraising to do, they can't be bothered to do their "day job" of keeping the government running or even bothering to get that government operational.
They need everyone to know that they're still MAGA-Strong.
