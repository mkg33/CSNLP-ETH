We’re getting there.
It’s still trench warfare but they’re losing.
Actually, Democrats played a great deal of hardball in Congress recently to overcome Republican obstructionism and get all those infrastructure and industrial bills through.
In the next two years, these projects will create millions of jobs that the Democrats can brag about in rust belt states and potentially competitive districts.
I think this will be easy to do when constituents start seeing tangible results delivered to them.
After 2024, we might just have those majorities, even with that map.
Especially since the Republicans are now falling to some very bad factional infighting.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
