At my school, “liberal studies” was a custom major that you could set up if you had an advisor who agreed to it.
People did lots of hybrid programs.
Someone could have made a “liberal studies” degree that was a combination of international relations and political science or business management or something.
To be fair, I have a BA in Biology, but that is only because the State University didn't have a degree for Ecology Mathematics.
When people ask I always say I have a BA in Bio and another in Psych, but I really had most of my focus on ecology, animal behavior \[through mathematical modelling\], and a lot of game theory.
Other Private schools had a degree in Animal Behavior, but it was less intensive than what I did and only walked out with a BA in Biology and one in Psych that sounds pretty lame compared to what I was actually studying back then.
