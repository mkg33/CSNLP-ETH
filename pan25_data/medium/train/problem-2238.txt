I'm an American living in Australia (Have been since late 2004) and I literally the right-wing here pretty consistently bringing up crap from America that doesn't even make sense here.
Right now we have some what I would call far right-wing connected people trying to loosen gun laws and bring in guns.
I've seen attempts at trying to do away with compulsary voting, gerrymandering etc.
I think at one point there was even a reference made to trying to form some sort of electoral college here.
Now obviously these aren't mainstream here by any stretch but that isn't the point.
The point is that these people are coordinating heavily with their international right-wing brethren, inviting them over, going over to the states... so yeah if there was ever going to be a formation of a world government it would be these guys.
Hell during the TFG's Presidency I saw quite a few people online that were very much not American expressing a desire for Trump to become their leader or worse for him to become Leader of the world basically.
So yeah if anyone was ever to have ambitions for world domination and control it would be them.
