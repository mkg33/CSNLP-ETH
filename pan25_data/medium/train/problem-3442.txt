It's bad for a plethora of reasons, most notably for making one's focus on their studies split with a tedious job, which makes it much harder to digest what they're learning.
University studies involves what you'll do for the next 40-50 years.
Some asshat's business you work at to afford rent just distracts you and burns you out, making success in school and at work both questionable.
But That headline combined with that age range does seem pretty odd in implying that a 23 or 24 year old might not need to be working for some reason.
That’s after most university students graduate too.
That’s just how the data is measured apparently.
People should be in Education or Training until the age of 18.
This can be full time education, apprenticeships or part time work and part time education (rare).
It states the rate of inactivity had been declining for years, but increased due to covid, so they're measuring the number of student aged people in employment now, vs how many were in employment through and after covid.
Which... Yeah.
