I grew up Mormon in Utah but always knew lots of men from several different cultures who were really misogynistic.
Mormonism is really really sexist and abusive towards women but it’s just a really nuanced topic.
Honestly, Mormon men raping women is actually not as common as you’d expect, unless you’re talking about their wives, whom they definitely sexually, physically, and emotionally abuse.
But like men are actually held surprisingly accountable for having sex outside of marriage; personally, I think it goes back to the church’s polygamous past- the boys were punished brutally for stealing the old men’s women so a young boy found to be having sex is usually as punished as a young girl.
They don’t actually believe men don’t have self control and it isn’t their fault.
Sadly many kids think ESL kids are dumb or something.
I know in my school people were under that impression.
It is quite the opposite and was very obvious with math, a subject that that isn't dependent on what language you speak.
