If anything, this deserves another Special Counsel because I'm guessing that they didn't report any of this to Congress which likely breaks the law.
Somehow I find this makes Barr and Durham seem less corrupt, to be honest.
100% corruption would be ignoring the tip entirely and pretending they never heard about it.
But by having Durham look into it at all Barr did something that, assuming the reporting is true, wasn't in plain support of Trump's insulation from legal consequences.
