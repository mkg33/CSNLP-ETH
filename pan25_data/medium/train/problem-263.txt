Not an expert, but undersea cables are a far more secure approach to data transmission within Taiwan than the backup satellite relay the article mentions.
Couldn't these outages create new opportunities for infiltration or passive data skimming?
Additionally, each broken cable requires on-site work to repair.
Once raises alarms and demands heightened attention to security during the operation.
Same with repairs 2-10.
But after 20 times in 5 years... human nature has me thinking there will be eventual lapses which can grant foreign agents direct access to the cables themselves.
It's happening so often that Taiwanese authorities that they may start using the seized dredgers as target practice & artificial reefs.
There isn't any more space in Matsu's ports, and it's proving costly to maintain them until they can auction them off.
We're gonna "find out" with China eventually anyways, they keep making it perfectly clear they won't stop until Taiwan is theirs.
The longer we wait the worse it's going to be.
