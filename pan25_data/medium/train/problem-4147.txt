There is nothing genuine about Putin, or anything he says or does.
I think Zelensky knows this, but this act serves to show the rest of the world, once and for all, that Putin is an unreasonable tyrant out to grab land.
If Russia ends up getting to keep any land, even a little, that would serve to legitimize the war in the eyes of many Russians.
For that reason, any peace agreement which involves ceding territory to Russia should be avoided if at all possible.
Whether it is likely to change is one thing, but Zelensky has already been on the record multiple times stating Russia keeping any land is a nonstarter for peace.
This includes Crimea.
They're beating Russia on every front.
The last "objective" assessment I read last week sad that Russia is only making progress in Bahkmut.
Sorry if I spelled that wrong.
Wagner, the PMC is leading that offensive.
If it suddenly jumps and bites you, what did you expect?
It's a venomous snake.
That is its nature - we're only deluding ourselves to think it isn't a venomous snake.
