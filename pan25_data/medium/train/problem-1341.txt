Honestly if you look at the American system in regards to death panel the people on private insurance are the ones that normally face death panels by number crunchers at a private for profit company insurance.
Also if you look at the massive amount of money Medicare spends on unnecessary end of Life Care it's so far from the truth to message to people that the government's going to pressure people to die early when the last 50 years nothing of the sort has ever happened.
If anything Medicare has a problem right now with too much futile and of Life Care.
