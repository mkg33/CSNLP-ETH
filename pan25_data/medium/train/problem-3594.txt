Kazakhstan's role has been reversed since the war began.
Goods traveled from Russia to Kazakhstan but now they move the other way.
It's mainly non-sanctioned goods like food, clothes etc.
But you never know what else is happening unofficially.
Putin is going to invade Kazakhstan at some point, it's just a matter of time.
He'll use the same excuse he used in Ukraine - that they're harboring terrorists and need to be cleansed.
He won't stop until either NATO or China stands up to him, so hopefully one of them does soon.
Because if not, we all know how this movie ends.
With Putin in control of most/all of Central Asia and then looking west towards Europe with his army behind him...and no one left who can stop him.
I don't think Russia is gonna invade anyone else anytime soon, it will take a good while to even recover from the current "special military operation".
No, but if Putin had wanted a big, easy win, he should have invaded KZ instead of Ukraine.
But he was stupid (in so many ways).
The 'stans see the writing on the wall now and are going to arm up and negotiate defense treaties.
