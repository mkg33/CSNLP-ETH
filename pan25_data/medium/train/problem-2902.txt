Anyone from Norway can explain how this is tolerated by the electorate?
Judging by the EV adoption at least population is more green than these policies suggest.
I think quite the opposite.
It’s energy that the world needs and wants.
It also provides my country with massive revenues that can be used to fund new industry, technology and so much more.
An industry that employs thousands of people.
We can’t all enact terrible energy policies like what Germany wants and does.
First of all, these new licences they sell probably won't come online for years?
So it's nothing to do with our current needs that may exist due to the war.
This is much worse (for the world) than not emitting sooner but probably less profitable for Norway.
It sucks that this is the path they seem to have chosen (I am just going off what people are saying in this thread) because you already are very rich and have a sovereign wealth fund.
You don't need to do this and can instead be a good example to the other petro states.
Secondly its definitely energy that we don't need as society going forward.
Period.
Fossil fuels should stay in the ground as much as possible if we have any chance of not fucking out environment completely.
Just because we have been using it doesn't mean we "need" it.
1) It will take some time to further develop yes.
Most of the new licences are however in areas that already have infrastructure and activity so they are not exactly brand new areas.
