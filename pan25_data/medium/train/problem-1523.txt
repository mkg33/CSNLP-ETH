They dont have the ability too without doing exactly what progizen has been doing.
The russian MoD has shown as much as the regulars are meat waving too: See Vuhledar.
Their wonderwaffes are dead in the water (BMPT getting roasted in the open the moment it sees real combat, and i imagine the t14 is stuck in the red square) and their command structure is too busy yelling at each other to attempt to guide their soldiers sans an NCO (See all the RU pov videos of them legit laying in the open, not entering defilade 2ft to their right and getting rinsed while their commander yells over the radio).
If he had achieved actual military successes, his political position would have likely skyrocketed.
But Wagner’s Bakhmut campaign does’t seem to be much more advanced than it was 4 months ago and losses are mounting.
Now he’s left with massive costs, a lot of dead mercenaries, no real successes to show and he has just recently publicly criticized Russian army.
I think best case scenario (for him) is that he shuts up, falls in line, Wagner becomes fully subservient to the army and he’s allowed to continue as before.
