Autocratic regimes often brand themselves with names that do not represent who they are for this exact reason - so people mistake attacks on them as an attack on Islam and they can cry prejudice and Islamaphobia.

They’ve held our name and our country hostage for 43 too many years.

That is always an issue with people who act "in the name of God", why would an omnipotent being need some asshole to act in his stead.
If your god doesn't strike me down with lightning, He is either okay with what I do or say or he isn't but is too powerless to do anything about it.
...and then God looked down from the heavens and said "Kill every fucker that you think opposes me, I like nothing more than violence Forgive?
Fuck no Slaughter the cunts!
You will be rewarded for the number of Infidel heads you bring me to the sky palace" Then God faded into the clouds, and of course, it began to rain.
