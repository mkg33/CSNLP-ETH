While I'm sure Russia wouldn't mind getting to him, he's no longer the valuable target he used to be.
They likely know that him dying would only intensify the war against them now as it would be blamed on them no matter how much they denied it, and rather than giving up the people of Ukraine would likely rally even harder behind his name (and retain or even increase the support from the west).
It may even be to the point where a world war would break out if Russia had him killed.
He's obviously not "safe" still, but Russia would have to be even more idiotic than they already are if they decided to still go for him at this point, so why not appear publicly?
It very much emboldens his troops while effectively demoralizing Russia's because he's nearly in sight of them and essentially giving the middle finger.
Seeing Lukashenko's name often reminds me of a brilliant scene early on in Servant of the People.
Zelensky is practicing meeting foreign heads of state using body doubles, and immediately stands up each time to greet them.
When the Lukashenko double walks in, Zelensky's advisor stops him saying something along the lines of "no no, there's no need to get up for him".
Zelensky casually replies "of course".
