This is unfortunately mostly symbolic.
Ukraine probably needs some 200-500 tanks to actually make a meaningful difference, the UK doesn't even have that many total let alone to spare.
However Symbolism is important once the UK gives Ukraine tanks and Russia (surprise surprise) does fuck all about it, others will follow.
Ukraine's head general said 300 main battle tanks (and 700 IFVs) would be realistic to return to pre invasion lines.
NATO has collectively thousands of both in storage that will likely end up being scrapped, so it's mostly a matter of having political will and some training.
They need Leopard 2s, they are the only vehicle that's good enough, that's nearby, already in europe, can be parted with by their owners, and have enough of them to make a difference.
It's going to be a lot easier to get Leopard 2s to Ukraine, than Abrams.
The Leopards are already nearby.
This is partly true.
Those are valuable assets, however this kind of fails to see the point of western tanks for Ukraine.
It's been a year and Ukraine has more Armored vehicles than it started with, They captured a staggering amount of fully intact T-80s, T-90s and T-72s in the Kharkiv counter-offensive.
and many of those tanks arent even going to come into play for months.
they have to repair and refit them.
