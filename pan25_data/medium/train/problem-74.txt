This same problem goes all the way up the chain of command to the very top, the luitenant tells the captain all the troops have stellar accuracy so he gets a promotion, the captain tells the major all the vehicles are in working order, etc etc etc.
Everyone is bullshitting everyone and everyone knows it, but they all smile and knod and go along with it anyway.
Honestly, this is a very light cost to put Russia's military on the dumpster for another 30 years for Western Nations.
Fighting a well armed, well trained and highly motivated force hellbent on pushing out the invaders with poorly paid, poorly trained conscripts who's equipments have been sold off by their own commander so they could buy a luxury apartment tends to do that.
The Russian army is a fiercly meritocratic organization in theory.
If you want to get a promotion, you need to show results.
The problem is however, corruption has crept into the ranks because the pay for active service is stupidly low.
Many people NEED to get that pay rise to sustain their lives.
Lets put you in the shoes of a Russian drill sergeant.
You have 2 kids a wife and her parents to look after, you want to rise up the ranks as fast as you can to look after them.
