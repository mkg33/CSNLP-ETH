Can't really blame them.
After everything the Nazis did to Poland, Germany got off without paying reparations, because Soviet-occupied Poland "forgave" the debt Soviet-occupied East Germany owed them.
I find it highly unlikely that the Soviets needed to trade favors between their puppet states.
If they wanted something, they would've just taken it.
I don't disagree, I just can't help but sympathize with Poland.
After being brutalized by the Nazis, then further occupied and abused by the Soviets, they even got screwed on the reparations.
One could even say that the new land could technically be considered a reparation, except at the same time soviet union took part of Poland from the east.
Look, I'm Polish myself.
The PiSs government refuses to restore the independence of our courts which is a requirement to get money from the EU.
And the amount we are supposed to get is 1/5 of our GDP.
This is also while Poles are struggling to survive from paycheck to paycheck.
To divert attention from that Kaczy≈Ñski now started talking about reparations.
That we don't get money because of Germans.
I swear that despite what the party is saying about being anti Russia.
Nearly everything they do is exactly what Russia would want us to do.
They were extremely successful at dividing us and ruining any good relationship with all neighbors we have.
Territories confiscated by the international community due to conquest and genocide are not war reparations.
Besides which, even after those borders were redrawn, Poland still lost territory equal in size to the Czech Republic compared to before the war.
