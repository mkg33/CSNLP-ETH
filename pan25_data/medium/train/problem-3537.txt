I can't speak for the average person, but from what I experienced and what I saw in my family, it wasn't necessarily Escobar, but the surrounding gangs.
My older brother was robbed at gun point a couple of times.
Police was less than helpful.
I remember one time in particular in the late 80s where someone on a motorcycle rode by firing some sort of automatic weapon at every house, including my grandparents, where we lived.
This was in Envigado, Antioquia BTW.
This has been said a thousand times and it'll be said a thousand times more but it's crazy that the cartels can be this brazen and have little to no consequences.
The worst part of it all is that civilians just trying to live their lives get caught in the middle and used as pawns.
Mexican government was part of the reason why they attained so much power.
This stuff reminds me of Escobar's case, where he had Colombia held hostage and did everything in his power to avoid extradition.
I don't think it's worth it for mexico to let this dude back out because the cartels are just going to continue murdering people anyways.
