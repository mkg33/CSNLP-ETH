And contracts.
In most sports players lives will be made very legally difficult if they break the contracts they signed which mandates them to show up when and where they’re told.
Losing your job, sponsorships, court enforced fines, likely losing that years entire pay, and still having to feed a family is not a slight legal inconvenience.
Slight legal consequence is a parking fine.
Even if it’s not as major as the death penalty, these are still major legal ramifications.
You’re asking these guys to give up their livelihoods for one specific cause you care about when they already donate more than you probably ever could to other humanitarian causes.
It is easy for you to virtue signal and act as though you wouldn’t do exactly as they are.
But in practice I have no doubt that you would do the very same.
Especially as a sports athlete, you don’t really have the option to break it off with one team by breaching contracts and simply get to continue on with your career.
Quite the mindless comment.
You can be upset without blaming individuals who had no real part in the things you are upset about.
