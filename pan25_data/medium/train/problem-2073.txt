“India is being opportunistic” and is that wrong, if so why?
India isn’t directly financing the war.
Russia is.
To say “India time out, it’s not fair you get cheaper oil” is just a crass thing to say in a capitalist, globalist world.
Especially when capitalism + globalisation prefer to exploit poorer nations because it’s cheaper to.
Is that not opportunistic?
I’d be worried if the oil is fattening the pockets of the rich, rather than blaming them for buying cheaper oil.
Oil is precious and a necessity.
We need to have a meeting with all world leaders immediately and see what we can do about changing these rules.
Wow what a crazy concept, I can't believe a leader of a nation is making decisions based on what's best for his nation and his people, this is outrageous.
Yeah, but I doubt that double dealing is gonna help in the long run.
The clock is against them in terms of getting a sufficient domestic military industry running.
They have to know that Russian shit they've been buying for years won't cut it.
