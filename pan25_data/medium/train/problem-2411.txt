As for devolving to plurality, what that means is that, over time, you end up with nobody getting a majority of votes, and while you might have 3, 5, or 20 parties, the only way anything gets done is for those parties to congeal into larger coalitions.
It's effectively the same thing we have now with the Tea Party/MAGA folks, the Libertarians, and the Republicans on one side and the neoliberals, the social Democrats, the "progressives", the Greens, and Bernie Sanders on the other.
The difference is, aside from the Libertarians and the Greens (and Bernie, although he's got one foot in the party knowing it's the only way to actually get elected nationally in the current system), the rest are all subsets of the two major parties.
RCV ends up looking nearly identical over time.
