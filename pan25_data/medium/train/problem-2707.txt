Btw, this is the same amendment that tried to add singleshot bolt-action hunting rifles and pump-action turkey shotguns to this "assault weapons" ban.
Which would classify those as "assault weapons" and give the government the legal footing to ban virtually all firearms, in a country where a significant portion of the population relies on hunting to put food on their table.
Trudeau has repeatedly and openly lied by saying that the bill and amendment contain no hunting rifles or shotguns (they actually contain a number of the most widespread and popular hunting rifles and shotguns in the country).
When directly confronted about it, he resorts back to trying to say Conservatives are being bought by American gun lobbies whilst jerking off his own party for trying to pass legislation they don't even understand.
Anti gun policies polled incredibly well last election in the GTA.
When the liberals lost the GTA harper won.
He's doing this for one reason.
It buys votes in the GTA for people who have no idea what they are talking about, consume us news and have gang violence in their community through smuggled us weapons.
