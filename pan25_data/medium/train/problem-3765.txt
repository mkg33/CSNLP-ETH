Pell was personally responsible for implementing a scheme where the church would pay victims a small sum of money in exchange for silence, and then use their very-well resourced team of lawyers to harass and discredit anyone who dared to go to the authorities, and if the cases ever went to court they used the usual disgusting tactics that are frequently used against victims of sexual assault.
A lot of these victims would end up committing suicide.
I'm convinced every single high level official within the Catholic church was aware of what was happening.
With the scale and breadth of what was happening, how could they have not known?
I convinced they all are part of it.
But I know that's not politically correct to say.
But, it would answer why they don't give 2 fucks about these families and those kids.
That's not to say that every staff member of the church is evil, but just like every shitty business the good people are often powerless to change anything.
Regardless of whether George Pell was guilty of being personally committing these crimes (I personally think he is, and benefitted from surviving 30 years until the court case unlike some of his alleged victims), he has a lot of blood on his hands, and behaved like a mafia boss.
So this is great news to start the year.
That makes a lot of sense.
I was always disturbed by how the church moved priests from different towns and cities after they were accused or even charged.
It just always felt like this church society of people are fine with SA as long as it's not openly known.
It will always make me question the morality and ethics of everyone invovled.
The church is a business and like all multinational businesses the executive team will always rally around to protect the business because profits and power are the only thing they worship.
