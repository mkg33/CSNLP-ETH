Best not to underestimate them.
IIRC the naval F-35 was customised for the Royal Navy requirement for a successor to the Harrier; the old jump jet operated very successfully from the _Invincible_ class for many years.
Those little carriers packed a fair punch.
Not in comparison to the giant floating airbases the US Navy ran then and still runs today, and not in comparison to what the Navy expects from the _Queen Elizabeth_ class, but anything else afloat had to worry.
I wouldnâ€™t say their current military situation is a result of pacifism.
The terms of surrender to the US required dismantling their military and allowing the US to station in the region instead.
Since then, Japan has slowly regained responsibilities for defending against domestic and foreign threats, but the US has retained their presence in the region.
Yep, over time Japan has slowly introduced legislation to rebuild their military forces alongside the US being stationed in the region and signed various treaties with the US.
Full on occupation and bans on Japanese military ended many decades ago.
