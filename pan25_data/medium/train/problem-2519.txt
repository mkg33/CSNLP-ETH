Just look at all the oligarchs that have been killed already.
Those few people who are at the very top of the pyramid closest to Putin or who'se involvement is not easy to hide can be just be used as escape goats to redeem the rest of the elite from any blame.
At this point the war is about nothing else but Putin's survival.
He can't politically stop the war unless he gets something out of it so that he can spin it as a victory.
Ukraine isn't (and shouldn't) going to give any land for Russia which means this "victory" is not going to be a thing.
Putin knows that if does not have anything to show for his people after all of this loss of life that he is going to be killed by his people or by the elite.
"We have successfully defeated the Nazis within Ukraine We have dealt an astronomical blow to the perifidious Azov, and destroyed countless headquarters and infrastructure on which they depended".
"With our objectives complete, we will now end the Special Military Operation and recall the troops home!
".
