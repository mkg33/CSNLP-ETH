Fun fact: The US props the Saudi regime using taxpayer funds to gather intelligence for it: “ Saudi Arabia and the U.S. are strategic allies,[4][146] and since President Obama took office in 2009, the U.S. has sold $110 billion in arms to Saudi Arabia.
[147][148] The National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013 began cooperating with the Saudi Ministry of Interior in an effort to help ensure "regime continuity".
An April 2013 top secret memo shows the agency's program of providing "direct analytic and technical support" to the Saudis on "internal security" matters.
The CIA had already been gathering intelligence for the regime long before.

They’re talking about nukes people.
They will get their own nukes for a “deterrent”.
Then all we need is one Islamic extremist nut job firing a missile and we all go boom.
They've already got them.
They're sitting in Pakistan ATM.
That was basically the deal.
Saudis fund Pakistan's nuke program.
Pakistan gives Saudis nukes when requested.
First strike could do a whole lot of damage before saudis take delivery of their nukes.
It could effectively end any possible war before it even begins.
