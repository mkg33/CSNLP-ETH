Under Rich Cordrayâ€™s leadership, the CFPB recovered $12 billion for some 31 million consumers who were victimized by financial schemes and scams by big banks, payday lenders, debt collectors, for-profit colleges and credit bureaus.
Right, according to Republicans that's $12 Billion in ill-gotten gains that should have remained with the banks and others.
It's about more than the CFPB.
It's about the legitimacy of federal agencies regulating commerce without direct authorization from congress.
It won't just be the CFPB that gets dismantled.
All federal agency oversight could be in jeopardy.
The wedge for this case is that the funding for the CFPB comes from interest earned by the Fed, not via levied dollars.
The court's decision could stipulate that all funding for federal agencies has to be through legislative appropriations.
This would give congress the ability to, overnight, defund most federal oversight, including EPA, HUD, DOE, etc, just by omitting their appropriations.
This is the intent of the lawsuit, even though CFPB is the gateway.
