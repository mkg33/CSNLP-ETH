SCMP is just an extension of the Chinese propaganda arm at this point.
Don’t let the fact it’s based in Hong Kong and owned by Alibaba confuse you.
At the end of the day, the Chinese State controls what they can print.
You can literally look up pictures of the pandas from yesterday and they look totally healthy.
Literally hundreds to thousands of people go to that zoo and see them everyday.
And they take just as many pictures.
The American people would be outraged if they actually saw animal abuse at a zoo so no way this would have been allowed to continue.
Just think of how upset people off when they had to shoot Harambe a few years ago because they thought they were saving a child’s life.
For me they spilled over when they used “Mainland” to describe their country.
There’s only one reason to use that when the context doesn’t call for that distinction.
I just don’t understand the need to lie about such an easily disprovable thing like animal abuse.
Make America look bad?
Why?
What have we done to China to make them hate us so much?
I lived in China.
I love China.
Let me tell you, I saw so much casual and cruel animal abuse on such a regular basis that I could never have the time to write it all down.
They don’t need to be investigated because they have literally run a million local news stories talking about the pandas leaving and the pandas look totally fine.
They are just really old.
The were given to the Memphis Zoo on a 20 year lease which just expired.
That’s why they are leaving.
