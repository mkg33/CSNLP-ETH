I was actually raised in a Christian household.
My dad was Mormon until leaving the church with more questions than answers at 16, and my mom the daughter of a Christian Reformed Church missionary.
We were never very churchy, despite my grandpa's position in the church, as he was always one who pushed that all religions were different versions of the same message, and we're all praying to the same place.
He was also one for treating everyone with respect, "as Christ would."
I no longer attend church, but I still pray, and still try to act in accordance with my views of faith.
It's just a shame that not every "Christian" looks at things that way...
