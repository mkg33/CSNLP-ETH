The hard-right wing of the Republican Party in the House (Louie Gohmert, Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows, Matt Gaetz, et.
al) have been leading their Republican house caucus for years from the back bench.
A key to their power has always been the relative anonymity and lack of a spotlight on their antics and moves, and plausible deniability by having the speaker go out there and explain away the real reasoning for Republican actions in the house.
What remains to be seen is whether they will totally fuck up their system they've had for years and pull back the curtain on themselves.
Will their reflexive contrarian ways and thirst for troll opportunities make a spectacle out of the speaker vote, blowing their cover, despite having no alternative to put up instead of McCarthy?
