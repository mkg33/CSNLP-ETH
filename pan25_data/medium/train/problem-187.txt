Yes, Greece is going to purchase F-35s.
What's your point?
Turkey could have purchased F-35s as well but decided they were too costly and wanted to purchase soviet S400 anti air systems instead which were a lot cheaper and of more importance to Turkey at the time when presented with the ultimatum to choose one or the other.
Greece and Turkey will never get along, but they're not going to go to war either.
Turkey would like to eventually join the EU (maybe under future leadership and further separation of church and state, this may eventually be possible) and both are current members of NATO so most of their bickering remains rhetoric.
I feel like there's a bit of a disconnect with most westerners sentiments towards Turkey and its leadership right now.
Erdogen is at real risk of not being reelected.
The opposing party wants a more secularized government and they are holding Erdogen responsible for the economy/inflation.
There's a lot of domestic issues right now over there and this Sweden/Finland stunt is being used as a bargaining chip by current leadership as a means of trying to stay in power.
Watch how quickly things change in May once the elections take place.
It's clear that Turkey is trying to manipulate the situation by making its support for NATO expansion conditional on the F-16 deal.
It's important for the international community to stand together and not be swayed by such tactics.
