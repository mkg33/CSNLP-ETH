Basically Kremlin is made of 70 year old fossils that don't understand tech at all.
They would probably have banned or taken CCP-style total control Telegram if they had a clue, but they were just too illiterate to prevent sabotage and easily persuaded by the tech industry leaders; now it's too late, Telegram's current form is as irreplaceable as the Bolshoi ballet.
Then the younger generation of elites that is trying to compete for the power that frees up whenever Putin's circle dies out (Medvedev, Prigozhin, etc) has figured out how to use Telegram for its own purposes.
Unllike China, they are missing the middle ground of technically proficient pro-censorship officials that could actually take full control the platform.
Little different when it’s a publicly traded company.
Not a whole lot anyone can do about saudis buying stock.

Yea I get what they are saying lol that why I added directly or indirectly.
His favorite mom and pop store might be selling him products backed indirectly by saudis lol.
