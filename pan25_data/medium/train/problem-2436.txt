I can only imagine the horror of being a soviet solder, not wanting to be there, hearing stories of farmers with rifles picking Soviets off one by one, only to hear the forest howling with some very freaky shit.
Your reminder that Russia won the Winter War and Finland had to give up a large amount of it's territory.
EDIT: Damn the downvotes for stating a fact.
Yes the Finns fought valiantly, but the Finnish military was days, possibly hours away from complete collapse when peace was brokered.
The Winter War is often pushed as a war where the Giant Russia was repulsed by the small but defiant Finland, but given the situation on the ground, it's more comparable to Ukraine peacing out right now and losing all occupied territory to Russia.
If that happened, it would be a costly, but sound, Russian victory.
Another point brought up was the comparison of Russian losses to Finnish losses.
While Russia did lose like 10x the men, they were not decimated like the Finns were.
Infact just a few years later, they were the greatest land force in the world by sheer number of men.
