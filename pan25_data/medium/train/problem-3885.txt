“Socialism always fails” is the default, pre-programmed response pretty much any American is triggered to say upon hearing the word socialism without having and definition for failure or success.
Take for instance how Capitalism is responsible for between 1.1 and 3 trillion deaths since the British Empire but no one seems to care.
Or how market economies and the profit motive have destroyed our ecosystems beyond repair and have wiped out over 50% of pre-industrial biodiversity, a mass extermination on a multi-species scale that’s only ever happened 5 times in the history of the earth.
Or take for instance how we have more slaves today than ever in history.
How do you define success?
Lifting people out of poverty?
Over the past 40 years, 900 Million people have been lifted out of poverty, but 800 million of which were Chinese.
So does that count as a success for planned economies over capitalist economies???
Do you take into account metrics like life expectancy, literacy rate, malnutrition, post secondary education, unemployment numbers, average calories eaten per day, and rate of homelessness?
Because for that metric, socialist countries outperform 9 out of 10 capitalist counterparts at equal levels of development in all those areas.
Here in Venezuela, our currency, the Bolivar (suffix depending on how many zero's have been taken out due to rampant inflation) has lost all its value and continues to lose it vs the US Dollar.
The militia associated with the government kill dissidents in broad daylight and the printed money is not worth shit, you can literally find it in garbage cans.
