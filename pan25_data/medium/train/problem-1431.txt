Two mass shootings over the last weekend in my state.
But everyone seems numb to it.
It's fucked up russia is brainwashing their citizens.
But we also must make sure we don't get brainwashed about gun violence.
That's something you can actually do besides complain about Russia on Reddit.
Those were my thoughts when making that post.
Bro u need to watch some Fox news and how they celebrated that kid who went to Wisconsin.
Didn't know u were one of those "USA could never do wrong" people.
the usa establishment has done a pretty good job on normalizing mass shootings, and the use of police force against any dissent.
my biggest concern is how absolutely brainwashed overwhelming majority of Russians are right now.
They live in a completely different world, separated from reality.
Imagine actually believing what you wrote.
The only way the situations would be comparable would be if the USA news media was constantly celebrating mass shooting as beautiful things and cheering on the shooters as heroes and directly encouraging viewers to go out and commit more mass shootings.
I think you know that's not true.
