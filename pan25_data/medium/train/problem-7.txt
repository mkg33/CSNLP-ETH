I wouldn't say they are fascist, but there are still very recent cases of aboriginal land being destroyed for coal mining.
This combined with Aussie cops arresting peaceful climate protesters while being buddy buddy with people at white supremacist Rallys makes me feel like they might be moving that way.
Nearly all of the countries media is owned by Murdoch, and I feel like their politics and the general civilian consensus on such issues is reflective on this.
(for context, I am from New Zealand not America).
“Imagine your brain is like a ski resort.
There’s all different levels of slopes but most neurons do the same runs everyday, so neurons don’t carve trails through the backcountry or under the tree runs.
When you take a hallucinogenic, it’s like fresh powder on the mountain.
The neurons can’t see the trail as clearly, so they feel confident to run a new trail and explore the possibilities.
These new trails can link up with old forgotten trails and help other neurons travel down the mountain.”.
So in nerve damage patients.
Hallucinogenics work to ease pain and in some cases numbness/paralyses by firing neurotransmitters to forgotten nerve pathways.
