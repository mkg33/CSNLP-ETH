How about learning what nuance is?
I'm not Pro-china and I don't support an invasion of Taiwan (Doubt it will actually happen given China's military is actually pretty shit), but people need to realise that there is more then one side of a situation.
Imagine if America had a civil war tomorrow, and the losing side went to Hawaii, and 70 years later they magically stopped being America, while also simultaneously claiming all of America's territorial waters for economic reasons.
That is the situation Taiwan finds itself in, in the perspective of the Chinese.
(They also claim the South China Sea).
He's just going to say that both sides need to work on coming to a peace agreement.
Then he will say that currently the west is prolonging this war and is not committed to peace.
Maybe he gets frisky and says he supports attempts by Russia to propose peace while not stating the fact that Russia refuses to return conquered land.
Somehow I doubt that China will make the necessary change in policy towards Russia to be anything but lip service as a matter of fact he'll probably double up on his condemnation of NATO and support for Russia.
