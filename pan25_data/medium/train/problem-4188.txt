I've watched an interview with an older gay man who talked about being LGBT in the 60's and other things.
He also mentioned that absurd idea that young people seeing LGBT people would become LGBT themselves.
He said "Apparently, according to the authors of this idea, being gay or lesbian must be extremely exciting if you can become one just by looking at LGBT parade.
Makes me wonder why there aren't more gays and lesbians in the world if it's so awesome".
No it’s because they can’t keep up the expectations of modern equipment that video games present.
This way it’s much easier to convince the poor penal battalion that the Mosin with 1 loaded mag is how everyone is doing it these days.
They are probably going to get some Chinese knock off VR headsets and start training them that way.
I don't even know what the USMC has these days but as a kid our school toured a military base and this was in 2003.
They had full sized VR guns you could shoot at screens.
Kind of like a light gun on crack.
I imagine the military has a lot better ones these days.
