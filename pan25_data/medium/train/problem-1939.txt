We should probably rehabilitate the use of the word to what it means, if we want to understand anything at all.
Its been thrown around like a used towel.
No.
It isn't.
As much as I dislike the core recognisable tenets of ultra-traditional and reactionary movements (like fascism was), it pertains to paradoxically individualistic messianic cults, and is by definition anti-establishment.
If there's any one redeeming feature from early fascism it's actually the revolutionary stance it takes against the establishment, and even the persecution it perpetuates.
Fascism is a definite ideology and social movement in history.
We keep conflating an amorphous authoritarian system without legitimate support, like Russia is right now, and fascism.
That serves nobody's purpose.
I have read your source.
Unfortunately it has as much validity as a Wikipedia page.
Sorry.
Its a hysteria piece with very little value to trying to define or analyse fascism as a movement.
You're just ignoring my source so I'm gonna stop replying, fascism is a well established definition, as per my source, you're free to believe whatever you would like however.
Most of the points are neither necessarily connected to fascism (even more it's early signs which are even contradictory in some respects), nor is it definitive of any one ideology.
They're just an expression of state authoritarianism and populism.
A massive brain drain, fleeing of suitable candidates for drafting, and of course the moral win in taking Russia's "undesireables" with open arms had always in my book been worth making it very slightly easier for a few Russian spies to cross our borders.
