Welcome to the 'What happened in your state last week' thread (a special edition this time!
), where you can post any local political news stories that you find important in the comments.
This is a weekly thread posted every Monday, in order to facilitate more discussion on local issues on /r/politics.
Since this is intended to be a thread about local politics, top-level comments that are exclusively about national issues will not be allowed.
When commenting, please include the state you're living in, and don't forget to link sources.
Also, please actually describe what happened.
Things like "I live in X, you know what happened", "Nothing happened" or "[Politician] continues to be an idiot" isn't helpful to users and will be removed.
If someone from your state made a news round-up that you think is insufficient, feel free to comment to that round-up with further news stories.
Enjoy discussion, and review before engaging with others.
Hi there, /r/politics.
Because this thread is about local politics, I'd like to reiterate that news about President Biden, Donald Trump or any other national political figure is off topic in this thread and will be removed.
Thank you, and have a good week.
Yes.
It's a 4-3 conservative court.
1 conservative is more moderate, but has not been willing to go all the way to act on gerrymandering -- he's not the one up for election though.
The former chief justice (conservative) is retiring and her seat is up for a 10 year term.
The enemy looks like it will be Dan Kelly, who was appointed to the supreme court by Scott Walker but lost badly in the April 2020 election when he was trying to extend his appointment to a full term.
It's noteworthy because Milwaukee used to regularly elect Socialist Party candidates to the Legislature and even Congress back in the early 1900s.
You have to do something like Michigan did, to effectively end gerrymandering.
A ballot initiative that creates an independent body that attempts to create fair election maps.
