Oh damn, yeah, that's pretty bad.
Seems like it was from the Opie and Anthony Show in 2005 and resurfaced last year.
I can't recall ever having heard anything similar on his podcast though it's not like he took live calls (or that I listened to every episode).
I more remember him always saying that nobody should take anything he says seriously because he's an idiot.
I was okay with that explanation for a while, but then he started to really give a huge platform to fuckheads like Alex Jones and I lost interest in listening.
I don't know how bad he's gotten since going to Spotify (and full Republican).
If he's doing shit like in that bondo clip, then fuck him.
