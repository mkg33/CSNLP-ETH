Why am I getting downvoted lol I don’t agree with these I just remember in April a verdict came out where 4 members of this group were acquitted because it was ruled as entrapment I just want to know how theses guys got charged with something I’m just curious.
The FBI didn't just randomly pick some dudes in Michigan and say "Hey...let's trick them into telling us they want to kidnap the governor!
".
Believe hes charged with more than just kidnapping.
Its important to highlight that hes going in for that long because of planning to commit terrorist acts.
We cant sugar coat these things.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Not sure how it's entrapment.
I mean, could you see yourself being tricked by the FBI into admitting you planned to kidnap a United States governor, when you were totally innocent?
