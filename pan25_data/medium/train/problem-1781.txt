Now don't get me wrong, I fully agree that for a person that is absolutely terrifying the thought of having to be basically a combat slave and have the relative safety of a Ukrainian camp be taken away from you and then be both tortured and executed.
It is immensely fucked up, but again, practically speaking he was a liability and dubious, I know I have been harping on the fact thet he was a criminal, and I understand that is bad since people can change and specially in a country like Russia you can't ever be sure if someone truly deserves their sentence, and he is still very much a person who deserves compassion.
But even so, his life is worth risking for someone (a Ukrainian in this case) who as far as we know, have done nothing wrong, and were captured for defending their family and neighbours.
The imperial guard would mostly just shoot you in the head, and leave it at that, they wouldn't even hold a public execution just execute you on the spot.
This... this is a whole other level of bad...
