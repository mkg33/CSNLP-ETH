The world knows, it's clear and constant and sanctions are at their extreme other than that there is little else we can do that won't trigger a nuclear response and having China and India undermine the sanctions.
Putin desperately needs a military response from the west to justify his whole narrative but he's not getting it as much as he has tried to provoke a confrontation.
It's up to the Russian population to try, as hard as it would be, to take a stand, but know this is easy to say under the circumstances of living under an autocratic police state.
I'm surprised that there hasn't been an actual rebellion by troops and some Generals yet.
Surely they are desperate and have had enough.
I know the families get threatened as well but this whole idea that Putin is more of a threat to their lives than Ukraine ever was must be a motivator to turn on him.
They're probably not super well equipped to begin with.
If you look at how how poorly organized the invasion has been so far, I very seriously doubt the people conducting the invasion could do any better organizing a massive rebellion.
