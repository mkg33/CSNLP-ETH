By some metrics 75% of russians "support the war" but only 25% want continuation of the war and 55% want peace talks right now.
Not "Ukranian capitulation", "peace talks."
If they support the war why they want to end it right now?
People want to be left alone and they will tell and do anything to be left alone.
Mobilization directly affected people.
You can check russian propaganda about it.
"it's only 1%" with comparison to a bag of gummy bears.
"Don't worry, it doesn't affect you.
".
Oh yeah.
There are a lot of acronyms like that in the military that totally arenâ€™t accidental.
Like the AT4 rocket launcher, for example.
It fires an 84 mm rocket.
Toooootally not an accident that 84 and AT4 sound the same.
English is my native language and our pronunciation still confounds me to no end.
I can't even imagine how difficult it is for non native speakers to learn.
Off topic I know but I mean seriously.
English is like 5 different languages hiding under a trenchcoat.
I mean I don't think English is the absolute most difficult language to learn but I'm 100% confident in saying shit like that doesn't make it any easier.
