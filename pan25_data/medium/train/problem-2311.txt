I recall playing war games with Pakistan and India that were declassified by the CIA dealing with the 70s India VS Pakistan.
And that’s why the soviets supported India during those times, because the ISI and all of Pakistan and western powers had shared interests in Afghanistan.
Exact India doesn’t really care.
You can offer to give India the F-35 and they’ll take it and still support Russia.
Their relationships with Russia data back to the Soviet Union.
If India chose to be a friend of a literally regime of communist oppression, then I highly doubt they will break from Russia now.
Why does their relationship with Russia date back to the Soviet Union?
Let’s answer that.
The USA supported Pakistan over India many times in the 20th century, so the only ally left was Soviet Union for India.
You realize that the Soviets were first to establish relations with India?
The US attempted to establish good relations as well, it India was already firmly within the Soviet sphere.
Pakistan was the 2nd choice.
