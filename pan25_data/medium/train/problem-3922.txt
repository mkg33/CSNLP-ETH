Meh, you're probably right, but both sides have been infinitely disappointing in recent years.
It's all theater to distract while corporate America gets rich quick and sucks the money straight off the printer.
Our kids are fucked.
Won't hear me argue against that.
So many Republicans simply won't trade an inch of the Second Amendment for a better life.. regardless of how much they're getting robbed literally everywhere in society.
Imagine standing with nothing but a pile of guns and saying, "This is enough for me.
This is enough for my kids future".
Doesn't help that the system emasculates the hell out of the working man by paying him less and less and then gas lighting him into thinking he, or worse his neighbor, is the problem.
The right will turn on the second amendment more and more as liberals and minorities arm themselves and their communities.
That will be a hard, dystopian af, one to watch.
And the left + police unions will applaud it.
They're all better friends behind closed doors than we'll ever know.
I agree that the real struggle is working people vs. corporations, but I feel strongly that the democrats are much more on the side of the people than the republicans.
Not to say there aren‚Äôt corporate dems; it‚Äôs probably still a 30/70 split progressive/corporate there, but the gop has gone full fascist and kicked anyone out of the party who isn‚Äôt on board.
That‚Äôs a 0/100 split in favor of oligarchs.
If dems wanted to start a revolution for working people in this country, they'd only have to back off the guns and speak their truth.
But they will never because it's bad for business.
Money printer needs to go brrrrrrrrr.
Oh wait, I deleted my account from that garbage platform months ago when it first turned to shit ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
