The impression I get is that the older generation in Russia are the ones still glued to the TV and buying the propaganda.
Apparently even in North Korea there are people hiding smartphones and quietly spreading news about what the government is up to.
The countdown has started on Putin's time left on the planet,... and he knows it.
(The real reason the fat, bloated pig shits himself.
I'm surprised Russians aren't openly ashamed that he's their "leader".
).
Can't happen soon enough.
What I really want to see is him meeting his maker in public from a shit explosion.
But I'd be happy enough if he just goes screaming in pain from the cancer that's eating him alive.
(I hope he remembers to do a nice big purge of his closest friends, first.
Just to show them the price of failing.
That would be kind of cool.
).
They sincerely believe the pig is their savior and standing up for russian pride.
And protecting russians from the evil west.
The last psycho russian i talked to kept repeating those talking points.
More than likely 2023 will be the year we see a new Russia but I fear it means even darker days for the rest of the world.
The extremism and nationalsm is driven deep into their propagandist machine and getting a black eye like they did with Ukraine will only piss the bear off even more.
