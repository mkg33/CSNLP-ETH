We’ve literally seen cases where the a judge will help out the lawyers who are doing a bad job at stating their case and then even make arguments for the lawyers in their ruling that wasn’t even an argument the lawyers made (see Trump Mar-a-lago documents case).
The Federalist Society will also seek out potential plaintiffs and file suit on their behalf (see student loan forgiveness).
It’s insane to me that the federalist society can file suits with federalist society lawyers that go to federalist society judges, that go to an appeals court with another federalist society judge and then appear before a Supreme Court which is ran by mostly federalist society judges.
The judicial system is broken beyond repair because of the record number of judges Trump was able to appoint (all federalist society recommendations).
