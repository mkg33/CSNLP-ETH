Russia has the largest stock of oil on that side of the earth and Saudi Arabia’s (1) marking up prices cause America’s(3) pull out game in oil is strong.
It’s pretty sad that Russia must stoop to slavery and human trafficking to try and make progress on the battlefield.
Few warriors of their own so they’re trying to shake down over-crowded prisons in poor countries under autocratic or corrupt regimes.
It's incredible that a country can afford to purchase other citizens before they can manage to even put their own people into battle.
Nothing makes sense.
The ANC is not naive, just viciously and systemically corrupt.
They know the institutions of South African statehood have been raped, depleted and looted by their own hands, it's just a matter of time before they lose any central authority from Pretoria, probably in the next 20 years or so.
In all seriousness, they're just taking the money, saying what Russia/China wants so long as it personally enriches them and will probably find themselves in quiet exile in 20 years.
Probably in Singapore, and never having to face the consequences of their looting of an entire country's wealth and prosperity, and still not actually throwing in and living amongst the shithole states they claim to idolise.
