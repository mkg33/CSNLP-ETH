I think if you examine the issue you’ll see that despots love “local government” because it is easy to control.
They despise the idea of higher law because it has a tendency to be able to knock them down a peg.
This has been especially true since the rise of constitutional and secular law, as empires and churches had to prop up the local strongmen since they couldn’t police the population themselves for very long.
The closer government gets to the local fatcat the more likely he is to own it.
Further, I think simply examining smaller states vs. larger ones reveals that smaller more local government hasn't got a very good track record.
I'd certainly rather have been born a citizen of the British Empire than of most modern small states.
