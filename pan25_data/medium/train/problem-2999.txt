Apparently, they're also criticizing him for visiting another country when there's so much going wrong in America.
By their "logic," the President would never be able to leave America to meet with our foreign allies since there's always something happening here.

Yes but these particular sirens had to have been staged.
America would've warned Russia that Biden was coming, to avoid any mishaps, so there's no way in hell Russia would target wherever Biden was speaking while he was there.
Of course, this is what they'd like: An America isolated from the rest of the world and allowing Russia and China to run rampant.
And if the sirens were real, then that fact that everyone ignored them and went on with the photo ops makes absolutely no sense, does it?

You generally don't hear a real air raid siren and say "okay, time to go outside for those photo ops now."
That only makes sense if the alarm isn't actually warning you of any real danger.
