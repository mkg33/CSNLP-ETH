The reality is that this could be literally anything.
Could have been the FSB accidentally/intentionally mowed down another FSB group or other RU group and is selling it to the media as competence.
Like the 3 STALKER airsoft larp’ers they killed few weeks ago and claimed were foreign agents and their “Pro-Ukrainian” unit patches were from the video game?
Unfortunately, this has been confirmed to be true.
Although they're not Ukrainian military, they're from one of the groups fighting for Ukraine.
The fact that they can only boast of catching only one group (for real and not one of their crappy staged captures) after almost a year of fighting is pretty good news to me.
Knowing Russia, they probably killed their own and then dressed them up as Ukrainians.
Russia can't get anything right and it is showing in this war that they started.
Yes but also depends where they grew up.
I grew up in Donetsk in the 90s and it was heavily Russian speaking and I’m gonna say determining that difference with such a mixing pot would be borderline impossible.
