With the staggering rise in bird flu (H5N1) cases globally, especially in China, I might be worried about zoonotic transmission along their shared boarder.
Low wildlife and food scarcity could make dead birds an appealing meal plan, which could create the perfect conditions for mutations that enable human to human transmission of H5N1.
In 2025 they'll probably denounce Russia's attack on Ukraine and in 2030 the Leader will officially say North Korea has always supported capitalism.
No offense taken I've seen the product of that nation (from the DMZ).
North Korea is the definition of a failed state.
They don't even produce food for their people, let alone a contribution to the planet.
So, their lockdown essentially changes nothing It's honestly very sad.
In case you're wondering why they're saying "respiratory disease" and not COVID.
It is possible that they're dealing with something else, but I imagine it's probable that they're not saying COVID for PR reasons because they already claimed to eradicate it.
