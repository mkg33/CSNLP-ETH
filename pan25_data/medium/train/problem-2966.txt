Russia is huge.
I’m sure there’s plenty of ways to make up for that fossil fuel revenue stream.
Like large greenhouse operations, mining, manufacturing, water transfers are really going to be big in the next few decades I’m sure.
$300 million per day would be a devastating blow for Russia.
They'd lose $109 billion per year and Russia isn't a particularly rich country, that'll hurt.
Well to he honest even at $60 per barrel they can keep going for ever, given that their gas/oil infrastructure can be serviced (big if).
But theoretically they can pay for this war with the current sanction levels.
From a purely mathematical perspective, since Russia has a GDP of roughly 1.7 trillion USD their reserves would end in around 16 years if they were to lose 109 billion USD per year.
But that's just a theoretical calculation, in reality I doubt they could last more than a decade losing that much money.
He had all the opportunities in the world.
And he decided it would be way easier to fk with a neighboring country.
