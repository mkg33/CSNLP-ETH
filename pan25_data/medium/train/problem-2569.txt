There's a huge difference between visa-free access and Schengen.
With Schengen you basically have no hard border, anyone can cross anytime with ease, and any checks in importing/exporting, visas, or identity to enter the area need to be done by the country a person or shipment of goods enter the Schengen area through.
The whole area is therefore subject to the standards of the weakest version in the agreement, and it will take a long time before Ukraine can demonstrate their up to the standard the other countries in the agreement will accept.
At best Ukraine can expect Customs Union in 2 years.
5 years-ish after that single market.
A further 3 years full EU membership and possibly Schengen.
The EU would need to ‘drive the boat’ for a few years to ensure it won’t just collapse under their feet.
Ukraine should also be wise that if they do get their wish in 2 years though overly optimistic it is, they should do well to protect their agricultural industry and gas/oil from outside private investors who only want to profit, the locals be damned.
