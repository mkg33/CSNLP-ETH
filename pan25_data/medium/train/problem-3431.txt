There's an ad in Italy, for ENI ( one of the biggest oil and gas company here ) that basically goes into how they're trying to be better for the environment and recycling and are "asking" us to do the same with the motto "ENI+Silvia ( just a random name) is better than ENI".
I suggest, instead of scapegoating a 19 year old and joining sides with companies like ExxonMobil who have accurately predicted global warming since the 1970's... maybe stand behind the message and not shoot the messenger ü§î.
The Petroleum sector in Canada does the same thing.
Over the last several years they've been pushing hard on this image that they're somehow the "good" guys relative to global oil companies and constantly pretend that their mild interest in carbon capture can offset their BS.
Anyone with a working braincell can tell right through it.
Edit: see comment below about the origin of the carbon footprint.
I didn‚Äôt state it clearly that what BP did was adopt and present/position the carbon footprint, rather than invent it.
I thank the response below as I don‚Äôt want to further propagate misunderstanding.
Also, don‚Äôt want to imply that the consumer does not have responsibility in this matter, just that campaigns like this are common and tend to be public displays of good intent to avoid being held publicly accountable.
Also, (related but not specific to this discussion) the whole idea of a person‚Äôs ‚Äúcarbon footprint‚Äù was developed (edit: should say positioned) by Oglivy & Mather (ad agency) for BP, specifically to deflect the onus to combat climate change onto the consumer rather than the industry.
