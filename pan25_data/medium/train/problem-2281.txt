Donald Trump proved himself to be a fucking rube who acted tough on Twitter, but actually got rolled in negotiations with many of our enemies (see Helsinki).
Helsinki wasn’t a “negotiation” - it was a test set by Putin, one where that Trump was required to publicly denounce his own security services in the most public way possible.
He literally had every security agency tell him that Putin did it, and Trump said otherwise at the summit.

Chris Steele (he of Steele dossier) says this was one of a series of tests/checkboxes that Putin gave Trump and should he complete them, two things would happen:
1, an eye watering sum of money split over many bank accounts in various countries would be released to Trump.
According to steele, the pee tape is extremely low on the list of things they have on trump.
It’s stuff like sex tourism in multiple places where you pay to do horrible things to trafficked women and that he owed fortunes to people you would never do business with let alone borrow money off.
