GDP is a funny measure to use during war because war creates demand on the broken window model.
If my house burns down three times, and I rebuild it three times, each time a little shittier, in GDP terms I've had a very productive year.
The real thing you want to know is if the average Russian is wealthier or poorer in terms of purchasing power than they were last year.
Also, the ruble was propped up last year.
When the war first started, it collapsed, but then they pumped a bunch of cash into the system to prop it up.
That cash is now starting to run out.
The ruble just recently fell below pre-war levels and shows no signs of leveling off.
Without the cash, there's only so much they can do with accounting to hide it.
It's going to turn to shit this year.
Also added to this is that war causes a decline in population.
Thousands to the war, thousands to prison, thousands to internal conflicts, and thousands to mental illness caused by all the other effects.
If the decline is significant enough then in theory the purchasing power per person may not actually change much as fewer people results in each person having more purchasing power.
