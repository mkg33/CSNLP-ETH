I never understood how these election deniers thought they had a winning argument.
Let's think about this logic for a moment.... Joe Biden won Arizona in 2020 because more people voted for him.
The Republicans threw a hissy fit, lied about fraud, and tried to invalidate votes/overthrow the government.
So.... Kari Lake thought ANY of those voters were going to forget that and vote for her?
If I lived in Arizona and had voted for Biden, how could I possibly accept a governor who won't accept my vote?
This is why they use the term illegitimate.
They are literally signaling that they view every vote not for the GOP as illegitimate.
You better believe if they could they would codify that in law.
Believe the fascist when they tell you who they are through "jokes.
".
They never believed there was a good argument for Trump.
They just saw his supporters and wanted their support.
They miscalculated; Trump never had as many supporters as it seemed, they were just VERY LOUD.
Maybe I'm being unfair by assuming the candidates are simply repeating the fraud lies to lock in MAGA votes rather than sincerely believing there was fraud (even though no proof of widespread fraud exists).
Although, you'd think someone running for statewide office would want to have their facts straight about this sort of thing before offending every voter that cast their ballot for Biden.
