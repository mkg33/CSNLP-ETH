The author of this article needs some remedial English lessons if they’re going to be writing in English.
Even after all that text I understand the situation no more clearly than after I read the headline.
So anyway, the full story is that Elon sent a company wide email demanding that all engineers and employees come back to the office that day or call and explain why they can't immediately drop everything and get on a plane.
This woman ignored the email, since she is an executive level employee and is based in Ireland, where workers have legal protections against such petulant and arbitrary employment practices.
Also, her NOT being fired might allow Twitter to continue operating in the EU… assuming she actually has access to her email, phone and office.
Since she did not respond to the email, the IT team revoked her access and locked her out of her office, in Dublin, where such conduct is prohibited.
She filed an injunction against Twitter to prevent them firing her without notice or cause, and Twitter's response was to claim it was a mistake and that she wasn't fired.
