Not only that but the investment firm that made the allegations probably pre-planned their shorts so they just made shit ton of money too.
Everyone knows that Adani has huge debts and the investment firm used it to their favor to short the stocks worldwide and make profits.
Shorting is a valid and necessary market mechanism precisely for these kind of situations.
I wouldn't let your disdain for short positioned investment strategies to muddy the water here.
If it turns out to be bullshit then they could be liable for market manipulation or defamation or whatever the equivalent is.
If it turns out to be true then it begs the question who else would have revealed this fraud?
It seems that this is “nobody right when everybody wrong” situation.
It is almost certain that the Indian billionaire have some “skeletons in the closet”… but the fact that this skeletons unearth by company which specializes in short selling… does not smell right.
If company A involved into nefarious activity, I feel that it is wrong for company B make money by exposing this… FBI (or local equivalent) should investigate and punish responsible parties.
Yeah I agree with the last part but let's be honest it's quite often institutional corruption that enables fraud on this scale to be successful.
It's a sad state of affairs really.
I don't think the Indian govt is investing in Adani's companies.
If Adani falls, someone else will step in to run airports.
While Modi is buddy-buddy with Adani, your comment makes no sense whatsoever.
The fraud is to be investigated by the securities board, and Modi has not played any part in keeping it a secret.
