I don't think you understand, this was not in some flatland with nearby roads, this was Alaska.
Have you ever been to Alaska?
Do you know what Alaska looks like?
What happens if you drop a keyboard from thousands of feet in the air?
Can you find it?
Do you believe the U.S. military can magically find it?
No, it will require enormous, expansive search parties that may take weeks.
If the U.S. says it may never be recovered, it means the U.S. doesn't believe it's important enough to dedicate the manpower to find it at all cost.
Which means either it is lying because, say, they have been told since that it was a Canadian or US weather balloon or something, or some other analysis came in that posits that the object couldn't have been used for any particularly high-tech surveillance.
Conspiracy theorists seem to think the military is uniformly like, on top of their shit and super duper capable but the reality is that, just with any large organization, some elements are just there to jerk themselves off and get a paycheck while others are stupidly good at their job and always go the extra mile.
