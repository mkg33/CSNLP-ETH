and you have Top Republicans, Beautiful Republicans, and they're not caving against me to the Radical Left, who only want to hurt us and hurt Religion and take away your Bible and your 2nd Amendment.
you know we never had more Guns than we did under Trump, you had the NRA, they were begging me, "please, Sir, save our Constitution," and I said I'll think about it, and now they're calling me nonstop, "Sleepy Joe is killing us, we're Dead in the Market," so I went, did this, did that, did that, and now you have a lot more, a lot more, and instead of Phony Investigations That Go Nowhere, they should be looking more closely into Hunter and Sleepy Joe, and what Obama and Crooked Hillary were doing to Steal The Election, but the Fake News won't talk about it.
The Republicans are all about telling people they're for the working class, telling people they're fiscally responsible, telling people that they have plans for health care and inflation and infrastructure, and telling people they're tough on China and Russia.
