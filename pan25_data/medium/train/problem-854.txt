sooner the russian government is toppled the sooner all these wrongly arrested people can be released.
as ordinary citizen thousands of miles away from the shitshow that is the russia and their bullshit war, i can only read and watch the news and sigh...
Russia has existed as a nation for over a thousand years, and it has been some type of authoritarian dictatorship for all but eight of those years.
As much as I'd like to see them become a peaceful, free democracy, I'm not holding my breath.
when will it all end?
are ukraine any closer to making a big push anywhere, like crimea or the east ?
I think something is gonna happen soon.
The US just told all of its citizens to GTFO Russia immediately, which is off timing and stronger than the typical advisories from the U.S. State Dept.
There’s supposed to be an announcement on 2/24.
Not currently, no.
At the moment Russia is on the offensive and the only scenario where a decisive Ukrainian „big push“ can happen is if the Russians get completely decimated (and the western arms deliveries kick in in time).
