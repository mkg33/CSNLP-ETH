Pressure on healthcare systems?
Buddy, I worked bedside during 2020 and my wife still currently does, all in Pulmonology.
Here in the States, this pressure isn’t due to just COVID, but flu and RSV.
Why is RSV running mad?
Because everybody is wearing mask for three years and our immune system got “dumber.” Now babies are getting sick so fast, nobody has room for them.
RSV is actually a killer for them.
For us it’s sniffles, mostly.
They get protection via mommy’s antibodies and herd immunity.
Ya know, that stuff that doesn’t exist anymore because God Fauci says so.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
