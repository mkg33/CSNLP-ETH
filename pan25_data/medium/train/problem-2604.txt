Oh good, I didn't realize he was in Supermax.
I was going to say "Nope, into the hole with you," but I guess he's already there.
Of course he wants to go home.
The one thing Pablo Escobar truly feared was extradition to the United States.
With Supermax being so insanely secure do you think the cartel even attempted to come up with a break out plan?
Would love to see that one sketched out on a napkin.
If you'd ever seen it, you'd understand why no one would attempt it.
I've driven by many times.
Not only could they see you coming from miles off, you'd have to fight through one medium security prison to get to the gate of ADX.
Once inside there are tons of security features that would also make getting hands on a guard damn near impossible, bulletproof glass and secure rooms, stuff like that.
But even if you managed all of that, you've now started a war in a valley of CO. As mentioned by others, CO Springs has quite the military presence, and I'd imagine DOD/Homeland Security would have something to say about the Battle at ADX.
This is good advice for anyone, Iâ€™ve been trying to yell at all my friends, particularly the non Star Wars fans, how good it is.
