It's actually quite simple.
The term scandiniavia (or something similar) was an ancient word for southern Sweden (roughly).
It was brought back into usage in the 1800s and popularized by the scandinavist movement who wanted to unite Sweden, Norway, and Denmark based on our shared culture, language, and history.
That's pretty much it.
There's no other reason.
Finns weren't included as they are a completely different ethnic group.
But Iceland does have similar culture and are descendants of vikings and norsemen.
So why not Iceland?
Well Iceland (as a country) didn't exist back then and was just a colony, not part of Denmark proper.
It's a bit like Åland which is full of ethnic swedes but belong to Finland.
It's understandably confusing because of the nordic countries close ties, but it's pretty obvious when you understand the origin of the word and why it was created (or recreated/reintroduced).
They got the Bosphorus that ain’t happening, and Erdogan aside Turkey’s been fighting alongside the US in our shitty wars in one way or another for over 70 years now.
