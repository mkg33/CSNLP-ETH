It's one of the biggest military forces in the world.
They can throw a lot more in this stupid invasion.
They still have thousands of tanks and aircraft units and if they fully mobilize they could call more than a million people.
It's also known that many of their units are outdated and not very effective against modern counterparts.
And their soldiers aren't well equipped.
I'm not an expert but I imagine Russia won't count on deploying the more ancient tank units to make up for the losses.
They've already pulled some older tanks from museums to use because the ones in the museum were in better shape than what they had stored.
Their pilots get maybe half the air time that Ukrainian pilots get, and they've been seen to use things like GPS unit from the shops because the planes are not equipped with that.
A lot of Russian corruption went into the neglect of military materials and things like buying cheap Chinese tires instead of stronger well built tires for their heavy trucks.
and in cases where they have state of the art things, like planes, they dont have the munitions to go with it, like precision guided bombs for its bombers, leading for them to do low bombing runs using conventional weapons, and get them shot down because now they are in range of modern manpads...
