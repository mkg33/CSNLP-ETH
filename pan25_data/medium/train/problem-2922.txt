Iâ€™m actually impressed Republicans are still conceding instead of following the Trump playbook of throw a shit fit, threaten to sue anyone and everyone involved in the electoral process, and whip your fanbase in to a murderous fury.
This midterm was a wide rebuke of Trumpism everywhere that isn't FL (and maybe AZ/NM).
Leaning into that would only damage their chances down the road.
