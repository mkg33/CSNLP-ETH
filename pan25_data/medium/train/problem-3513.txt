nah, not even ripping down a poster.
standing in front of a poster for a few minutes so nobody can see it.
as soon you walk away, everything is like nothing happend.
any idiot can do it, yes.
you can just give people a bit of money and they will ddos targets for you.
requires zero knowledge about anything computer related.. just money.
it's pathethic that this days hacking is often just ddos.
As far as I know, DDoS is the molotov cocktail of computer attacks, any idiot can do it with software you can easily download.
Trying to show this is a government attack would be difficult at best.
It really could just be some angry Russian teenagers.
just doesn't really has the same effect in my opinion.. because in a riot or protests, many people show what they think about something.. and it has a big effect because its so much people.
but in a ddos.. it is usually just a really small group of people trying to "damage" something.. even if they know that it will lead to nowhere.
but often its for a specific reason (not liking your government, a decision, a specific person etc.)
and with a big group of people just like in a protest.
in a riot, there are still many people who are mad about / against something or someone.
in a ddos its often just a tiny group of a few people doing it.
i wouldn't call it as an example a riot if 2 people go into a starbucks and wreck harvoc in there.
