California has to undo prop 13 so that it can collect taxes and stop trying to nickel and dime businesses and people with fees and bs permits to make money and fund the government.
Every government fee is an additional cost that a business will pass on to consumers.
Like does Cali really need a sign telling you everything you see gives you cancer?
I don't think so.
Yes, a prop 13 repeal is interesting to think about.
The net effect is mostly shifting what would be state revenue into higher mortgage payments.
I guess the practical implementation there would be a phase-out over time to prevent shocking the market.
What a hornetâ€™s nest that would be, though.
