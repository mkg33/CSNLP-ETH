The wording was a deliberate attempt at rage bait against our nurses in the U.K.. OP is u/TheTelegraph, so it’s also shameless self-promotion.
To provide context, the Telegraph is nicknamed “The Torygraph” in the U.K., because of their constant shilling and bootlicking of the Tory party (the pejorative nickname for the Conservatives, the U.K.’s …right-leaning main political party) and their political lines.
The Tories are notoriously anti-worker, so any excuse to promote hatred towards any worker, including our own nurses - the same nurses they were celebrating and clapping for just a year ago, will be immediately jumped on by these clown shoes.
To provide additional context, our nurses union, the Royal College of Nursing, has decided for the first time in its over-100 year history that nurses will strike soon.
Does anyone know where i can get (free, of course) decent cryptic crosswords without having to wade through "news"?
(Im not the sharpest tool in the box so telegraph level crosswords challenge me 🤷🏼).
My claim about the for the Telegraph?
It’s apparently been in the Urban Dictionary lexicon since 2011.
(These are good natured, preemptive responses to your question.
I hope they don’t come across as combative and aggressive as I fear.
😅).
