Wasn't Yoon known on the campaign trail to promise military escalation with the north?
I for one would rather not see open conflict in the Joseon peninsula again, the Korean people have seen enough of the hardships of the world these past two hundred yesrs.
There’s also the double standard issue.
I mean, how ridicolous would it be if I went around internet saying that men definitely make better leaders than women, and anyone who disagrees with me is a man-hating sexist.
Would be pretty dumb.
We all would like to think that.
And if I was younger I’d agreed.
But woman are still human.
And humans act differently once they are in that position.
You don't know shit.
I'm ex-Navy.
It's been proven time and time again that women in command make calmer more level-headed decisions in the face of potential threat.
I suspect this thread will just end up full of BS comments from misogynist dinosaurs.
Not trying to be misogynistic, just unbiased.
While for example my own country’s prime minister is a woman, and does a fantastic job imo, that doesn’t make claims like ”women make better leaders because i’ve seen it” any less biased.
Nor does the fact that the comment chain is currently decked with names of terrible female leaders, while you couldn’t provide a single name of the opposition.
If you want to see men and women as equals, i suggest you start to treat then as equals, instead of this gender-segregation-bullshit you’ve got going.
