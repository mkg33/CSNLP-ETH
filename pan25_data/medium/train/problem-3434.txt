EDIT: Also, yeah, why the fuck did she call it "Simena's Respect for Marriage Act" as if she created it?
Even the Republicans she mentioned working with are listed as co-sponsors but she isn't?
Is she just terrible at paperwork and forgot to write her name on it?

Please if you have any questions or concerns.
This just shows how empty and baseless the attacks against her are.
Time and time again she gets historic bills passed greatly advancing Democratic goals and yet she's still met with vitriol.
Democrats have been trying and failing to get infrastructure, gun violence prevention, manufacturing and marriage equality passed for decades and Sinema has been critical to getting all of them passed in her first term as Senator.
If anyone else, like Sanders, had accomplished what she has people would be cheering them on.
The starkest example of this is the difference in treatment between Kelly and Sinema.
The two Arizona Senators are the same politically and have voted with Biden the exact same amount of times.
His victories are the same as hers, since they were part of the same bipartisan negotiations and she has additional wins that he wasn't a part of.
They support similar policies and have similar donors.
Yet Kelly, a straight male, gets cheered and people rooting for his reelection, yet Sinema, an openly LGBT woman, gets met with hate and vitriol.
