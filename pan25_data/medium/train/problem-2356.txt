No you made that up.
And The IAEA which is mostly US controlled is looking for answers about samples of sites dating back to the early 2000s long before the JCPOA was in effect.
Probably a good thing considering that the protestors (whose views can be seen in places like r/NewIran and comment threads here) think that the nuclear deal legitimizes the government, and that there should be no compromise with it as long as it is killing protestors.
The Trump administration certified Iran's compliance twice in 2017 before pulling out in May of 2018.
Even as late as 2019 after the US withdrawal the IAEA certified compliance.
You can make up whatever BS story you like, but it doesn't change the facts.
At this point it seems over and done with.
However I'm pretty sure the US public will not go in on another middle east war so there aren't a lot of options.
The US killed the nuclear deal.
Why should Iran think they wouldn't kill the next one?
Fool me once ....... Also Biden had the chance to resurrect the original deal when he got into office.
He refused to do it, opting to push for more concessions.
That's how we got here Trump, followed by Biden.
