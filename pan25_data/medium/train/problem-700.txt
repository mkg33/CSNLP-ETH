Yes a million times yes.
But me saying give back the aid doesn't force anyone to give it back.
And in recent past India never asked for aid.
You just send it to improve " civil liberties and human rights " which is kind of like subtle espionage.
It has nothing to do with the government.
So feel free to ask any NGO's you gave money to return it too.
And I acted like US supported India's enemies when ever we really needed help.
Which is true.
USA stood with our enemies , pressured us to give away our territories , Tried to blackmail us with naval blockades and nuclear strikes , put us on embargos and sanction lists , gave military aids to our enemies, gave aid to NGOs to destabilize our democracy and tried to stop infra projects through NGOs that USA gave aid and now USA want us to abandon a friendly nation that stood with us all these bad times while USA gave aid to our enemies less than 6 months ago?
Where should we sign up for that ,massa ?
That's not true.
We have always bought weapons from multiple sources.
Although yes, Soviet Union/Russia make up the big chunk.
