No one forced him to do what he did, and no one forced him to run from the consequences in such a way that his motives could be questioned to this extent.
You're right, no one forced him to stand up for the rights of the American people.
He did that on his own, knowing the potential consequences.
I mean, what else is he going to do?
He fled prosecution in the US and is living in Russia.
It's not like he's going to say he hates them.
He's focused on self preservation.
The guy is in a fucked spot and the US put him there.
I don't believe for a second he supports the war in Ukraine or any other of Putin's bull, but thanks to the shitty rich people in power he can't come home.
He exposed a wide-reaching intelligence program then ran into the arms of the US’ longstanding strategic enemy, handed said intel to them, and now is swearing allegiance to them in the midst of Russias program of genocide and invasion.
Now as a “leftist” you might find all of that totally acceptable, but even you should understand how incredibly suspicious that should make anyone not wearing ideological blinders.
