Biden's decision to force workers back to work is a litmus test if you're a tribalist or if you base your opinions on the policy and not the person.
one thing people here have a hard time grasping is you can criticize Joe Biden.
You don't have to think everything he does is great or even just bare minimum acceptable.
If you have to side with someone side with the workers.
Don't side with people who make so much money they don't even understand the basics of your life.
Besides that, yeah.
Though the only people I hear grumbling about the workers and this whole situation are people that for sure are out of touch rich assholes, many that hold some sort of managerial position.
And ofc are usually on the older side.
But, do you honestly believe if the Biden would have vetoed a bill that added the seven sick days if it had passed both the House and the Senate?
Biden was pushing for the brokered deal (which did include one personal day per year) not out of ideology, or personal vanity, but because he believed it was more likely to pass through the Senate.
Agree with him or not, he was doing what he thought was on balance best for the country as a whole.
