ITT: People who didn't read the article, and so believe that teens will be allowed to undergo sex reassignment surgery.
People don’t understand that they are not simply letting kids and teenagers legally change their gender or letting doctors give them gender hormone treatment.
Most of the time it has to be diagnosed when they are young (like 8-10 years old) and then they observe them for close to a decade before they decide to actually move forward.
Being transgender is not some simple, quick process like the haters want you to believe.
You spend significantly more time diagnosing than treating it because obviously they (doctors and patients) don’t want to get it wrong.
All this BS about kids wanting to change gender then getting surgery and a name change a week later is just propaganda.
It literally takes years to a decade for any meaningful progress to be made on an individual’s transition.
It's also key to understand that the treatments are far more effective when giving before puberty.
That causes them to have to struggle far less with transition later in life, which is really the main reason they have to even address the issue so young vs wait until they are 18 and can just decide for themselves entirely.
