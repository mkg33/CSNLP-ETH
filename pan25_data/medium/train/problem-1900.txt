Republicans are banning drag shows, reducing the rights of trans people in different ways, and it will likely get worse.
Why?
Ostensibly in some places to "save the children".
No, really.
Despite trans behavior having nothing at all to do with risks to children.
Republicans champion the right to bear arms.
Being shot is now THE leading cause of death in children.
But that freedom to bear arms is so very important, the lives of our children can be sacrificed.
And are.
They're lying.
Republicans attack minorities to divide them from each other.
We need to stick together on this.
We're all human.
