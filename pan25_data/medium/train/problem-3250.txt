I do have sympathy for them.
I'll be the first to admit that sympathy has little practical application beyond desiring Ukraine's military forces to treat prisoners humanely but I do have sympathy for them.
They are fed lies and they in turn are being fed into a meat grinder all for little more than a sop to Putin's bizarre paranoia.
The dude is so trapped in the Soviet notion of buffer states and spheres of influence he can't stop himself.
He hasn't noticed that the rest of the world basically doesn't even care that Russia exists.
Who the fuck would ever want to invade Russia?
What does he think he's defending his kingdom from?
This is typical.
In a totalitarian regime blame is usually pinned on the people who happen to be at the bottom of the pecking order, in this case conscripts, to save those higher up the power ladder.
The company commander likely has no real experience and when he realized he screwed up and displeased his superiors, he attempted to save his sorry ass by using his conscripts as a scapegoat and denying he ordered the retreat.
