pretty much all the brands who said they left russia are still doing business with russia don't kid yourself... just using shell companies and different brand name... you can still find addidas, Nike, the latest iphone, french cosmetics, etc... so i really doubt this list is even accurate, if there is money to be made they will find a way to grab it.
The two companies in the thumbnails are pharmaceutical companies.
As much as I am against the invasion of Ukraine, the withholding of life saving medication would be barbaric.
Moreover, it would strenhen Putin’s narrative about the West and hurt any remaining support that exists from the Global South.
It is a better description than third world (there is no longer a Soviet Union), developing countries (some of these countries meet the definition of developed), or emerging (purely economic).
What term would you use?
I assume you don’t have a business background.
True withdrawal of operations means closing shop and taking a loss in a certain region, not outsourcing it to an LLC and continuing to profit from it with a good PR cover.
There’s no reason for continued business.
It’s been a year, any business on humanitarian grounds should have been substituted with products sourced elsewhere.
The countries are very well sorted geographically.
Basically only Australia and New Zealand don’t geographically fit the Global South mold.
If I understand you correctly, you think I should have called the countries Third World countries.
This of course would not include China, which is included in the Global South.
The opinion of China is pretty critical in this conflict.
It would change the meaning of my statement and make it less clear if I used the term Third World.
If you come up with a better suggestion I’m open to it.
