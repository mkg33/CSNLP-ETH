I honestly think this pandemic will go quick.
Hospitals will fill quickly and massive death tolls will follow shortly after.
It'll really boil down to who got their vaccine and wore a mask and washed their hands early on.
The people who don't like listening to the government tell them to wear masks and stay home will just weed themselves out.
They'll throw a bird flu party followed by several funerals.
Don't worry, bro We're at the stage where everything is going to be just fine with just a little simple human cooperation.
“This global spread is a concern,” he said.
“We do need globally to look at new strategies, those international partnerships, to get on top of this disease.
If we don’t solve the problem across the globe, we’re going to continue to have that risk.”.
No way.
I'm sure we'll unify and defeat this together by masking up, taking precautions, and getting an updated flu vaccine.
No one will get weird about it, everyone will support one another through the crisis, and do their part.
