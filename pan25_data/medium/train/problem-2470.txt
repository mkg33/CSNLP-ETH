The only bright spot is ironically in Seattle where the GOP picked up the city attorneys race (yahoo!)
but only because the far left candidate was such a boorish asshole.
She literally went on Twitter every day tweeting nasty attacks at every person and reporter who asked a fair question.
She ran on a platform of "abolition", which essentially meant that she wasn't going to perform the job of enforcing misdemeanors in a city rife with property crime.
This position has reasonable questions associated with it like "How will this stop property crime?"
She was absolutely a mini-Trump and only lost 50-49.5.
So even the one win is extremely qualified and she'll likely be voted out by a non-polemical candidate next election.
