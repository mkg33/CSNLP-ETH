I've only just started wrapping my brain around the process, and I'd say it's tough but doable.
Takes about 3 years minimum as a permanent resident to naturalize and have a choice to even go for citizenship.
I have a long term Canadian SO and work remotely for a global employer who is willing to play ball with the tax liability, so it's a bit easier to obtain permanent residency - just takes a long time and is about 1300 dollars or so(give or take) to apply - you may have to consult with immigration lawyers, so on and so forth.
Other people come in through work and school visas, and Canada is hurting for workers - especially in certain sectors like the medical field.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
