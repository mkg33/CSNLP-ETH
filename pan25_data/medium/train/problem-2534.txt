I think the key is DeSantis _bragging_… unless someone asked him to prove it and he then did I don’t how he could possibly know that in reality.
Last time this whole “exodus from liberal state to conservative state” was brought up it was later determined that the flow was absolutely no different from any other year regardless of political orientation.
I think calling it harder right also is an oversimplification.
This isn't like hard right fiscal policy or foreign policy with a large persistent supporter base.
It is just conspiracy policy and my sense is its popularity already peaked under Trump and has been declining ever since... so I don't see how this is a winning play, but I'm honestly glad.
My bigger fear is a wolf in sheep's clothing.
Seems a good issue to rustle up significantly more people to not vote for him.
DeSantis needs SOME independents and democrats to vote for him.
This isn’t a great way to do that.
People keep saying he’s smart and yet this is a seemingly incredibly dumb political move at the national level.
Republicans need to be bland enough to get democrats to sit out the vote to win, going HARDER right is already shown as a losing proposition electorally.
