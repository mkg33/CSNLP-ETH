Or the supply situation is untenable and the Russians are making the logical decision?
Supply of Russian forces on the west bank of the Dnipro has been severely hampered for months now by the destruction of fixed links like the Antonovskivy Bridge.
Pontoon bridges and ferries were never going to be enough to sustain operations in Kherson in the face of an ongoing Ukrainian counteroffensive, especially since the stopgap crossings were constantly getting identified and hit by long range strikes.
To the uninformed this may appear to be a withdrawal, but actually Russian scientists have discovered the Earth is round, so they're sending their army around to attack Ukraine from behind.
As much as this is a victory for Ukraine, I'm just dreading the amount of damage the occupation forces did in the 7 months they were there.
There's already been reports of Russian forces looting the city on their way out and it wouldn't surprise me if the Ukrainians find mass graves of murdered civilians like they did in Bucha.
