There are laws prohibiting dissemination of sexual material from an ex used to harm the victim, and laws need to be crafted using the same logic to address this explosive growth in violent harassment that has zero purpose other than hoping that others who hear your words will harm your target.
Making a complete fabrication knowing that the fabrication will most likely cause a violent reaction from one or more of your content consumers needs to have consequences.
Besides being the most gutless thing you could possibly do, it needs to be regarded as an overtly violent act because that's exactly what it is.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
