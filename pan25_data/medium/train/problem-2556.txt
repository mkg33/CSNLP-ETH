there's an emu loose somewhere in Massachusetts.
unless it's been caught since I checked last.
it put me in the mind of the emu war.
can you imagine something happening like that here?
There are also hardy cactuses.
I live in the Upper Midwest in the States and I keep barrels of them outside on the deck year round.
Green bees love the flowers and the fruit is really nice, even though there are so many seeds.
Like if a strawberry was in the form of a raspberry, if you can imagine that.
they are actually some of the most cold weather tolerant cacti, with extremely hardy varieties.
They prefer full sun year round and dry weather tho, but can survive in snowy environments.
For that reason they are one of the most disperse variety of cacti.
side note, their fruit imo are delicious, and the cactus pads are a very popular food in Mexico and Central America.
TIL there's one that's hardy to zone 4, Opuntia humifusa.
These look like they might fit in well with my drainage plans on the west side of the house...
Yeah looking at it more, they probably wouldn't be happy in the north side of the house.
But they do well in in well drained soil, which makes me think they might be happy in the drainage area 3-6' from the house.
Part of me wonders if I could convince the city to let me grow them between the sidewalk and curb, but I'm not sure the dog-walkers would appreciate it.
They have both long, relatively fat and very painful needles, as well as tufts of sticky tiny needles that will never leave you.
Instead, consider planting along the entire perimeter for effective home defense .
