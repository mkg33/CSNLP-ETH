The German army used meth extensively from the begining of the war, there are even notes from officers about how quickly moral improved during the initial invasion of France once everyone had taken their Meth.
Watching the recent All Quiet on Western Front film and some inaccuracies aside, I kept thinking, holy shit this turned AH into a psychopath if he wasn't already.
Another reason is that the German army wasn't actually that mechanized.
They still relied heavily on horse drawn logistics.
And well there are gas mask for horses, its difficult to get them to move once they are on.
On the US side too, specifically in the pacific where horses and mules were better suited towards fighting through the jungle than jeeps.
Only story I got from my poppop (Italian who fled to the US to avoid Mussolini, joined the US army and ended up fighting through mainland Asia) was that at one point they were so low on supplies they ate their horses.
Horse meat is actually somewhat popular in Italian cuisine in some areas, but needless to say he said he couldnâ€™t stomach it after that incident.
