Let’s not forget Officer Brian Sicknick who LOST his life protecting the Capitol.

I think your feelings about this are entirely unjustified.
What right do you have to speak for someone else that you didn’t even know?
She lived an entire(maybe 1/2 heh) life and did enough things to define her own life for us.
She died doing what she loved-being a complete moron and getting unwarranted attention for it.
In the real world, she sacrificed herself for a literal terrorist attack.

In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
