Propaganda is an extremely effective tool, especially when given a megaphone, and most of the media on the attacking side feels no obligation to be truthful.
The MSM needs to stop "both sides"-ing this shit.
One side is responsible for the dishonest messaging and the violence that is following that messaging.
(Hint: It isn't the Dems.)
This is about a lot more than the need for the Dems to be better story tellers.
The side perpetuating the violence needs to unequivocally denounce that violence, and then it needs to back up those words with better actions.
Until that happens things will only get worse.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
