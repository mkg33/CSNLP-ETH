So I looked up Rasmus Paludan.
He's a far-right politician (though best I can tell, he holds no office) who was found guilty in Denmark for racism and defamation in 2021.
He's also held multiple Quran burnings.
He is not someone who should be taken to be a representative of Sweden.
He is absolutely just into being controversial, he does not have any political ideas or plans.
He just want to rile people up.
He was mostly ignored in the end, not in the beginning.
A suburb of my own city, Århus, had unrest for five days in a row with trashcan fires and rocks and fireworks directed at firefighters even though his protest occurred in Copenhagen at the time.
A guy from another suburb of my city was shot in the leg by police when he tried to stab Paludan.
He was also escorted away by police in a third event when he was outside a shopping mall in my city when someone tried to hit him with a car.
A part of Copenhagen, believe it was Nørrebro, had unrest and was on fire before the election 4 years ago, and that's when he had most succes as a politician.
He only reached 1.8% of the national votes, below the 2% treshold, so he was never in parliament.
He's proving that certain extremists can't be civil.
If I saw someone burning my favourite book I'll tell them they're human garbage but I'm not going to physically attack them for it.
I'm not sure if this is an attempt at a "gotcha" but you're giving another example of people I consider problematic for society.
There can be more than one extremist group which needs to be dealt with.
