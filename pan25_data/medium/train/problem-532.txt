Just a reminder that the USA declaring Russia a state sponsor of terror wouldn't be just symbolic and carries huge ramifications that would negatively affect nearly every country in the world, including most of Europe, and would make negotiations with Russia nearly impossible.
Using it against a country as big as Russia would be the political equivalent of dropping a Tsar Bomba.
This new label is likely just another step moving in that direction but the USA is going to give Russia, and the rest of the world, plenty of time to prepare for or try and prevent that from happening.
It's no coincidence that even Russian allies (Xi and Orban) suddenly came out calling for diplomacy on the eve of this announcement.
From my limited understanding, no companies in the US can do business with russia or russian companies, and any country or non US based company that does business with russia can't do business with the US.
Essentially it'll force any country that does business with both to choose between doing business with the US or russia.
