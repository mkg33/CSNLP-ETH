In this intercepted call, a Russian soldier tells his wife about a failed assault operation with no support, surviving a direct missile strike, and Russian forces "writing off" friendly fire as casualties taken from Ukrainians.
Julia Ioffe wrote in an article how (in a different country, not Ukraine) the Russian military left a Wagner group to die rather than to admit to being affiliated with them.
The Russians love plausible deniability.
It's how Putin and the KGB, FSB, etc.
operate.
It's so stupid as we know when they do stuff, it's blatantly obvious sometimes, yet it's like a game to them.
When the Wagner group got too close the Americans opened fire with everything the base had.
They picked up radio chatter from that Wagner group to their Russian handlers (the GRU deal with Wagner).
The Wagner group where freaking out and panicking as they suddenly realised that the Russian military had left them to die.
They were totally expendable.
That's how worthless they were in the Russian eyes.
Jenkins got a sprained trigger finger after that, so it's not like the Americans were completely unscathed.
I imagine a lot of other troops were a little tired and needed extra rack time for a bit too.
A Wagner group started to get too close to an American base, so the Americans contacted their Russian counterparts and told them to call back their troops as they were encroaching on their base.
The Russians said they had no idea what the Americans were talking about, they weren't their troops and didn't have any in that area.
