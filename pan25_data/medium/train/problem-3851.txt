How about the farmers pay back the trillion$ taxpayers spent destroying the Colorado basin to irrigate their desert crop lands?
With global warming the Colorado flow is going to keep going down and there is none left for welfare ag or real estate developers fevered desert dreams.
OK, OK, they don't have to pay anything back or pay to fix the problem they profited from for decades but they don't get any more tax payer money.
Wait wait wait, wouldn't that incentivize them overusing water in the hopes that they get a payout for reducing?
Like how the hell is that actually going to achieve the result without massive amounts of fuckery?

Most water rights operate on an allocation system.
Each city or even each farmer will own a certain amount of water flow out of the river.
The problem goes back to the beginning of our development in the region.
From the very beginning, we've allocated more water rights than actually exist in the river.
If the river flows X million gallons per year, then we've allocated X and a half in total rights.
That's kinda alright if some people don't use up their full allocation.
But we're definitely seeing the problems now when people \do\ use up their full allocation.
It seems what they're proposing is paying some farmers to not use their full allocation so that their water can stay in the river instead.
That's pretty reasonable in the short term.
