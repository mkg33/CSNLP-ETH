We are now in a world where Latin American nations have a better equipped military and navy with more innovative designs than Russia does.
Latin America refuses to buy anything that can only be used on offense and their discount cold war NATO equipment is still way better than what Russia has.
Modern Chinese artillery primarily use 155mm, but China has vast stocks of 152mm, soviet/russia standard, artillery and ammunition that it is now retiring, most of these are straight, or almost straight, copies of equipment Russia is already fielding.
There is basically nothing we could learn from it, and Russia could use it almost seamlessly.
Think of what Poland and other eastern NATO states have done for Ukraine, China can do that for Russia but at a much, much larger scale.
That sounds like a terrible idea for China.
The Russians are going to treat your equipment like trash, lose it to Ukraine and then we're going to take it apart and learn everything it does.
You don't want to be part of Russia's humiliation.
