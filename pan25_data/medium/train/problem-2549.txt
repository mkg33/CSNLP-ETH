>Vietnam has no paramount ruler and is officially led by four "pillars": the powerful party's secretary, the president, the prime minister and the chair of the parliament.
Yeah it’s a ceremonial role, but it’s not like they have no influence on party decision whatsoever.
You still need a considerable amount of political clout to even be considered for presidency.
Because if you are the US you have to undercut ever other countries political changes as both a powerful dictatorship with no freedom and only a pretense of government and also a travesty of democracy signaling it's intent to become the former.
That way if Phuc comes under CIA influence they can spin it either way if attempts to use him to hurt Vietnam and advance imperial interests.
Because that last line is largely bullshit that they want you to believe.
The current party’s secretary is the de facto “paramount ruler”.
At one point, he was both the party leader and the President, he’s the single most powerful man in Vietnam right now.
