Because of his organisational skills, studious attention to detail, subtle diplomatic nuances, commitment to multi-national alliances, deep military background and experience, uncorruptible track record of refusing Russian finance, and his discipline in handling sensitive documentation that he doesn't leave lying around on the sofa of the Downing Street flat.
Hes a pompous prat but he's steadfast defence of Ukraine when everyone else was still reluctant is respectable.
You can both dislike a man on his bad decisions and respect the good ones he makes.
Despite the fact he decimated the UKs armed forces, cut tank order and jet orders meaning we don't have any equipment to send to Ukraine.
The guy is a self serving charlatan that has tied himself to this conflict only for the betterment of himself.
He blamed the initial invasion of Crimea in 2014 on the European Union, not Russia.
It suited him to blame the EU then so he did.
He is also circling the leadership in his party in case he fancies another go.
If he pressures the PM to do something stupid and it blows up in his face, that is his ideal situation.
