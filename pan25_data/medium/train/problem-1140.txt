So it’s perfectly reasonable for a trans person to be mis-identified and be upset by it.
I highly doubt it’s because they’re not “fond” of one another.
A trans person doesn’t hate gay people because they don’t want to be misunderstood as gay.
They hate the mis-characterization and probably value proper identification more so than the regular person.
They don’t hate gay people.
They aren’t hostile to each others place in a collective movement.
They want to be called trans because they are trans.
Calling them gay quite literally hurts every party involved.
You’re on the right track, but you misunderstand why it’s important.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
