So you're telling to make a two PAC called ‚ÄúCitizens for Regular Idaho‚Äù and ‚ÄúKeep Oregon‚Äôs Border‚Äù just to grift.
Better yet I have never been to either state.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Greater Idaho is a grift, they will never stop because money can be made.
"Citizens for Greater Idaho" is a PAC formed by "Move Oregon's Border" which is another PAC.
Both are run by Michael McCarter.
It doesn't matter because it can't happen.
There are too many laws, resources and branches of government involved.
But that's not the real reason.
It's a scam, a grift.
There is only money to be made from fools and bigots.
The organization (if you want to call it that) is one guy with a couple of PAC's.
He solicits donations for both.
One pays the other for "services" and "administration fees" but both are him so he keeps the money.
It's make believe just like the "we build the wall" people.
You might as well debate about Santa moving to Greenland from the North Pole.
Economic impact of all of those unemployed elves at the North Pole and the inflationary impact of the operation moving to Greenland.
Greenland has immigration laws and building codes that have to be considered.
But none of that matters because Santa isn't real.
The funniest part is that these people imagined that all this land would be free.
When they got estimates for the California portion of land, they dropped that entire portion from their vision.
