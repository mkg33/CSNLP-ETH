Real financial conservatism is about cutting out bullshit spending, not dismantling well established programs to make it look like you did something while in office.
Companies do it all the time by saying "no we don't need a Keurig.
The coffee pot with filters will be fine, because it is cost effective.

In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
