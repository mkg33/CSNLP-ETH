The 118th United States Congress is poised to elect a new Speaker of the House when it convenes for its first session today.
To be elected, a candidate must receive an absolute majority of the votes cast.
The candidates put forward by each party are Kevin McCarthy (R) & Hakeem Jeffries (D.).
Until the vote for Speaker has concluded, the House cannot conduct any other business.
Based on current reporting, neither candidate has reached majority support due to multiple members of the Republican majority .
Republicans are unironically responsible for so many democrats being educated about how government works the last 6 years, it takes a lot of research and paying attention to understand just how bad they keep fucking the country and themselves.
He's going to be a laughing stock because the promises he has to make to get the votes are fucking insane.
There is a group of "Never-McCarthy" and a group of "Only-McCarthy" ...
They absolutely will block eachother with this minimal republican advantage in the house.
Herding this house of crazies is going to be nearly impossible.
There is no way he becomes some stalwart of opposition against Dems in the Senate and White House.
