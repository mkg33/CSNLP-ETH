First off there are no nukes in Ukraine, there are no plans to put nukes in Ukraine, and before Russia attacked it was unlikely that Ukraine would ever be allowed into NATO.
If nothing else the threat from Russia was already effective in stopping that without an invasion.
Secondly the analogy also fails because while NATO has expanded because the Baltic states are rightfully concerned that their Russian neighbors are expansionist autocracy bent on reuniting the former Soviet Union, the nuclear forces in Europe has pretty much remained static and amount to a fleet of nuclear bomber in a few NATO bases (mostly Germany and France but not on bordering countries) which if Russia had any issue with he could discuss it instead of invading an unrelated country (as they are scheduled to do with the US pretty soon).
If hypothetically China did point nuclear missiles at the US from the three countries you mentioned, it wouldn't make sense to attack Brazil now would it?
I was about to say itâ€™s probably more like ammo than any particular weapons systems.
Or possibly refurbishing damaged Russian weapons collected in the field.
