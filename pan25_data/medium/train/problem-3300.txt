Their WA polls are actually really slick.
They match the PVI perfectly, but undercount the youth demographic and assign 80% of independents to Smiley.
Which isn't what is happening.
Smiley is super toxic in King County, and the GOP needs to take 30%-40% in King County to be viable (which they've done in the past).
But as I said, Smiley is very galvanizing between her super pro-life stance (WA independents have a libertarian streak) and her lying about her record.
Meanwhile Patty is as popular as ever.
Cantwell is the less popular Senator (on the margins).
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
