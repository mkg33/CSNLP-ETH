Issues with internal navigation (and those that use IMUs) is sensor drift.
TLDR the math to rebuild position gets erroneous along the way because it’s like trying to guess where something is based off how fast it’s fastly moving.
That’s just tricky.
If you had a calculus class or two you get what I mean.
We use filters and GPS to back up this errornous math.
Removing GPS (even though it’s plagued with its own problems of requiring a minimum set amount of satellites to even get a position) just crippled one fixes.
So, Russia is rapidly ramping up jamming of GPS signals in case of attack in a war that doesn't exist?
He sends his nazies and prisoners to Ukraine like he sends trash from Moscow to other Russian regions.
Different kinds of trash, but strategy is same.
Shhhh don't tell the Russians that some American missiles can probably fall back on GLONASS guidance (the Russian version of gps).
A "special military operation" that is "going according to plan" would hardly justify such defensive operations.
