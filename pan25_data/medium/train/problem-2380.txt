That causes friction with cardinals and officials in the Vatican and abroad because the Francis has the power to appoint his allies to key positions.
Well seeing as popes die in service and it is extremely rare that they leave service then die, yeah its an odd circumstance.
But they definitely do have protocols for when the active pope dies.
It was in the same article that mentioned the Rabbis giving the baby boys Genital Herpies and the like.
Basically they ask people to, pretty please, consider not doing it, but they won't actually stop it.
They also encourage people to use safer methods of circumcision instead of, you know, not cutting a baby.
The church is like any other political organization.
It has orders and factions that you kind of know already.
For example Jesuits.
Jesuits are fast growing in number and influence in the church now.
At the end of the day they do vote who leads them.
So friends matter.
So if Francis isnâ€™t kept in check they end up with more jesuits in the Vatican taking power from the others.
