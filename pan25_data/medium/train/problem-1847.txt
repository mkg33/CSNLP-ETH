The difference in flight hour cost is largely due to purchasing power differences between countries that tend to operate the F-16 and countries that operate the Mig-29.
But it is not a huge paradigm shift for a maintenance crew that works on Mig-29 turbofans to start working on F-16 turbofans.
Mechanically not any more difficult than the Mig-29 or Su-27 that the Ukrainian Air Force already operates.
I don't know why people act like the UAF is flying biplanes around.
They operate a fleet of modern jets.
They have a few squads.
1 us nuke carrier has more combat ready jets than Ukraine.
Ukraine is pretty far down the totem pole in regards to having a modern military.
The American jets are very different.
When they earmarked funds to train pilots they also included training for flight crew and support.
The components may be roughly similar with each having Wings, wheels, flaps, hardpoints, hud, etc.
American jets take substantially more hours and $ to maintain compared to soviet jets per flight hours.
They are more complex and difficult to maintain.
They could easily turn into a white elephant.
>Next cheapest was the F-16 at $7000 per flight hour.
Other European designs and the F/A-18 go over $10,000 per flight hour.
Given that the MiG-29 has flight hour cost of around $4500.
