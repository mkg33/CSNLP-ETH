There also was extensive dialogue and negotiations before February 24 2022.
Zelensky was constantly trying to talk to Russia to prevent the war and top officials from NATO countries made similar outreach attempts.
Every single agreement that Russia has made they have violated and it’s not just the agreements either.
When the war started Putin declared that Ukraine wasn’t a real country and that it had no functional state and no national identity.
We’ve also seen Russia volatile every war crime in the book as well as massacre Ukrainian civilians.
It's very important to remember when judging whether Zelensky is acting in good faith here, that during his election campaign and his pre-war presidency, he was clearly seeking a degree of dialogue and reconciliation with Russia.
I absolutely do believe him when he says this is about broken trust.
Until Russia show clearly they are backing down, ie by leaving Ukraine, there is basically no reason for him or his government to believe any past good will is restored.
