I mean, I don't see the Palestinians protesting against their government like the Iranians.
In fact, they'd rather blow up Jewish children instead.
They're such nice people!
/s.
Where there's a will, there's a way.
I'm sure China and Russia have their whole state censorship mastered and yet we hear about their protests all the time.
I know I’m not properly represented by my government, I can’t imagine why it wouldn’t be also true for many Palestinians.
Also, protesting a dictatorship is not that easy.
The ones who would protest in a democracy might chose to stay home and not die today.
Also, their government might be controlling which information gets out, so there could be protestation we don’t hear about.
If your government start locking up jews, stoning lgbtq, and oppressing women then I'm sure people would start protesting.
It's funny how most Palestinians don't seem to care that and only believe jew=bad...
Actually, it's Fatah blocking the elections, since they have very good indications that Hamas would win in the West Bank as well as Gaza, and Fatah would have to step down.
Edit: People are explaining west palestine refers to gaza which makes sense.
Thanks everyone.
Though I'd clarify hamas was elected over both gaza and the west bank.
Then Bush and Condoleezza Rice, in their infinite wisdom, encouraged fatah to refuse to transition power and the 2 sides fought a civil war.
Hamas won in gaza but fatah retained power in the west Bank.
