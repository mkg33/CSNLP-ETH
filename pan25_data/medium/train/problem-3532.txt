Yeah my issue is using metadata for individuals.
It is proved it causes cancer.
Sure.
But even the worst aggregate data is 1.4 even in the heavy drinker category.
Most of them are around 1.1 for heavy drinkers.
As in you have a 10% higher chance of getting a relatively rare form of cancer by the time you die from any cause if you are a heavy drinker.
When they do these studies it’s like an extra person with cancer in 10,000 or 100,000 people.
It’s matters to societies, not individuals (unless you get cancer, of course).
Telling people “don’t enjoy having a beer for your entire life to save yourself from having a slightly increased chance of this disease killing you when you’re 80.” Well, frankly that’s not a trade off I’m willing to make.
I make my own beer.
I enjoy doing so as a hobby.
Our internal combustion engines are worse.
Processed food is worse.
Now,of course I’m talking about responsible drinking (even if too much on a Friday but you plan your ride home).
Fighting, killing people in your car….
Yeah not so much.
I remember going to the doc in my 20s and him asking how much I drank.
I knew I was drinking a bit much so I'm like I'll cut it in half or even 2/3rds.
