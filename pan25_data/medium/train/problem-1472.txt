I have observed Republicans elect all manner of incompetant people over the years, remember Strom Thurman, the senator who raped and impregnated a young black woman and then for over 50 years denied the child was his, he voted against equal rights for people consistently.
Republicans voted for this pos for decades!

I don't know either way but it's so weird that I've heard about that tape forever with 0 evidence, only speculation.
It's getting weird.
I believe Putin has some kind of "kompromat" on Trump, but it's not the piss tape.
Or at least, not only the piss tape.
The piss tape would be embarrassing, but it wouldn't destroy Trump.
Frankly, nobody would be that surprised by it.
I think Putin has something that's bad enough to put Trump in prison and/or destroy his business interests.
Something like evidence of money laundering for Russian oligarchs.
A 2023 Trump piss tape reference is so tired.
It was likely never real and was propaganda smear, let's be honest.
No way they kept that under wraps this long if it existed.
It would be worth an absurd amount of money.
I could go on and on.
When will people wake up and vote in representatives who respect everyone and want all Americans to have a better country.
