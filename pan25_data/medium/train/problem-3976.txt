I live in the US, and in a place where there’s an average household income of about $28k a year.
I definitely get it, most houses around here were built in the late 1800’s to early 1900’s, and they’re large.
The size is an issue, lots of landlords buying these houses and turning them into multi-bedroom apartments and not keeping up with them, or they languish in the care of their ancient caretakers.
They’re just expensive, all of these houses need thousands of dollars to retrofit them with newer and more efficient insulation and a litany of other things.
There’s just no money to do it.
I’m relatively fortunate in that I got my house at a pittance and have been doing the renovation myself, with my family.
It’s untenable to think that it’s the course of action that everyone could or should take, but it is something to consider if you have the tools and knowledge.
The time constraints are the biggest thing, it took about a year for most of my first floor and a small section of my second floor.
