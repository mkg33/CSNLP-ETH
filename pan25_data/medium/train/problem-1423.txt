Yup.
Saw that a couple of hours ago on TIL.
Think it’s called their Disaster Diplomacy.
Both agreeing to set aside any dispute to render aide if either country suffers a quake.
IIRC there was an episode of MASH where they had Greek and Turkish soldiers in the camp at the same time.
At first they were practically at each other's throats, but when more wounded arrived it became a contest of who could donate the most blood.
As a Greek Australian I was not only surprised to find out that my country had sent a fairly sizable contingent to Korea, but that they also gained a bit of a reputation over there.
As far as I can tell, it was a good reputation.
I heard one story that you could always tell which section of the line Greeks were stationed at because there would be singing heard from it day and night.
My friends and I do this thing on Modern Warfare where we'll be aggressively nice when people act toxic or get upset over the mic.
"Yo man your mama seems like she raised a good guy.
You should take her out to a nice dinner instead of being mad at me.
".
What are you gonna do with that?
"Fuck you, now I'm gonna go take my mom out to dinner?"
Oooh got me!
Mom still wins.
In some ways I'm biased towards Turkish stuff anyway.
Here in Sydney when there is a Kebab place, it's either Turkish or Lebanese/Arabic run.
Don't tell my Lebanese friends but the Turks always make better Kebabs.
In that good humorous way I hope it’s a bunch of Greek papas who are like “Did you know the Greeks gave us the word ‘humanity’?
Here take what ever you need!”.
