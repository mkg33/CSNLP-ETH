Why does Russia not invading the baltics, Finland, taking land from Romania, and invading the country fighting Germany at the start of the war lead to the fall of Moscow and London?
If the Russians crossed over and helped Poland and the west got their crap together and invaded Germany from the west it would have been a way shorter war with 4 countries hanging up on Germany.
The polish were fighting well even tho they were losing ground, especially the polish Air Force.
It was the Soviets that caused em to capitulate so fast.
Without the Russian bear in the East coming down on Hitler, he could prepare the blitzkrieg into France.
He couldn’t spend as much time getting ready for that while at war with Russia.
Italy wouldn’t join the war either.
Also I don’t understand how Germany would take over london, Germany couldn’t beat the RAF on its own, they wouldn’t even dream of it while dealing with the Russian Air Force.
A refugee from russia I hosted told me that Poland had plans on Ukraine.
So even some Russians that ran away from mobilization believe some of this propaganda.
