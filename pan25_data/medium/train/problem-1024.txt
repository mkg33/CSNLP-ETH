You can't maintain effective control of any situation where you're outnumbered 30-1, and as a result of those numbers being so badly skewed at every level (in the classroom, in the hallways, etc), violent behavior is allowed to fester.
On top of that, you have to do so much goddamn paperwork to discipline any student at all due to how litigious our society is, so at a very pragmatic level taking any kind of action can be a massive drain on an already strapped resource (the teacher's time/energy).
The solution that no one wants to hear is a massive increase in the number of teachers and admins working at each school, as well as a large increase in the number of schools themselves, all of which will cost an enormous amount of money that taxpayers will need to foot the bill for.
Cramming more workers into a situation isn't a guaranteed fix, but at a really basic level, you can't solve a 50-person problem with 5 people.
