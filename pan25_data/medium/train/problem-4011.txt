Russian Nobel Peace Prize laureate Yan Rachinsky blasted President Vladimir Putin’s “insane and criminal” war on Ukraine in his acceptance speech in the Norwegian capital Oslo on Saturday.
Rachinsky, from Russia’s human rights organization Memorial, claimed resistance to Russia is known as “fascism” under Putin, adding this has become “the ideological justification for the insane and criminal war of aggression against Ukraine.
Memorial, one of Russia’s most well-known and respected human rights groups, worked to expose the abuses and atrocities of the Stalinist era for more than three decades before it was ordered to close by the country’s Supreme Court late last year.

Why is it in every news articles in the last month - it's like they learn a new word and start overusing it - now everyone is slamming people, some times ago it was the word "spiel", wtf.
I feel like it’s a reading comprehension thing.
“Denounces” or “admonishes” are above a 6th grade reading level, and the US has a lot of uneducated people.
Whenever I see these headlines I'm like - "did they never learn from previous million headlines, how cringey "Slams" and "blasts" sounds?!
".
