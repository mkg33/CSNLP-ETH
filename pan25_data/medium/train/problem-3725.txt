People need to realize giving/allowing nuclear arms to Taiwan is tantamount to the US doing a reverse Cuban missile crisis (which itself was a response to US stationing nuclear missiles in Turkey).
I’m sure after the bay of pigs the communist Cubans would have viewed having Soviet nukes as a deterrent to another invasion as well.
History showed how well that sat with the Americans, regardless of real/perceived intentions of either side.
Likewise, it did not matter if it’s “for defensive purposes”, only how it were perceived by the Russian regarding the “defensive” nukes placed in Turkey that served as a precursor to Kruschev playing lose with his own nukes.
If placing third party nukes will become the norm (again?)
In obtaining leverage between major countries then you’ll quickly find such weapons being proliferated everywhere, on every continent.
No one wins here.
Edit: this guy likes to change what he wrote in entirety instead of holding an honest debate lol.
….except neither party this time is governed by doves.
I.e.
things would have ended much more violently had either Nixon or Brezhnev been in power instead of Kennedy and Kruschev…plus you’re basically handing the CCP an actual legitimate casus belli if there ever was one.
I deeply dislike authoritarianism as much as the next internet rando but not at the cost of actually instigating WW3.
I mean, I hope not, but if it keeps escalating and Taiwan is invaded, I don't see it not going that way.
Crazy thing is it would be basically the world against China and Russia at that point.
History has shown us otherwise.
After all, nukes were placed in countries like Taiwan or South Korea, and we did not see them proliferated everywhere on every continent.
