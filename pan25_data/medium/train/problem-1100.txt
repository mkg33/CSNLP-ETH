Correct me if I'm wrong, but the Montreux Convention prevents warships of the countries at war from crossing the Bosphorus and Dardanelles Straits.
Under peacetime conditions, warships are allowed to cross under certain conditions and provided it's approved by Turkey.
So couldn't the US argue that since it's not at war with either Ukraine or Russia and be allowed to cross?
Theres no need for that because if the us presses the issue they can have their warships pass through, which already happened in the past during cold war.
Currently everyone is focused on keeping the russian ships out of the black sea.
Several russian ships from pacific fleet were denied entry and knowing this prevents russia from sending everything they have to ukrainian shores.
Since the us has nothing to do other than show of force in the black sea, pushing the issue and sending their ships through the bosphorus would gain them nothing positive.
However it would give russia the excuse they need and make it difficult if not impossible to justify sending russian warships away.
So it's better if the us warships visit the bosphorus without crossing.
They can, if they want to, but they really shouldn't.
Ah, soft power in action.
It's not loud and doesn't make idiots feel strong at home, but so much of the US's naval policy is to be without doing.
It's not that the US is there, but that it can be there.
Such a public presence let's Russia know that the United States sits on Russia's border of naval influence and reminds Russia that the US can penetrate in with relative impunity.
