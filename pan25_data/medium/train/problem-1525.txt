Thanks, but the guy who rocks is the pilot of the plane flying a "Vote Raphael Warnock" banner over all of the lines in the Atlanta area.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Currently waiting in line to vote early in Atlanta... Been here for 90 minutes so far, have another 60 in front of me.
Edit: took about 150 minutes total to get through the line and vote for a single runoff race.
Because there were only three voting machines in my precinct which is one of the most populous in the state.
Fucking ridiculous.
