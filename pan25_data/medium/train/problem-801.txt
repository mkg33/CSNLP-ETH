And for good reason.
It was only earlier this year another country (I forget which entirely or I'd say) kidnapped someone in a foreign country, drove them to the kidnapping countries embassy where they couldn't be followed, sedate and tie up the person in a crate, and ship them out of the country as freight with embassy paperwork on it forbidding search or seizure that the government has to follow.
Back when that happened it was noted that it wasn't an isolated case and that other countries do it too.
If i could offer my 2 cents, learn to respect your right to say no to some kind or evil offers if you absolutely cant agree to it.
Learn to turn away an offer and, in some cases, turn away from the party or person when you cant come to some kind of agreement that you know you want or donâ€™t want.
Only identify what saying no means from the start and what, if anything, you might say yes or no to because it will help you to identify other possible paths to an agreement and can ultimately help you determine when to actually say no.
And it will help you .
In negotiations this is called a BATNA or a best alternative to a negotiated agreement.
The best case in this example is to tell China to politely and diplomatically fuck right off and shut them down.
