She posted that before he said anything antisemitic though.
So why would she need to delete that?
Defending someone for something they said in the past doesn't mean you're defending them for everything they say going forward.
Expecting someone to go back and delete Tweets is pretty ridiculous.
Saying they're antisemitic because a person they previously defended said something antisemitic is even more ridiculous.
