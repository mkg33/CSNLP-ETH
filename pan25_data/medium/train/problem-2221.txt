Maybe this would be an option for Trump if there were any way to ensure DeSantis actually follows through with a pardon, but there isn't.
Hard to imagine Trump plays along if all he has to go on is DeSantis' word.
Yep, I never blamed people for initially wanting Trump.

The political establishment sucks, so saying yeah let's have someone blow it all up was an understandable position.
I even remember thinking wouldn't it be nuts if he actually fixed something.
Then he moved the embassy to Israel and I thought "holy crap they've been promising that for years, wow."
But to still believe he's doing anything other than blindly stabbing and barely getting one or two things right at this point (more like 5 years ago) is pretty sad.
He's proved he's not working for anyone other than himself a hundred times a week since 2016.
