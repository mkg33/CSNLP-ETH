I taught nurses in hospitals.
Conflict of interest rules forbade me buying them coffee and doughnuts to have during the lecture, which was usually the only “break” they were going to get for at least half of their shift.
I couldn’t give them a pen to take notes with, if it had the company name/logo on it—because the hospitals didn’t want the APPEARANCE of a COI.
And absolutely none of it would have possibly mattered when it was time to decide which device was right for a given patient.
Coffee, doughnuts, and pens are transient commodities, forgotten after they’re used up or mislaid.
They have no value, and we still had very specific rules to govern them.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
