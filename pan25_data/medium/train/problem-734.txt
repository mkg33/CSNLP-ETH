Ukraine is beating Russia soundly, and they don't have 200 F-16s at their disposal and a 110 mile strait of ocean at the Ukraine/Russia border the way Taiwan does.
Ukraine has defended itself well with the support of Western munitions.
It's most definitely not beating Russia soundly.
There's a strong possibility that Russia will keep the Donbas oblast occupied in which they resolutely have far superior artillery to Ukraine.
Negotiations will come at some point, so this could be the compromise made.
I don't think Taiwan is as clear cut as we think.
USA et al are concerned about the processor manufacturing technology in Taiwan, with only one company in the world in the Netherlands producing the lithography technology used.
The next 3nm process has already been moved to mainland USA.
So it seems reasonable to assume Taiwan would be given up to China once the technology infrastructure is completely moved to the USA.
Then those factories will be destroyed when China start the invasion.
There's zero suggestions Russia could stop a full scale invasion of Ukraine without nukes being used.
Ukraine has rolled back every one of Russias advances and they're getting more money, training, and experience while Russia is losing all of its actual trained army.
And suggesting the US would "give up" Taiwan because of one chip factory is absurd.
The blow the US authority in the world is worth not doing it.
I gave you evidence that 3nm process has been moved to USA.
The real defense of Taiwan is dependent on how strategically useful it is to keep it in Taiwanese hands.
There's no current evidence it would be easy for China to occupy.
Long grinding war still to go.
Which is why negotiations will likely happen because despite what Zelensky says the West will realise taking Donbas will involve vast resources and support.
