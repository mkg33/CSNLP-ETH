Anyone with a clue knew russia was going to do this after they made those empty accusations that Ukraine is planning to do it.
And in continuing in the Russian spirit, sets up very clear falseflag operation of blowing up a dam just to hurt civilians, then fails to blow up dam.
Truly grateful for the sheer incompetence right now tho, I hope it holds and can be secured in time.
If only to mitigate the humanitarian catastrophe there would be if it broke..
The one good thing about fascism in all forms is that it gets rid of anyone who isn’t in the in circle so you’re left with a bunch of dumbass yes men.
If they were a little more accommodating to the smart people we would be screwed.
Blowing stuff up properly is more than just slapping a brick of c4 on it.
Finding a structural engineer for a dam and an explosive engineer is a little difficult i would assume since they failed.
I think you’re right, only experience I had with dams is from the one near me that developed cracks.
That dam has a different design than this, but it needed to be completely drained and repairs took several years.
I kind of assume even hairline fractures can become an issue rather quickly considering what a mind boggling amount of water it’s holding in.
