When migration authorities started to restrict their access, "lots of lawyers petitioned habeas corpus in their name".
In our implementation of habeas corpus, it can be used 24/7, and within 24 hours the judge meets with both parts (the restricted person and the authority that restricted them), with the judge ruling immediately after the meeting ends.
IANAL, but I guess they use it because otherwise they would have been forced to take a flight back.
This is remarked by the Migrations Directior in the quouted interview, because "at the exact moment we restrict their entrance, lots of lawyers would petition habeas corpus, clearly this is some kind of organized scheme, if I were refused entrance to a country I would spend a lot of time finding a lawyer, in a country I don't know, I don't speak the language".
Habeas corpus was widely used during our last dictatorship because of the disappearances.
Immigration authorities in Argentina are cracking down on Russian women who have started travelling to Buenos Aires to give birth in order to gain Argentinian citizenship for their children since the invasion of Ukraine.
