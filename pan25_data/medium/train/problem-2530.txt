‘Tim Downs, president of the Indiana State Fraternal Order of Police, says the law might give people the impression that they can shoot police with impunity.
“It’s just a recipe for disaster,”.’.
Mr. Downs, everyday I feel like law enforcement officer have the impression that they can shoot me with impunity.
So now we are equal footing.
I feel like they could have chosen the safer path by making sure all the officers have their body cams on.
But I suppose that would only lead to early retirement or slap on the wrist.
