The thing is, they've all been real.
This is how real science actually works: incremental progress, one step at a time, and it almost seems like nothing is changing until you look back on the last 20 years.
What you're really asking though, I assume, is: is this ready to start developing for market?
The answer is unfortunately no, not yet, but we're much closer.
Think of it like "we're not there yet, but we can see the finish line clearly now."
No fusion tomorrow, but also no more "fusion is always 20 years away.
".
So.
Can Tom Hanks play the scientist who made the breakthrough discovery randomly while washing dishes and then he did some scribbles on the foggy window in front of him and figured it all out?
He wasn't paying attention to his family much, and now that he hands off his knowledge to the world he can focus on what's really important.
The simple things, and watching his kids grow.
Good point.
Hanks also lost his kid in a drowning accident and never really got over it.
Just kept his nose to the grindstone and kept on working.
It was Jennifer Lawrence who finally cracked the code while washing dishes.
Her stay at home dad husband was getting ready to leave her too.
Thankfully not only did she save the world, she also saved her family.
This is actually a pretty significant step for them.
NIF was never designed to be a power plant prototype but rather a lab to better understand fusion reactions.
Along the way, they have been able to finesse further efficiency and optimizations.
They have had three major milestones: actual fusion reaction initiated, fusion reaction that nets positive from the target’s perspective (which I find slightly arbitrary), and fusion reaction that nets positive from the laser’s perspective (a very reasonable standard, and a seriously commendable achievement).
