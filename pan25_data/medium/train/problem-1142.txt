I was talking about this idea yesterday.
People who are consuming this news topic all day long will absolutely think it's a bigger deal than people who aren't.
In my conversation yesterday it was about the stock market and my friend was saying "How come nobody cares about this This is the biggest thing in financial history" Because many people aren't looking at it... And the people who are consuming the topic non-stop look crazy to the people who aren't because their level of involvement and information is much different.
It's the idea that perception is reality.
In general, be courteous to others.

Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
