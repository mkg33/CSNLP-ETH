It's not an issue the politicians actually care about, but it is one they think they can use to rally voters to support something they don't realize they are supporting.
In that case, voters think they are saving babies for Jesus or whatever when really, they are voting to challenge the 14th Amendment and roll back Civil Rights.
In this case, voters think they are saving the Levant for Jesus or whatever when really, they are voting to line the pockets of cronies in the military-industrial complex and the oil industry.
In both cases, politicians tried a couple different angles before finding something that stuck.
EDIT: annexation of the West Bank would be catastrophic for both Israelis and Palestinians and should never happen.
annexation makes at least some sense, they share water sources, the grid management is fairly centralized, tax collection is already done by Israel.
Israel would have to make the Apartheid official, ofc, if they wanna prevent Palestinian-area people from having political representation in what is de facto an ethnic focused government.
