The officials are trying to impress FIFA, so the next logical step would be to clear the streets of poor people.
Those poor people are probably less trusting than these dogs and would be hard to stab with a poison dart, but if they're hungry enough they might not be cautious enough to avoid free food.

We had to amputate his leg.

It’s devastating.”.
