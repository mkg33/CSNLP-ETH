It’s not so much the Ru equipment.
It’s more their maintenance is ramshackle along with atrocious command and control and the cherry on top is a military filled with a few well trained but a lot of poorly trained troops.
Still, anyone thinking of buying Ru fighter jets and armour will want a much bigger kickback then before.
I wouldn't want to be the salesman for the Russian equipment.
Can you imagine trying to sell the stuff.
"We can fill your order but there maybe a bit of a delay... long delay".
Does it come with ammunition supply " oh sorry you will need to speak to our Iranian store about ammunition".
Do you take VISA - "um, no but do you have cash, we can throw in some defiant conscripts for target practice".
Do you have spare parts and maintenance support - " um can you repeat that, not sure what you said, maintenance?
I'm not sure what that means, is it Vietnamese for something... can we have an interpreter over here".
I wonder what the sales pitch from Russian dealers is.
With how their army is performing must be some deep discounts plus lies about delivery schedules.
Unless they are selling designs for local production might be a tough sale.
