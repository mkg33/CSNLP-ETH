I think it's the entitlement of people nowadays.
At least for me that is what it is.
The entitlement of thinking you can break the rules and solve it with money is an annoying mentality.I live in a very rich tourist area of Florida and it happens all the time.
Not condoning the violence but I get why people get pissed at this type of shit.
I'm glad it's discouraged now.
I think maintaining a respectful, almost reverential atmosphere is important, just as one would expect from visitors to a cathedral.
Especially in a country whose citizens probably feel looked-down upon by tourists.
Especially since this pyramid was open to be climbed by the public until 2006.
They only closed it because there were a ton of injuries from people falling and a woman died in 2006 from a fall.
I have climbed it too and remember spending far too long trying to decide if descending it would be a good decision.
I also liked I could see the Holiday Inn next to the site while at the top.
And roads were made to be driven on, doesn't mean we get to drive on the wrong side of the road.
That's a child's argument.
Guns were made to shoot people, doesn't mean we should shoot people.
Things have rules and regulations, despite what was allowed centuries ago.
