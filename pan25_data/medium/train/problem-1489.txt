My resting heart rates been very high since I had covid 6 months ago.
Around 115bpm while sitting and 120s while standing.
It can jump into 150s with minor exercise or stress.
I was just diagnosed with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and told I have air trapped in my lungs.
Until 2 months ago I had a really tough time breathing most days.
It’s very stressful feeling my heart pounding for no real reason.
Im 33, I really hope it can be resolved but cardiologists tell me there’s no course of treatment.
They don’t want to give me beta blockers which I thought might help.
I had to cut out caffeine too which obviously sucks.
Covid was a mild cold for me but my sense of taste and smell is still super messed up over a year later.
Most things taste sour to me.
I like bland foods a lot now because at least they don’t taste bad.
I feel your pain...
Same boat for me, I keep trying to go back to foods I used to love and it's not the same, feel like I'm chasing the white rabbit of flavor nostalgia and can never get it...
Oh and I can't smell cat pee... Like at all.
Which is cool I guess until you realize that this means.
