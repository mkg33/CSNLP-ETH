And for Russia, formally annexing the two Separatist bits of Georgia, with a huge hint that if they resist in any way, they'll be next.
Allowing Putin to take over Ukraine (as the four Oblasts he's already laid claim to would be purely a stepping stone to either officially annexing the rest of Ukraine or turning it into Belarus Mk.
II - notionally independent but dances solely to Moscow's tune) would effectively send a message to all former SSRs not already in NATO that they'd better not do anything to annoy Mother Russia "or else."
Heck, if he could also get Sanctions lifted, he might even try a NATO Member in a decade or two after regrouping and rearing - especially if he can also persuade NATO to reduce their expenditure and all missiles and non-national troops out of East Europe, and have no training exercises in the Baltic or Black seas.
That may be talking about governments themselves, that have to make hard financial trade offs between helping Ukraine and financing things to help their own citizens.
The latter affects public perception of the government too, even if the public isnâ€™t that aware of the trade off.
