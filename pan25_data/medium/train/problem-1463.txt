If a doctor whistleblows about Medicare fraud at a hospital because she is ethically uncomfortable with the hospital’s actions, we don’t accuse that doctor of hating medicine as a whole.
If a lifelong churchgoer whistleblows about child abuse by priests, we don’t accuse that employee of hating Christianity.
Whistleblowers deserve protection, not to be tarred and feathered as liars because of the identity of the organization they’re reporting.
