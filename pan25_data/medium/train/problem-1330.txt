Using that logic, I assume you believe the United States government bares no responsibility for school shootings.
Not the governments fault they allowed the shooters to buy the bullets.
Or is this just a fun exercise on hipocracy?
Why is this an article that seems to place blame on America?
If a bullet hits a civilian that was provided by the USA, is it americas fault the bullet is there in the first place?
It's an American missile interfacing with a Mig-29 radar.
The fact they hit anything at all is fucking astonishing.
And it was in Donbass.
Probably locked a radar, and the radar moved last second (as is standard anti-air doctrine) to behind the building or something.
For the amount of ammunition, shells, weapons, Ukraine is getting and using, this shouldn’t be a story.
At least not the way they frame it in the title.
Munitions are never 100% stable.
The title specifically wants to focus on “US made”.
Editors chose titles with care.
Technically they might be correct, but they are assholes for trying to create outrage.
