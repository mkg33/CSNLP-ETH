It's crazy how much Russia relies on radioactivity for relevance and clout.
Article says they wanted to capture Ukrainian nuclear plants - to threaten Europe with accidents.
That's the only issue with nukes, once you're exposed as being all bark no bite, you're a laughingstock.
But if anyone ever bites with nuclear radiation, not only do they likely poison the very thing they want but they've just set the entire world against them and risk surprise regime change.
It fits their MO and desired image though - silent, unnoticed, deadly.
Too bad no one perceives Russia that way anymore.
Russia used to be like radiation.
Now it's more like North Korea.
I feel like we're already there.
I believe there are those in Russia that already regard the rest of the world helping Ukraine defend itself from Russian invasion as that existential threat.
However, this latest invasion would be the THIRD in Ukraine (Crimea, then Donbas) and the world let Russia do it.
Were the world to let Russia take all of Ukraine, I see no reason why Russia would stop there and the republics of Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia would be next.
I have no desire to antagonize Russia, but the only other alternative Russia is offering is to support the defense of Ukraine or simply let Russia take whatever country it want and that is simply not an option.
