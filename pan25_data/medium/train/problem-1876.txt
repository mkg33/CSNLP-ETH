My opinion is China see's just how much weaponry we've given Ukraine over the passed year, what it's doing to Russia, and the question mark of just how much the US still has.
Not to mention all of our carriers and support aircraft.
We're a nation that thrives on violence; but we're also a nation that prides itself on helping others and trying to be the good guys.
Long enough for them to secure just enough new military technology that would allow them to take Taiwan and hold it, and economic power to withstand the fallout from their action.
That's my guess.
It may or may not be achievable for China.
Who knows where they are with black projects that could let them take the island.
Idk.
I would like to think they wouldn't try.
And if they do, it will be an utter failure for them.
Hopefully, but the US has been reluctant to send certain technologies to Ukraine out of fear they could fall into Russian/Chinese hands.
In the event of conflict over Taiwan there could be some similar reluctance, especially if US decision makers think there's a high probability Taiwan would lose, as was the case early on in the Ukraine war.
