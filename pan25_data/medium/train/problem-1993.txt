You know what i mean though, the lack of other opportunities in their are which would lead to instability and eventually poverty.
Poverty is alot of things, it can be not being able to afford a medical event, having to take care of a family member economically etc.
There can be alot of issues in some areas of the States, atleast that was my perception while i was there.
Lovely people, shitty corporations, thats a topic for another say though.
Obviously most were happy to serve, not taking anything away from that at all.
We had no issue with anyone, everyone was great.
I just got the impression from alot of guys when they talked about their life, that they might have taken another road if they had the opportunity to do so.
I hope that is more clear, as it seems it was needed.
It's gonna be tough enough keeping ISIS at bay, but does anyone know how populated these areas that they are drilling on are?
I seem to remember reading somewhere about how fiercely territorial Afghans can be to incursions on their land.
