No, not until there is 1) an international effort from multiple governments to undermine the legitimacy of the IRI, 2)an organized resistance effort with a well-supported leader, and 3) lots and lots of weapons so that the citizens fighting the regime are armed.
It would help to also target military bases, prisons and government buildings.
Burning Khomeini's ancestral home was a good first step.
Now they need to go wreak havoc in every detention center/police center, set fire to every police car they see, target well-known basijis and literally just assassinate them one-by-one, and sieze government's and big basijis' assets/properties.
It's time that people start exterminating supporters of IRI cause clearly, they can't coexist with others in the modern world without posing a serious humanitarian and existential threat to them.
Just like the nazis had to go, the mullahs have got to go.
Power needs to be taken away from them, and that will never be achieved peacefully if we are being realistic.
Well all that pressure applied to control the population will by force of nature and history create equal pressure to destroy the regime just a matter of time.
I know what you're thinking, what if some of these angry women protesting are virgins and can't be executed according to the official flavor of Islam in Iran?
Just imagine how fucked that place is when their plan is to do all that and just continue to rule afterwards.
Just...
Problem solved!
Phew, that was a close one guys.
Don't worry they have a solution for that.
They just forcefully marry them to government officers, which then rape them to consume the marriage and put them in line for execution!
