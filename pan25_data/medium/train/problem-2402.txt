They're not stupid.
Without US support and protection, they're just another impoverished island nation relying on tourism to stay afloat.
Absolutely no disrespect intended, but the pragmatic truth is that their only intrinsic value is as a strategic military geographic position; they have no other real resources to trade, no mining, precious metals or logging, no serious industry.
Nope, the good people of Samoa know that right now, all things considered, they are stronger as a US territory.
No question that the US needs to treat them (and all other territories, like Puerto Rico) much better than we do.
True they don’t have natural resources to exploit but they have fostered an amount of goodwill and connection across the pacific and beyond that has helped protect the ocean and her resources when possible.
Tbh I’ll admit our main export is people and culture (samoa as a people not the two nations ma le diaspora) and the value of our guardianship of biodiversity and the ocean isn’t immediately obvious or flashy, but Its honest work haha hopefully we and other indiginous and other kaitiaki keep buying time for solutions and sustainability and chiusuuus and flag waving haha.
For us and many descendants to come.
Imagine if they did gain autonomy, what would they actually gain from an economic standpoint?
That being said I do think it’s messed up how American Samoa is the only US territory that doesn’t offer birthright citizenship to the US.
