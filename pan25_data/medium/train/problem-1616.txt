Lots of articles about how the Federal government has sued Texas for 2021's racial gerrymandering.
I couldn't find one that pointed out that it happened in a special session because the Trump 2020 census was late despite him stopping it early because of all his tricks.
The Texas constitution requires redistricting only during the first regular session after a census and if not then send to some special board.
That wouldn't do because Repubs wouldn't get exactly what they wanted so they said fuck the state constitution.
Lots was said about it at the time.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
