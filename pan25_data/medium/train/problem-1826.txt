The most terrible injuries were because of illegal fireworks.
The pollution is almost non existent because the smog clears up after a day.
The particles of the firework get washed into the soil by rain and are not that harmful.
Animals also survive Storms, Thundersturms etc.
so something small as man made (especially German cat.
II fireworks) are nothing compared to the force of nature.
It’s only 3 days a year.
Banning firework will get people to buy illegal and more dangerous fireworks from Poland etc.
Pro tip from the US: if someone is actively breaking into your house, they’ll likely be long gone before police get there, and you’ll file a report and little to nothing will happen after that.
If your car is broken into, you’ll be filing a report over the phone and will never physically see a cop and you can kiss the stolen sht goodbye.
The report may help you with your insurance to get the broken window fixed, but expect that to cost less than your deductible and to pay for that out of pocket too (ask me how I know).
