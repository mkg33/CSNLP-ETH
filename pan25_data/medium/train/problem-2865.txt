Republicans spent fifty years maneuvering extremists into our legislatures, our courts, and even the presidency.
We have to be willing to do the same and for far longer.
We have to be as relentless and single-minded as the ones who stole our rights away and, yes, I do consider abortion rights as MY rights.
Confront them with their own words, force them to talk about it, don't let them cowardly hide behind their supposed morality.
The Republican party, in its current incarnation, is a blight upon this world, an embarrassment that can't even govern itself, and a vicious monster that gleefully inflicts suffering upon people.
They aren't moral, they aren't a majority, and they sure as hell aren't silent.
We can't afford to be silent either.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
