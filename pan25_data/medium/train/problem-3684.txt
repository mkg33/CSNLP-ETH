Biggest controversy imo was her accusing KMW and Rheinmetall that their Puma IFV really sucked because they "broke down".
But slowly details emerged that the issues were extremely minor and pretty much are the fault of incompetent army soldiers.
She changed her mind to still keep the IFV orders for the future but its very obvious she has no idea whats going and that theres a severe lack of transparency.
Nobody wants another von der Leyen (remember the incredibly stupid G36 issue).
well, german defence minister is alsmost always a career killer.
the bundeswehr is full of problems (old equipment broken, planes grounded, tanks breaking down, the sailboat refit going way over budget, spent millions on new guns that don't shoot straight) and scandals (if not neo-nazis in the special forces again, then at least bizarre demeaning "rituals" or soldiers posing as refugees requesting asylum to get social benefits), and defence ministers always get to take their hat over it.
i think von der leyen was the only one in the last 30 years that had a significant post after being defence minister, because she switched to become eu comissioner in time.
