well we kinda toxified everything else in life seemingly including games with gambling reinforcement, based on the 00's and how youtube broke through the forest to show you the tree you were looking for before google even bought them, i think it may be more of a tail wagging the dog situation and a proper inoculation of media with self correcting moral dilemma thought experiments ala star trek when it was good in its prime stints should vaccinate against the negative feedback loops which nobody truly likes but utilize as an effigy of their own interpersonal dilemmas which they face relentlessly without resolution.
yeah tiktok is bad, but im saying it is a symptom to a problem which is caused by other issues and solving some of the other issues such as privacy awareness could render tiktok powerless as anything other than a time waster.
