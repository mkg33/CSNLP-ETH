Ramadan almost always bring more tension between Israeli and Palestinians.
Last year with with a Bennet-Lapid government, we saw a much quester than usual Ramadan.
We'll see what is going to happen this year, but National Security minister Itamar Ben Gvir already announced he plans on making fireworks illegal (a usual Ramadan celebration especially towards the end and Eid al Fitr) meaning that he is opening the door to tons of arrests of Arabs.
Meanwhile next week is the Jewish holiday of Purim, when Jews also often like to light off fireworks.
And I can guarantee you that no Jews will be arrested for this either.
Why would he be banning fireworks?
Any ideas?
Do the Palestinians ever use them to launch at police or civilians as part of their Ramadan celebrations?
Also, I thought Israelis light fire works on independence day, not during Purim.
Is it common to have fireworks displays for purim?
Isn't that the holiday where they eat hamentachen?
I looked up what you said about last year.
This article seems to suggest 2022 was the worst since 2015 in terms of casualties, which doesn't quite fit what you said.
Any ideas why?
Unfortunately that this psycho is back in power.
He did everything he could to end the Iran nuclear deal that has been pushing for a war for the better part of 20 years.
