This author is just participating in the great reimaging campaign the RNC is paying the media to do for MTG.
She is still racist and homophobic and believes all the shit she said she did.
They just finally got through to her about how bad it is for her image.
I do have a concern with the way the author takes her sudden change of heart at face value.
It's pretty clear to me at least that MTG was only pandering to nut jobs to get elected, and now that the wind has shifted a bit, she's changing her tune to match.
Who knows what she actually believes.
I suspect the answer is "whatever it takes".
