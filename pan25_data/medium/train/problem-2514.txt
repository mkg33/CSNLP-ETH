And I hope not a drop of this gas will be burnt.
It is time to go nuclear or renewable energy and not to make planet even hotter.
At first they will be happy because of dollars from gas and then they will cry in UN for billions of dollars help because of drought.
Egypt burns nearly 800KT of coal every year.
Even if this just replaces the coal usage, that literally cuts their coal greenhouse gas emissions in HALF.
It is impossible to just burn gas instead of coal in your powerplants without serious and very expensive rebuild - again why should they invest so much money in CO2 emiting powerplants instead of investing this money in zero emission energy?
Do you have any source about possibility and costs of transition coal powerplant to gas?
I will be very grateful because I can't find anything reliable.
Thanks a lot.
After reading this article I have changed my mind.
You convinced me that it will be good temporary solution for Egypt before they will fully transition to renewables.
"The new NGCC plants have a total generating capacity of 15.3 GW, 94% more than the 7.9 GW capacity of the coal-fired power plants they replaced.
The increase in capacity is largely a result of the advanced turbine technology installed in NGCC plants.
".
Glad to help, sorry if I came off dickish.
One of the main reasons a lot of nations are able to meet their carbon goals is solely due to switching to NG from oil/coal.
They're easily done, and make the coal plant produce nearly twice the energy at far less carbon emissions.
