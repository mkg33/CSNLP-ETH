I mean, technically the world will eventually run out of oil someday.
Or at least, feasibly extractable oil.
When I was a kid, I was always worried and wondering about what would happen if/when the world ran out of oil (I was also worried about the world running out of iron to make steel too- I played too much Industry Giant 1&2 as a kid).
Anyway, depleting the world’s oil reserves is a very concerning reality.
I had this Mickey Mouse/Goofy comic book from the 1970’s (my mother found it at the thrift shop) and it explained how energy/electricity worked, energy sources like coal, oil, nuclear and the energy crisis we then faced (and continue to face whether or not people want to admit it).

For what it's worth, I don't agree.
He is right, he's focusing on the absurdity of meeting in person with methods that are absolutely contributing to the very problem they are discussing, while not using nearly as effective and much less damaging means like video conferencing.
The person that replied to him claimed that he is saying they must do so without communication or coordination, but that's so far off what he was saying that it's pretty blatantly in bad faith, or so far off the mark that arguing further is pointless if they can't see the difference in what they accused and what he said.
