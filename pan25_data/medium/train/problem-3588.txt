That's my profession opinion.
Procedures establish the "laws" for performing activities and the steps to complete those actions.
Success relies on execution of procedures and policies.
You need clearly established procedures/policies.
They will not actually prevent a problem.
The article doesn't explain the changes and read more like they're gonna make changes and consensus must still be obtained.
The fact that it was technically possible for that error to occur means that procedures alone wonâ€™t prevent it from happening again.
