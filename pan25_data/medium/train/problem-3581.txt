Really important to get the ammo for the 35 mm Oerlikon cannons the Gepard is equipped with.
The Gepard proved quite valuable in blowing Russian (Iranian) drones out of the sky.
The re-export of weapons to Ukraine is no longer a taboo.
At least according to the Security Policy Commission of the National Council (CPS-N) which recommends that the plenum authorize such transfers.
With 14 votes to 11, the green light was given to a motion and a parliamentary initiative asking for the possibility of proceeding in this direction.
The first provides for the amendment of Article 18 of the Federal Law on War Material (WMA), so that the Federal Council can revoke the non-re-export declaration signed by countries that have purchased Swiss material.
This would apply in cases where the United Nations Security Council declares in a resolution a violation of the prohibition of the use of force under international law.
The declaration could also be revoked if the United Nations General Assembly finds, with a two-thirds majority, a violation of the international ban on the use of force.
The Federal Council could maintain the re-export ban if the repeal were to jeopardize an overriding Swiss foreign policy interest.
The parliamentary initiative also aims to amend article 18 and wants to void the non-re-export declaration if it is ascertained that it occurs in connection with the Russo-Ukrainian war.
The change would take effect on March 1 and run until December 31, 2025.

The only thing we can't be neutral about is money!
