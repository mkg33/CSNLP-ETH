The Finns know what's up with Russian trollery and stoogery.
They call it "hybridivaikutus" and it gets called out and ignored when it appears.
That's not to say there isn't a small segment of loonies in Finland too, with a few figurehead Putinists (Johan Bäckman is a well known one), but they get almost no traction.
Johan Bäckman is merely a puppet used to fix our attention with outrageous public statements.
Someone we can point at and say "that is propaganda".
He's not the dangerous part though.
The real propaganda is subtle and dangerous.
It's consistent, systematic and discrete.
It's as simple as the Russian news agency TASS (state controlled, of course) using words like calling Finland and Sweden "neutral".
European and American news agencies start to use the same.
None of the countries have been neutral since 1995 when they joined EU.
But the idea can be left to fester and infect the minds of people.
Yep, I suspect we have both seen the presentation about this by Martti J. Kari (retired FDF intelligence officer), he brings up these exact points w.r.t.
Bäckman.
I don’t even know how it can be done, at the individual level at this point.
The situation is incredibly toxic - it’s like sepsis.
Organizational psychology, waeponized by the Russians, has probably done more harm to the populations and democracies around the world than anything else the Russians could ever manage short of using their neuclear weapons.
Bravo to the Finns for being least susceptible to it.
And there's other versions online too.
The real number of viewers is hard to estimate, but it's much much higher than 27k.
