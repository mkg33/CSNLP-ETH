Part of that seems to be that it's a low cost regional plane operated by a lot of small regional airlines.
Perfectly good planes can become death traps when poorly maintained, and small regional airlines in far flung parts of the world can have shocking maintenance standards.
And may be flying into more difficult airstrips due to the airline size as well.
Not sure how this exact one in Nepal is, but some of them are pretty extreme.
Nepal has a few high altitude airports that can be considered dangerous because of hills surrounding.
However, this flight was from Kathmandu to Pokhara, a relatively safer route.
I've flown into this airport as a passenger.
It was absolutely amazing but nerve wracking knowing it was one of the world's most dangerous airports.
Considering that the captain(pilot) had 20+ years of experience, a recording shows what seem to be stalling and spiraling left side- this likely was equipment failure.
The runway ends with a wall so I don't think there's any go rounds if the pilot overshoots.
They have to nail the landing.
