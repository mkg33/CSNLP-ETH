India exports because they find it's to their advantage.
It's their choice and if I were the boss of India, it's probably what I would do to.
Western nations that import from India, ultimately are helping to raise the living standard in India.
Still, westerners (or anyone who is buying goods from Indians working at low/no wage) are benefiting from their suffering.
Have been for years now.
So when they are benefiting financially from the suffering of another nation, and they get called out about it - just seems that they might feel it's a bit hypocritical.
'If you benefit because of our suffering, it would be good to see more of your help addressed to us," Mr Kuleba said, responding to Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar's statement on Monday that between the months of February and November this year, the European Union (EU) has imported more fossil fuel from Russia than the next 10 countries combined.
To be fair, Indian's have been providing labour at slave wages (or as actual slaves) to provide cheap goods for the benefit of western nations.
Mr. Kubela is right, but it must smack a bit of hypocrisy to Indians.
