True,.
but the satisfaction of seeing 44 billion die, is still gonna be fun to witness, Elon Musk gets what he deserves, as his 5 year old, autistic brain, obviously can't handle people.... and he's angrily shown nothing but utter contempt for his workers.
I agree but him being a business man and thousands of accountants working for him, he will somehow write it off as loss on his other income (Tesla) to not pay taxes.
It's still a large-scale public failure and embarassment, and Musk cares a lot about his image.
It'll also likely decrease the amount of money people are willing to throw at anything with Musk's name attached.
But it is also a place where people from countries without free press can post information to outside world in real time.
This function was hugely impactful during Arab Spring and Twitter enacted various alternate ways to tweet when authorities in those countries tried to stop people from using it.
It's also probably the most immediate and direct way of communication between us so called regular folks and scientists, politicians, actors, musicians, artists etc.
