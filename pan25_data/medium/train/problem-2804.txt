He is probably referencing the fact that Japan has said they will downgrade covid-19 to flu status, which means masks aren't encouraged as much any more and businesses don't have to require them.
Also the whole "everyone wears a mask in Japan" was kind of blown out of proportion.
Before Covid some people wore masks due to flu season or allergies, but it was probably like 1% or less of the population.
I think it was more, went to Tokyo in 2019 and it was rare to jump on a subway wagon and not see at least a couple people with masks, even if it wasn’t crowded.
Though outside of Tokyo it’s probably less common.
I’ve lived in Japan almost a decade.
I’m referring to all the idiots (mostly expats) who keep dismissing the risks of covid that are still very much real.
Given foreigners make up a tiny fraction of Japan's population, that 30% is significant.
I'm in PH now and I would bet less than 25% of white people I see wear masks.
Yeah I get it.
When I was last in Japan i would say maybe 30% of the time I saw someone without a mask they were a foreigner.
The others are mostly the elderly who just don't care.
