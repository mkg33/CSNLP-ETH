Thank god it’s rare for anything to happen.
The most dangerous part isn’t the bomb squad’s job but actually finding it, because if you don’t know it’s there, you may cause vibration or movement that causes an explosion.
Usually these things are found by excavators.
Man, Bosnia still had exploding land mines at least 16 years after the war.
Rogue, callous disregard for innocents is poison.
I hope clearing goes quickly.
in 2012 we were still recovering mines left by the Russians during their '88-89 retreat from Afghanistan.
and not one or two, huge open areas packed with them.
It's a very difficult, expensive and time consuming job.
There are still richer countries in EU that are finding unexploded bombs from WW2.
You can never be 100% sure the area is clear from danger.
Many bombs are found near railways, as that was crucial war infrastructure during WW2 and therefore heavily targeted.
Last year 4 construction workers were severely injured by an American WW2 bomb in Munich.
They were excavating an area along the main railway in Munich and an excavator struck the bomb, causing it to detonate.
One guy lost his leg.
