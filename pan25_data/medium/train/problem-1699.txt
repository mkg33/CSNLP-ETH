On the second anniversary of Trump’s attempt at an insurrection we find the democrats praying on the capitol steps.
The republicans were engaging in bribery to get one of their “leaders” elected as speaker of the House, another gained election through lies and deception, some of them may have participated in the conspiracy around the insurrection, and the majority of them offered fealty to a former president who may face criminal charges for that insurrection, improper handling of classified documents, and other actions.
The difference is like night and day, guess which one craves the darkness.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
