I bought the house I bought about 6 years ago in part because the school district was rated highly--and I knew damn well that the good rating was in a big way dependent on the fact that the school must have good revenue coming in from the local tax base.
A change to how PA's public schools are funded could reasonably stand to actually hurt how the school district my kids are lined up to go to will be funded, since I doubt any new funding structure will only result in increases to funds available for each PA school.
And I still say: good.
