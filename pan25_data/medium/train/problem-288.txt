The twitter blue shit never made any sense.
Even if every single blue checkmark paid (and obviously they wouldn't) it wouldn't have made enough money to even put a dent in the costs to finance the acquisition in the first place.
The checkmark never made any sense \[1\] bit one of the other features Musk is pushing is that having blue will heavily boost your posts in the feed.
The idea being that anybody who really wants to be "seen" on twitter will need to buy in.
So he figures every Instagram "influencer", every brand, every cryptobro, every celeb, every MLMer, etc will feel the need to pay, so their message will be seen, not buried.
\[1\] Musk noticed that the checkmark was viewed as a bit of a coveted status symbol.
Which was true enough, since generally only brands or sufficently notable individuals would get awarded one.
Under the old system plenty of people would have been willing to pay to get verified, as long as it remained a somewhat exclusive club.
By making it available to literally everybody who pays it loses a lot of its value, and no longer especially interesting as a status symbol.
Much like if Rolex were to put out a line of $150-200 low end mechanical watches that at a glance appear the same as some of the normal (high-end) models.
Then being seen with a Rolex would no longer be much of a status symbol.
More like he overpaid by $30 billion or $40 billion.
Twitter has always had troubles making money.
They were always quiet about this but Elon has been very vocal about the problem.
He tried to find ways to make more money like Twitter blue but that only made things worse because some advertisers left Twitter because users were pretending to be companies/famous people.
