They failed the people of afghanistan who actually believed the US would usher in a new era that would last indefinately, but that was never possible.
The US can't even come together to agree on things within its own borders, on what planet did anyone think that they would achieve Pro West unanimity in Afghanistan...
"Number 1: Russia's, of course Number 2: Big parade, with fireworks, dancers, a huge band in The Red Square, with blackjack and hookers Number 3: Soon Like, very soon, sooner than you'd think...any day now...I swear it will come very quickly GLORY TO RUSSIA!

Nike walks in.
A wooden signpost clicks flat on the counter as her fingers tap tap tap along its surface.
She leans in and speaks with a slight grin to cover up her annoyance.
Which is quite the coup for US intelligence.
It failed in Afghanistan and arguably it failed to properly assess Russian Strenh before the War.
Turns out corruption makes intelligence gathering super difficult.
The Taliban took over because you can't stop out an organization like that especially when keeping soldiers in their borders.
And on a more technical level they never failed afghanistan in fact they actually relatively stabilized it until they decided to remove their assistance for the country.
But the overall objectives from the beginning were mostly accomplished, Osama had been taken out, the radicals had been heavily surpressed and a semi stable government had been setup.
It wasn't until the US set in stone a date to pullout of the country that those radicals came out of hiding and that setup government rolled over.
But the US achieved a successful pullout of the country.
