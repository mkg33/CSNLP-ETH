Yes, but Germany made it clear that they would not hinder Leo2 transfers to Ukraine from other countries.
Just wanted to add this and find it silly but that's how it is right now.
No they did not.
We have the Vice Chancellor saying they should allow it, which means they currently arent.
Then Scholz saying no exports without the US sending Abrams.
Poland sending tanks is re-exporting them, which is covered by Scholz's statement.
And that's before we get to Scholz's earlier statements, No tanks unless its a coalition, or no tanks till someone else sends theirs first.
Both of which have now happened, and yet he moved the goalposts to only if the US sends Abrams.
No, that is not what it means.
It means he would support approval, if a request is made.
Reportedly a request has been filed today.
Before there were no such requests.
It is on par with other tanks.
It still uses the old 120mm gun that was used in the Leopard up to the 2A5 version.
It has been replaced with a better gun with the 2A6 version which came into service in 2001.
