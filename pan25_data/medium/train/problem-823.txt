Hungary is mainly looking for a handout again and concessions with regards to the money for Hungary the EU is still sitting on due to their compliance failures.
I hope no concessions will be made and the EU finds a way to simply bypass Hungary in this as indicated in the article.
From what I've understood, Hungary sounds like a fractious middle child.
Happy to withhold something good to someone in need unless they get a handout too.
Frankly, I'm disgusted at them using leverage like this, especially if it's because they've failed to complete required steps to get what they want.
It sounds like this is a bit of a headache for the EU, but not a real roadblock.
They can bypass Hungary's veto:
> Thus, if Budapest does not give up its veto, the EU can also take a similar decision in 26 countries, RMF FM sources among diplomats in Brussels suggest.
"It is difficult for a small pro-Russian state, which has exemptions from all sanctions, to dictate the position of the entire EU," said one of them.
Because the rules were written under the, in hindsight very naive, assumption that member states would act in good faith and not be a disruptive vassal of (or 5th column for) a hostile external party.
