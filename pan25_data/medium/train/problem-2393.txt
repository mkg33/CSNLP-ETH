And one who won't say the quiet part through a bull horn, yeah we need reasonable gun regulations... but if you make it your whole campaign the gun nuts will attack, and there is enough nuances to the issue that 30 second campaign ads can not address the problem.
In part that’s because a Sanders Presidency, if by some miracle he’d won, would likely have been a lame duck presidency from the very beginning.
Democrats can’t even unite behind the relatively inoffensive and status quo supporting blandness or Joe Biden - there’s no hope whatsoever that Bernie would have been more successful in my opinion.
I genuinely like Bernie, and in general he supports good policies, but it is purest naïveté to imagine he’d be able to implement anything like the policies he champions as president.
I think he’s more effective in the role he chose: a champion of progressive policies to try to shift the discussion away from the hard right neoliberal dystopian hellscape that is most of American politics.
I admire Bernie’s achievements, drive, and character, but I think he’d be unlikely to succeed as president.
Furthermore, his failure - for whatever reasons - might contribute to the growing apathy and malaise that infects American (and all western liberal democratic) voters.
You saw the same thing happen with Obama, and the repudiation of politics by some Bernie supporters after their candidate was ousted suggests I’m not entirely wrong here.
