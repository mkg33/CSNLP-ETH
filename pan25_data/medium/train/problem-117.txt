Can't help but laugh at these idiotic comments.
China might not be democratic, but the economic interconnectedness between China and the West means that either side has (or at least SHOULD have) mutual interest in the others security, which is why China is highly likely to never start a war.
Unlike Russia, there exists an objective foundation on why we can trust China in business and it has existed for decades.
If you disagree with me then I kindly suggest you to throw out everything you own that is wholly or in parts manufactured in China.
Yeah I totally agree with you.
Here people like so much animosity, but the truth is that everyone is closely tied to China, and comparing China to a terrorist state like Putin’s Russia just because it’s a different system is ridiculous.
That said, I’m torn about how to hold nations who breach minimum human rights in their territory accountable.
I think some measures should be taken, but on the other hand there’s no way we don’t become hypocrites with that attitude.
After all, death penalty is alive and well I the US….
Oh look.
Let's move all our eggs out of the Russian basket and go and put all our eggs into the China one.
China's a stable, trusted, rule based country with little to no political influence over trade with a robust transparent elected government.
