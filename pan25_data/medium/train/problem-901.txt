But Russia is a much larger country than Ukraine, so they're going to lay siege and slowly grind Ukraine numbers down.
Their strategy seems pretty clear... create maximum hardship for Ukrainian civilians over the harsh winter, to force Zelenskyy to the negotiating table under favorable terms.
Hence Russia is also they're sending ex-prisoners, criminals, foreigners, etc.
to the front lines.
They don't care if these people die, as long as they also inflict similar casualty numbers on the Ukrainian side.
Literal cannon fodder.
Russians are really delusional if they think that fate of the commoners here bothers our authorities more than fate of russian cannon fodder bother russian authorities lol.
There won't be any negotiations as long as there are still some people alive left in the country that can be sent to fight.
And the law preventing all man from leaving ensuring the lasting supply of soldiers.
Also conditions of civs were ireelevant for them even before the war, what makes russians think that anything changed now?
As long as government (aka critical infrastructure) has the power and water, they don't care about the rest.
One of the first thing where they renewed the power - was the pipeline from Russia, and not civ infrastructure, and that says everything about their priorities.
