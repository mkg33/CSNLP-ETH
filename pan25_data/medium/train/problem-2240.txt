I was immersed in the stadium country thing in high school, it was all my friends were into (for context I was into like, High On Fire, Nine Inch Nails, The Residents, Primus, Ween, etc).
I got dragged to a few of those shows, and while the stadium country thing isn't my bag (I'm more into cosmic country, Gram Parsons and whatnot), I can see the appeal.
It's just not for me.
Rammstein, on the other hand....everyone should experience that once in their life.
I’m not even a fan of them, and I can easily see how their shows could be some of the most entertaining and fun time.

(Fun fact: I hate bro-country.
Luke Bryan was hands down the most fun I’ve ever had at a concert.
And I hate his music.
