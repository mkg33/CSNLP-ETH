This isn’t news.
They give us alarms when planes take off.
It doesn’t always mean anything is happening.
Just that it could be a plane with missiles.
They usually end rather quickly.
It’s very normal in all countries for aircraft to take off and land.
Yes.
Just didn’t go into the specifics.
It’d be nice if they could have two different alerts at least rather than the alarm and then telling us later it’s not an important one.
Like one for a threat and one for an actual attack.
I guess it's both hard to make a judgement call about the difference between a threat and an active attack but moreover it seems like doing this would cause people to dismiss or underplay the threat warning and only respond to the 'actual' attack warning.
In the apps it would be easy enough to have one that says “planes took off” and then upgrade it if there’s an actual missile launch.
Obviously the outdoor sirens shouldn’t change.
Yep exactly.
Show us proof then.

Also your post history had me and the boys rolling on the floor, it’s like a insane asylum’s community diary.
Right, it's an easy way to keep Ukrainians on board with the government by making it seem they are all about to die all the time, instead of rethinking their support of the revolutionary junta in kiev and its obsession with keeping Eastern Ukraine and expelling all the Russian speakers.
Lol Ukraine has great morale and Russia is totally empty now because everyone fled.
Putin is launching everything by himself.
