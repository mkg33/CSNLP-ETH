Although I agree, I think a budget deficit has more impact in russia than in the US.
As the US is a global hegemon there are plenty of countries willing to lend to the states.
I believe China owns the majority of the US deficit.
Essentially, as there are always buyers, then the US can print cash as it needs.
Considering russia's standing globally, there are far fewer buyers for their debt.
Even China wouldn't be interested in throwing money there if their is a risk of default.
This could strain their already strained economy and rightfully so.
As long as russian rockets can reach Ukraine the war will continue...even when the ground forces are driven out.
without their energy revenues Russia will have these deficits month after month.
who will lend them that much money?
they'll have to start printing, which will ruin the ruble.
it might not help much in that regard (foreign components will become more expensive, but not unobtainable).
but the economy falling apart around them and social services / pensions being cut would likely raise the chances of regime change quite a bit.
