Actually it looks like western insurance and shipping companies are loosing their market share and reputation.
All these sanctions help to emerge a new international business environment without us or eu control.
AFAIK Russia has already bought some amount of tankers.
Insurance is not a big deal for sure.
Really fucking stupid if you ask me.
Africa is a much better place and you can still talk some sense or money into them.
A much better place in what respect?
India is a single country with stability, security, technology, and some infrastructure.
Africa is a collection of countries, some of which do not get along with themselves or others.
Stability and security can be fleeting, investments may or may not generate returns, and that's to say nothing of the demographics.
Africa and India do not compare in my opinion.
Regardless of what the US does, I think India is poised to matter alot more in coming decades on the world stage.
It behooves the Americans to strenhen ties and cooperation if possible.
