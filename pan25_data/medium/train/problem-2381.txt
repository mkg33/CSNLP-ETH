No, it is pointing out that people have made sound arguments for not allowing morally repulsive choices, and then they get ignored because what about that muuuuney though?
Not really, they're pointing out that there are usually clear human rights issues at play that, regardless, get totally ignored by corrupt organizations.
For years leading up to the Qatar world cup, there was nonstop posting here about how terrible it was, how it shouldn't be hosted there, how it should be boycotted, and people were in great agreement about these things.
Then the actual event rolls around and you see thousands of people just going nuts about the event, and if you point out how it is a terrible outcome that shouldn't happen, you just get told to fuck off, they don't care.
People who care about human life and integrity are the ones making the noise now.
So there's great consensus about these things in response to news articles and so on.
But when the event rolls around, you'll see once again that we were never anything but a loud minority, and the typical person doesn't give a shit.
They're not here to argue with us now because they honestly don't care about any of this.
When it comes time to watch sports people do sports on a big TV, only then will they care, and all they will care about is that they get to watch the sports stuff happen.
Countries ought to be held to certain standards in order to participate on the world stage that is the Olympics.
Not using slave labor comes to mind as one of those standards... And oh yeah...not invading other countries, ought to be one of those standards as well.
That's not xenophobia, my friend.
The Olympics has long been a place for countries to exercise soft power, and influence, and it's pretty obvious to anyone who's half way intelligent, that there ought to be a code of conduct for member countries to abide by.
Unfortunately corruption and greed have caused the IOC to become bedfellows with dictators and war criminals.
