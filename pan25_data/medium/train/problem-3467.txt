NK people are known to have teeth stained green from having to eat grass due to a lack of food.
NK is definitely worse to its own people than Iran, but Iran is closing in with its own brand of fucked up.
NK is actually very resource rich, in fact for a time it was considered a very rich country but due to geopolitics and profound mismanagement it is now utterly impoverished and isolated.
China is currently becoming a hermit kingdom all its own with a healthy dose of 24/7 digital surveillance and online isolation for its people.
If they attack Taiwan they really will be cut off like Russia and N Korea, their elites are just like the ones on Russia in that they truly don't understand that consequences will hit them HARD if they follow in Russias footsteps.
They don't believe the west truly has the balls to retaliate, a mistake Russia is now paying the price dearly for.
Look at those mullahs hiding behind god as excuse to sentence teens to death and not accepting the fact that people are against the repressive regime.
