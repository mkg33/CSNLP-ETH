Trying to prosecute someone for crossing state lines is another law that of course is unconstitutional on its face as interstate travel at least currently is a fundamental right of citizenship.
But I suppose there will be no end to the creativity of state legislatures trying to circumvent the constitution.
They did a good job of circumventing the 14 th amendment for about 100 years before the Supreme Court belatedly stepped in after watching people of color having fundamental rights trampled on for the better part of a century.
So you are correct that relying on a common sense interpretation of laws would clearly not be enough for many state legislatures.
They routinely pass laws that violate the rights of their citizens and always have.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
