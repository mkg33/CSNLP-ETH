Instead of sending air defenses after the entire country has been getting leveled by Russian missiles for nearly a year?
Spin up those factories and get cranking weapons out.
Countless articles have mentioned how we weren't properly prepared for a longer duration conflict.
There's no reason these factories shouldn't be restarted and put some people to work.
Also to be clear, we maintain separate stockpiles for personal use.
Those are fine and not being drawn from.
Again, we literally keep separate stocks for defense use.
So even if any of that were from reliable sources it would be an inherently misleading statement.
And you're 100% right tactically you never let an opponent know you're low on bullets.
Oh you're fine.
You raised some excellent points yourself.
I too am tired of these misleading headlines that we are somehow running low of weapons.
Many of them that were already slated for retirement.
At this point I'm starting to think there's some truth to all the conspiracies about the US government just milking the war for the benefit of their military industrial complex.
Otherwise they would've sent air defenses before the country spent months getting bombarded, or provided Ukraine with the offensive power they keep asking for.
At least, I'd like to think they would've.
