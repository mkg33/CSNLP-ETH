The various european country (including england, not just eu) football bodies could break away to their own one and instantly end uefa.
fifa would be an empty shell - would be easy to make a new international body that way.
Not a chance of it happening, but given the distribution of money in football europe has all the power.
Hopefully 0, then again given the recent "corruption disguised as neutrality" stance of various sports organisations, who knows.
If they do surely the players at least will refuse to go.
That decision is like a soap opera.
Aparently the UAF was warned because it planned to oust its current president (who is being charged with embezzelment of football funds and corruption) and replace him with Schevchenko who apparently has close ties to Putin through Abramovich.
So the charge by FIFA is that there are outside forces pushing this (a Russian plot against the UAF).
So why move forward with a tournament in Russia if they are afraid of Russia taking over UAF?
The logic doesnâ€™t register.
I don't know what mechanisms exist to force change in the existing orgs - there must be some but no sign of anything happening to clean up the slime.
