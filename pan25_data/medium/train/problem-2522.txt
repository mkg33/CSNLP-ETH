I'm sorry for being so presumptuous to assume that you would understand the analogy here.
Let me put it into the layman's terms:
Italy is playing a card called "start peace negotiations or we'll stop giving stuff to your enemies".
Playing this card can yield several broad results as follows:
I thought the more obvious point was that peace talks are good?
With the rest of the world still sending arms to Ukraine, does it really matter that Italy stops if peace talks happen?
What's the point of not doing the peace talks?
\- Peace negotiations begin and Italy doesn't need to keep spending money.
This is called a win-win scenario even though the success of the peace talks is not guaranteed.
\- Peace negotiations do not begin, the war continues, Italian officials have a reason to keep spending money but it's still not going to end well in the long run.
This is called a lose-lose scenario because the shallow gains in political popularity can't hope to compete with the expected results from the previously outlined scenario.
The damn nonsense that I did just say was that you are an idiot for advocating for scenario 2, when everyone with a functioning network of brain cells will realize that scenario 1 is the only reasonable path.
You are the kind of tribal warrior that shouldn't be making decisions but would probably excel at following orders.
Know your place.
