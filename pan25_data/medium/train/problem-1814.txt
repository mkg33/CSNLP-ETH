Some say it hasnt started.
That they just try to find a breach and hope to deplete the reserves of Ukraine before they make a big push.
Afaik, that has been their doctrine since Stalin times, while the Germans would be very deliberate creating breakthroughs, concentrating their efforts in planned points, the Soviets would attack wider sectors and send earmarked reserves to wherever they achieved it.
It's a good tactics of you know that your officers are shite, allows for success with army they have, it also allows for lower casualties on strategic level despite that individual attacks can suffer horrendous ones.
It can be a bitch to fight against, forcing the defender to commit reserves to hold everywhere, and not even the enemy knows where they will pour across in the end.
The thing is that they started the war with trying dollar store shock and awe.
They successfully suppressed air defense network in first three days of invasion but they did not destroy it, without air dominance.
Now they seem to do dollar store soviet tactics, they assault specific part of the front at tactical level ( like Bakhamut) instead of assault across entire front lose 9/10 of battles and reinforce 1/10.
Of course it means a lot of attacks will see tons of casualties for little return, and the offensive reserve that has to exploit the breach doesn't know where it will be.
Lots of trouble either way.
