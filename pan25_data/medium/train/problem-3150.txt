I had a dream that we made some type of tech that lowered the gravity effects of a black hole to essentially 0 with some sort of frequency tech which unravelled something within it, think of it like unwrapping a present and at the bottom of it a huge monster which had huge sharp knives coming off its body and a massive planet it was on, which seemed to be inside the black hole.
We had a ship massive enough and lowered down to it, went into the hole and landed on this monster, and it wrapped its knife like arm features round the ship, and it was almost rubber like, it wouldnt squish and could change its form and we had to take off and get out before the gravity reactivated and continued to consume things around it.
It was such a weird dream but felt so real, almost like we could actually make this tech, and the ship was insane like it would move forward bit by bit, but it was so fast.
Although, I doubt a monster would be within the black hole, but then again, what do we know.
We don't know what could be inside black holes or where they could possibly go.
This is essentially what quasars are, but quasars are this from the supermassive black holes at the center of the galaxy, going on for longer periods.
Scaled up, sorta.
