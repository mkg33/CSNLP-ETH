Eh, Russia's biggest black marks at the time were Crimea(which we should've paid more attention to) and LGBT rights.
But homosexuality isn't straight up illegal in Russia and to be honest as a gay man I recognize that while a lot of Westerners are pro-LGBT most people won't stop eating a chicken sandwich over it, much less cancel their World Cup vacation.
No, this is because Qatar made the absolute worst move they could have made regarding upsetting Western sports culture by banning alcohol stadium sales at the 11th hour.
You are correct that people will use this to generalize Muslim culture and I believe it will be a long, long time before a Muslim majority nation that does not explicitly and repeatedly state its secularism will be chosen to host anything like this again, unless there is a major shift in the global powers some time soon.
Some, like me, knowing Qatar's current political climate, theocracy, and general history saw this clusterfuck coming years ago when they were selected to host.
