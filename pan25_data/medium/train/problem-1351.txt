Lol, "free trade" port that China controls.
Idk if you noticed ,but, the legislative council in Hong Kong are plants & stooges.
No one is doing anything free of Jinping's influence.
There is no such thing as autonomy in trade or manufacturing or financial or shipping, list gets pretty long.
The rule makers are no more than yes men.
"Hong Kong, China has been a WTO member since 1 January 1995 and a member of GATT since 23 April 1986.
".
That alone is already factually wrong.
Hong Kong as a UK territory has been a WTO member since 1995.
But in 1997, Hong Kong as a UK territory ceased to exist and became Hong Kong, China.
That should have prompted a revocation of status.
Yeah, that's kind of cute that you believe that, it's not remotely true.
That is not the way china operates, you make it sound like hong kong has, idk, freedoms and autonomy.
That is not the case, I am with the US government on this one.
China has repeated demonstrated through all governing matters that it is not upholding its one country two systems promise.
Hong Kong IS just another city in China.
