Well duh this will have the same effect on Western foreign aid as turning up to a job interview to work in day care with a swastika tattoo on your forehead.
I wonder how much the Taliban really plan for how they want their society to be.
Aside from the blatant human rights violations, what does this actually do for them, practically speaking?
If their actions are taken to their extreme conclusion, what do they do when all their women and youth are dead?
Their workers, their breeders, their learners and innovators?
Over whom will they rule?
For what purpose would they continue ruling when there is no one left to subjugate?
What will the leaders do when they are old?
How does this end with a functional country?
An existing country?
Not only are the Taliban hateful and violent; they are vain, short-sighted and stupid.
They will fail on their own.
It's only a shame and a tragedy that they will take uncountable innocents with them, painfully and pointlessly.
Even more funny is that the average religious extremist actually knows very little about their religion.
Think Dunning Kruger effect, they permanently reside on the peak of "Mount Stupid".
