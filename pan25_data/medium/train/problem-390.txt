Next cycle hopefully we can crush the anti-wokeness bullshit and force the Republicans back into a state of being a legitimate party with an actual policy based platform, something they haven't been for over 40 years now.
I'm fine with an opposition party existing that I disagree with.
I'm not fine with an opposition party that I find contemptuously reprehensible.

Itâ€™s a risk beyond elections, though.
Giving people like this a microphone further radicalizes voters.
We need less of that considering the potential for political violence.
It was a risk, but the payoff now is that most are going to dial back the crazy rhetoric a lot.
None of these fucksticks believed their bullshit, they were spouting it to try and get votes and it failed.
The ones who lost are going to keep it up, but they'll mostly be out of the limelight over the next two or three months.
The rest will still be trying to doom and gloom to drum up their base (which honestly, both sides pull that on their base, but Republicans doom and gloom over fictitious scenarios) but it will shift from stolen elections and qanon crazy to DeSantis' anti wokeness message.
Not that that is much better, but one thing at a time.
Oh, they'll still be some of that going around for sure after every election cycle from now on, but it won't be the singular message that a candidate runs on.
Then again, I'm just some random internet person, so I could very well be wrong.
