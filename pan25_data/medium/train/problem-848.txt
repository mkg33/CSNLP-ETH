Unlike Russia, ruled by a dictator who spent decades clearing the political landscape of any viable competitors, and thus removing whom would plunge the country into anarchy and a power struggle, in Ukraine, little would change.
Zelensky is a effective administrator and public face, and losing him might make Ukraine's PR a bit rougher (even his Russian enemies commend him on how effective his PR has been at getting Ukraine the aid it needed), but unlike Putin, he is not a one-man show.
Any of the people who are likely to replace Zelenskyy (Zaluzhny, Yermak, etc.)
are very likely to continue the same course, and Ukraine is no longer at the critical stage it was early in the invasion, where a brief power vacuum could destabilize the state apparatus and lead to a collapse or surrender.
Russia warns the West not to do what the West never intended to do to begin with.
Easy to make retribution threats for something you know you'll never need to act on.
Falls right in with pleading with the West to "avoid nuclear war," after being literally the only country making nuclear threats in the first place.
What a bunch of hypocrites.
I think back then we were speculating about Putin being seriously ill. We thought he had cancer.
I think he disappeared for a while.
Now he's canceled his end of year speech.
Could this be cover for Putin being very ill?
