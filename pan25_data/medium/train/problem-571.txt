Melina Mercouri is smiling from the afterworld!
If you don't know, among many other campaigns, she spent a big part of her life calling for the return of these relics to Greece.
The British Museum has repeatedly ruled out returning the marbles, which include about half of the 160-metre frieze that adorned the Parthenon, and insists they were legally acquired.
True but the British claim on them is essentially i wanted them so i bought them.
The greek claim is its there history.
I tend to side with the greek people on this one.
Possible solution take a high res 3d scan of it send the original back to greece and then build a copy.
To the avrage person viewing it it wpuld be the sMe thing.
The only people that would be able to tell its a fake would be people that specialize marble sculptures.
They could do a copy whenever they want.
A lot of stuff you see outside is a copy, or is a "fake", aka a restoration that has not much of the original in it anymore.
If they want the original I don't side with them.
They sold them, if they want them back they buy them, only if the British are willing to sell.
and it was Greece the peninsula, not Geerce the nation.
That was born, ironically, because of the extreme hellenophilia from the west, especially England, that fuelled nationalism and greek identity in Greece in the modern era.
