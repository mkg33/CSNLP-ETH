Conservatives have NEVER been pro-life, because being pro-life means you have to care about the well being of others.
They've yet to demonstrate they give a shit about anything other than power and the ability for them to be able to hate on minorities (just look at the LGBTQ+ moral panic going on right now.)
They say they hate "grooming and pedophiles" and yet what do they oppose?
Sex education, which has been proven in study after study to lower the chances of a child being taken advantage of.
After all it's harder to trick them if they know what is going on.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
