The Tasmanian tiger has no such close relative to work with because their family tree diverged hundreds of thousands of years ago.
and because the DNA samples are so degraded and fragmented from either tanning or formaldehyde, and most DNA in general is useless or outdated code, genetically fossilized viruses, and other biological "bloatware", one has to carefully pick through the entire genome for the relevant snippets which actually code for "Tasmanian tiger" and inject them into another species embryo.
As Andrew Pask the director of the project put it, it's like trying to put together a puzzle of a clear blue sky with no image on the box to work from and a pile of extra spare pieces.
