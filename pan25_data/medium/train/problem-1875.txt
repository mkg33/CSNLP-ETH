Depends which military - the "actual" military, no probably not.
The Belarusian legions fighting with Ukraine that are planning to go back once this is over to go do some changes at home?
Probably very good.
If they called Ukraine a terrorist, they would have to back it up.
The just said they are not dealing with a terrorist.
They aren't in NATO, so they don't have to follow proper protocol either.
no.
thats a " terrorist threat " you are talking about.
an " anti terrorist threat " is one that threatens terrorists.
so belarus is the terrorists.
or its just bad translation in the article .
dealing with an anti-terrorist threat makes them the terrorists.
the belarusians.
they called themselves terrorists.
"On December 7, the Belarusian government announced the transfer of military equipment in an attempt to deal with the "anti-terrorist threat".
".
Yes, I understood you just fine.
Dealing with an anti-terrorist threat would make them the opponents of those who fight terrorism.
Like the United States.
