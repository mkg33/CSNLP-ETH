Instead of, you know, letting them go the day of and then having to spend billions of dollars to investigate after the fact who was there.
I'm wondering how much of the extreme polarization in US politics has to do with it.
Can you imagine the general Repub reaction if the Dems just went straight at it like this?
I'd hazard a guess that they are wanting a slow boil approach to avoid as much public interest as possible, at least until they are ready to bring the hammer down.
When these deeds go unpunished they are bound to be repeated.
Bolsonaristas here are saying that Lula is being harsh.
People who try a coup will always say those things.
Looking at Brazil's history: We had a military coup in 1964, the dictatorship ended in 1985 and there was a general amnisty to all military involved, meaning not one of the tortures and murderes went to jail.
Argentina, on the other hand, punished the ones involved in their dictatorship.
Bolsonaro became popular by saying that the dictatorship was amazing since the 90s, that it wasn't as bad as the pro democracy people claim to be, and that slowly corroded people's minds over the years.
If we had put to jail all the pro dictatoship military, and if we had made it a crime to defend the dictatorship, Bolsonaro would have lost his political power decades ago.
In order for true democracy to exist, we cannot tolerate the intolerable, for history will pay back with interest when we let that slide.
