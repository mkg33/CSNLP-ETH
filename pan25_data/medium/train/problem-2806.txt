Didn't the British do this in India with cobras?
The locals started breeding cobras to kill them for money and when the British stopped the scheme the breeders released all of their cobras and there were like 10x as many cobras.
I don't care about the brits doing something in India hundreds of years ago, as that is not news.
Also we're not debating the efficiency of the brits in wiping out cobras vs the efficiency of the arabs killing dogs, so yes, thank you for stepping in but the subject here is dogs being butchered in Hebron RIGHT NOW because of their savage mayor.
Obviously he hasn't read anything from history, when something similar happened with Snakes If I Recall Correctly... and people were just breeding them to sell to the government.
if these dog murderers risk persecution however Sweden will welcome them in as asylum seekers then shout the modern "Ni" (Racist) to anyone who disagrees.
I've spend several minutes searching for something to support your claim on google, and also asked in few animal activist groups on social media.
Nothing so far.
Fact?
Who said that this is a fact?
Please provide evidence to your claim, as I had never heard of this before.
Israel has very strict laws in this matter.
Please provide proof for your claim, if there are israeli authorities doing what you said we would like to know more about it so that we can act accordingly.
If not, at least be kind and admit that you were spreading fake news.
