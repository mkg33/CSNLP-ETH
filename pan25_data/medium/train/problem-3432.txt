That's better than I would have expected given the literally thousands of players who have cycled through the position over the years, and the fact that he played the first 3 years of his pro career in the USFL (where he was league MVP).
I now believe he was better as a pro than I had thought.
Oh, I laugh at The Trade, which I describe as Dallas trading Walker for 3 Super Bowl titles, but Walker gets beat up on as a player more than he deserves -- in large part, I think, because of that trade, which would have been nearly impossible to live up to.
He was a fine pro running back who would be starting on almost every team in the league now were he transplanted in time.
Instead he's making a fool out of himself and Georgia, while being a threat to the country.
At least as a player he was only a threat to the Vikings.
