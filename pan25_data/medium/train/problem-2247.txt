We all knew they wouldn't care about the HIV thing because it was affecting the "right" people, but you'd think they would care about someone costing states and the federal government millions of dollars through sheer negligence.
But hey, they still support cops that cost cities and states millions of dollars a year through negligence, so I guess they are consistent at least.
