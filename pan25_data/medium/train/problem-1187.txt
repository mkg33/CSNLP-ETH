While the US and NATO in general are throwing a lot of money at the situation, they still want to be as economical as possible, and not just throw money away...
So there's still going to be an ROI factor for every decision to set up a specific defense system... My guess is also that the Phalanx just isn't economically effective at defending something larger than say an aircraft carrier... Maybe you can put two of these on a carrier an be pretty well protected - but how many would you need to protect a large city like Kyiv?
10?
20?
100?
I have no idea... but that's gotta cost a shitload, and the US probably doesn't just have 20 Phalanx systems sitting around in a warehouse collecting dust, where other system we do.
Honestly I think they’ll be able to do it cheaper with high volume computer assisted machine gun fire or computer guided anti drone electronic warfare weapons.
Missiles are expensive but a tracked weapon that either doesn’t need reloading or costs a fraction of a missile is coming.
