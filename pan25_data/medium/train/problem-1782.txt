Who would’ve thought?
China is kindly stepping forward to support Australia against a threat that doesn’t exist, I’m guessing they’re after a “Belarus” state.
It’s a response to the perceived historical mistreatment by successive Australian and NZ govts.
They haven’t provided them enough attention or support (in their eyes) citing ongoing instability, nepotism and corruption in island govts.
They know that strategically with AUKUS, 5 eyes and recent instability in “South China sea” that Australia, NZ and others in the region cannot allow China to obtain the influence/foothold they have achieved further north.
The recent “naval base” and police support in The Solomons was a big eye opener and has driven a lot of behavioural change at a cabinet level.
Solid play by them pacific islands.
Just because there is restoration of high-level meetings between Australia and China does not mean Australia should let its guard down.
When the Chinese ambassador made comment that Japan may attack Australia in the future like it did in the past, I just laughed.
China is like Russia.
It will try to lure you with sweet talk and favorable trade deal and when the moment is right, weaponize it to get what they want as Australia found out.
