Slighty different tech but the local wastewater treatment plant I worked at had one whole building using PLC5 version of Rockwell software(designed in the 80s).
Anytime it went down, it was a massive issue getting a replacement part.
Also there were 30+ years of improvements done on the equipment, without any documentation.
I don't work there anymore but still talk to my old co-workers.
Apparently they are doing upgrades and its becoming a huge issue.
