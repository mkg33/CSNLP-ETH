You mean western countries, not the world even a lot of Eastern European countries like Poland is having a close relationship with Turkiye in terms of defensive and military projects same goes for Ukraine they have many military tech corporations with ASELSA.
What I say is if this happens it just means Turkiye will soon be totally independent in making their own weapon they will no longer need F35 as the TF-X will replace it but will as for the US to give back the 1.4 billion dollars they give to buy F35.
That solves nothing just speeds up Turkiye TF-X program more it was supposed to fly in 2025 now they are saying it will be flying in 2024 same with Kizimale was supposed to fly in 2023 but already stated flight back in late 2022.
You don't have to read any articles on Sweden's membership untill something definitive actually happens.
Saved you some time.
Turkey will never make a jet comparable to the f-35.
If China and Russia can’t make anything comparable to it, no way can turkey.
Making a cost effective drone for countries that can’t make their own does not translate into making an aerospace industry that rivals America.
You’re delusional.
