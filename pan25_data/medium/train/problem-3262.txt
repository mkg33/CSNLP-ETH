this comment thread seems to be conflating a lot of issues.
title 42 refers to asylum seekers, who before it was enacted only 2 years ago, were legally allowed to be in the usa while awaiting their asylum hearings.
there are a lot of issues with the asylum process and current situation and that is one discussion to be had.
this has nothing to do with sanctuary cities, 'open borders', undocumented migrants, seasonal migrants, overstayed visas, or border security in general.
those are all topics that require separate discussions on their own.
