Renewable power that is spread across individual homes or apartment buildings is also resilient against war or terrorism damage to centralized power systems.
Though, for emergency purposes the system needs to be capable of functioning in "island mode".
Some of the cheaper grid-tie solar power controllers can only function if the external power network is available, and won't work at all without it.
Lithium is not the only option for off-grid battery storage.
Banks of huge heavy lead-acid batteries similar to forklift batteries have been used for the last century, and it is commonly available.
The energy storage and cycle life is not as good as lithium, but an old lead battery is easily melted down and entirely recycled into new lead batteries.
Solar thermal collection of heat for building heating in the winter, producing free hot water, or for heating swimming pools in the summer is also possible using an evacuated tube solar thermal collector.
It is possible for this to work without external power or electric pumps as a thermosiphon.
Nuclear isn't taking off like renewables are for a reason.
Some of it is down to unfounded fears, sure, but the main factor is simply that it costs more to build slower.
It doesn't offer the same bang for your buck that solar and wind do.
Now that's not to say that nuclear is bad or useless, just that as renewables are in this explosive growth phase and continue to get cheaper they're going to justifiably be the focus.
Alternatives like nuclear, hydro, and thermal are still important to keep the grid stable because expecting to bruteforce our way to victory using a fuck-ton of grid-scale battery packs is silly.
Build some of those alternatives on the side.
And if you already have them?
Where possible, keep 'em!
