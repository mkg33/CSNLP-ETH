The entire idea of 'exceptions' are completely bogus and often used to placate people.
As soon as you think about it, exceptions don't work.
If a girl is raped, what will it take to prove she was raped in order to grant an 'exception'?
A court case granting a guilty verdict?
That would take months or years to play out.
Please stop with the 'rape or incest exceptions' altogether- they are not feasible and solely used as a bogus bargaining chip to people who are on the fence about abortion bans and news outlets.
Exceptions don't work!
Just stop taking away half the country's rights and all this can end.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
