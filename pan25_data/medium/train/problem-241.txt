Voting should be done for ideas, not appearances/sex/height/perceived maculinity.
Or even political experience (a non-political experience liberal is better than a highly experienced but fascist conservative).
Not even for how affable you are.
A quiet or awkward person with good ideas and is massively better than a "celebrity" personality who's "fun" but who has bad ideas.
Can't believe I'm 26 and that adults up to 60s years older than me choose appearance and personality over ideas.
And they're the ones who say "I'm older so I know better than you".
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
