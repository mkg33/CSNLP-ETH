Not Russia... the Kremlin.
There's a distinction that should be made.
There's really no need to hate on all Russians.
But there's plenty of reasons to hate the bastards in the Kremlin who control everything and keep Putin in power.
Russia is a dictatorship, lets be honest.
The people have little say outside of a revolution, and that may come yet.
Let’s not pretend that most of the general public cared until it directly affected them.
Yes, there’s minority opposition, but let’s be honest - the majority of Russians like a strong, authoritarian leader in charge.
No one really cared until it was clear this would actually come at a cost to Russians.
But if you go back that far then Kiev and the region formerly Novgorod should be put together as well.
And those cities were ruled and the strenh their famous for built by Norse invaders.
The Rurikids were the Norse who founded the Kieven-Rus people and, like I said, if you’re looking to go back that dar for justification you’re just reeeeeeally stretching because the sheer scope of what happened between then and now.
