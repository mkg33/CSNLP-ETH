If someone needs to be blamed, blame opec for cutting supply and making things expensive, they are the ones who are really minting money.
( they did as a sign of rebellion against petro dollar so they can have their trades more independent, and less expensive ( transaction expenses, conversion, etc ) ).
1) US is now the top buyer of Indian refined petroleum products (they're buying a lot of refined Russian oil through India).
2) UAE is the second biggest buyer now for India for refined oil, so I'm not surprised India is dealing using some dirhams now.
What's most likely happening is that India is getting dirhams for UAE for refined oil and then India is using those same dirhams to buy Russian oil to refine later.
India is also where most of the petroleum products that the US exports ends up.
Sure, some of the refined oil comes from Russia, but we sell them shit, they refine it and then we buy shit back.
We sell them more than we buy from them.
And whatâ€™s wrong in trading in other currencies?
Is taking independent decisions anti west?
Or anti ukraine?
