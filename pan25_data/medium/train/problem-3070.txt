And if people say that that territory was once part of long gone state which later become India.
Then same people should say Taiwan belongs to China because it once belonged to Qing Dynasty and PRC is continuation of Chinese government just like India is continuation of governments before.
But sereously the fact that there ist still hand to hand combat over borders and its even mutually agreed there will be no shooting ist baffling.
Since on that border modern weapons are forbidden... Do they now get cool real medival gear or all the mall ninja gear they US can spare?
I mean what the actual f China.
If you got your poop together you could dominate the world economically then the rest is moot.
Getting involved in these petty land/water disputes reveals how truly weak you are.
Thing is India or China is fighting over some rocky hills of no value which do no belong to either side when you thunk about it.
But both sides have claims.
And if anyone actually saw the footage there is nothing there.
Rocks and grass and hills.
