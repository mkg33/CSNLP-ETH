Ahhh you see the Chinese think they're getting a bargain, that they will feast on the juicy juicy bones of the great USSR.
Instead they'll get to economically support a black hole of corruption and terrible geography that requires billions in infrastructure and tech transfer just to build a railroad.
Sprinkle in centuries of unresolved ethnic relations in Central Asia and you're more likely to end up with the Chinese version of 9/11 than with a new sphere of influence.
Russia sells itself as a classic hotrod you can buy at a bargain when what you're really getting is an outdated Lada with terrible milage, a shitty engine that leaks everywhere, and seats that you can't get the crocodil smell out of.
That would be, I feel, a better strategy if they weren't currently engaged in a war that has so far cost them 50-80% of their entire military's functional, tank, apc, ifv, attack helicopter, artillery round, strike fighter plane, transport vehicle, and cruise missile supplies... on top of 60-85k dead (at 400-900/day) 2-3x wounded soldiers, majority of which were their trained troops, and now are trending down in training level, whilst Ukraine continues to grow in strenh and training level...
