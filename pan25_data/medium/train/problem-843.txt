Obama didn't think he was a democrat, he thought he was a candidate McConnell would be willing to vote for, because McConnell brought Obama a list of judges he'd vote for, and Garland was on it.
Garland is a republican.
People constantly overlook this.
Biden believed in bipartisanship, chose a republican to run the DOJ, and now we will see him do republican things: protect everyone with an R.
