From my subjective perspective, this is doubtful.
Japan was the friend of the guy, who razed Poland for some puny concept of territory.
Til today, many poles still carry a grudge for their treatment.
Especially since England's "appeasement" doctrine did nothing but betray Poland.
Maybe it wasn't realistic, but it was a dead serious message for the Poles to Japan what they think of friends of their destroyers.
The Polish government-in-exile only declared war on Japan after Japan began fighting the Western powers.
Before that, Japan had fairly good relations with Poland and disapproved of the conquering of Poland and even continued sharing intel with the exiled government.
As they were being "hosted" in England while in exile, Japan considered them to have no choice in declaring war when England also declared war on Japan.
it's not that dissimilar from the US's attitude to Thailand during the war, where they mostly just pretended that Thailand declaring war on the united states didn't really happen.
