Until major organizing and fundraising by Stacey Abrams, Georgia was considered out of reach for Democrats but then 2020 happened.
National democrats (not just the DNC) really need to make substantial investments in capable and committed local organizers in battleground states and not just flood money into impermanent individual campaigns every two years.
I don’t dispute that’s correct but that’s not to say a Democrat winning is impossible in all circumstances.
I mean that's not saying much.
Incumbency is extremely powerful.
When random politically inactive people (by that I mean not particularly informed on politics, no particular inclination one way or the other, etc.)
get their ballot and the choice is between the current person who has been there for decades or some random nobody they know nothing about, many, if not most are going to vote for the known quantity.
For no other reason than the recognition granted by their incumbency.
