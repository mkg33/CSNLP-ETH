“The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.
Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council.
Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security.”.
Even if it was a Russian missile, it was an accident most likely, and with no ongoing "attack" there will be no use for article 5, article 4 on the other hand....
Article 4 of the NATO treaty covers the case when a member state feels threatened by another country or a terrorist organization.
The 30 member states then start formal consultations at the request of the threatened member.
The talks look at whether a threat exists and how to counter it, with decisions arrived at unanimously.
This is the important piece here and I suspect the result is more equipment for Ukraine and potentially NATO anti-air assets on the polish border, covering a good part of Ukraine as well.
I’m completely okay with them getting more anti missile weapons especially after the missile attack today.
