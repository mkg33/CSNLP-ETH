It is all wishful thinking.
There is only the hint from their complete failure of a military campaign against Ukraine.
Well.
It wasn’t really a lack of material that caused that.
If anything Ukraine proves that you can use old machines pretty well.
Besides as it turns out the Europeans have also not been maintaining their tanks did they?
Anyway, the point is that they do not have a good army in terms of organization.
And just maintaining a nuke is not easier maybe or cheaper for that matter, but it is a different matter all together.
Corruption could have affected those nukes.
Sure.
But we do not know.
It is grasping at straws for all I know.
What we do know is that they have always been a bit nuts about the subject.
A bit obsessed let’s say.
So if anything that gives reason to believe that they have plenty in working order.
Actually if you want or need to be hopeful it is more reasonable to believe that the USA has the means to destroy a lot of them before they can be used.
But personally I wouldn’t bet on that either.
It is a very big country and they have mobile launchers.
Now there is a reason of course why we can gamble it is all bluff.
Not because there are no nukes there.
It is because we also have a lot of them with a bit more of a guarantee that they work and can be delivered.
For less than 2% of one years worth of the US military budget, the west has aided Ukraine in fight the Russian military to a stand still.
Imagine if Putin fires a nuke and US and NATO open a can of whoop ass, how many hours until Russia’s nuclear capability is degraded to zero.
Only if it comes on over engineered letterhead with impossible font tolerances and random electrical problems the longer you hold it.
