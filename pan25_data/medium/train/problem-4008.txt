As a tall person this is my worst nightmare.
Wall to wall beds without any possibility to lay straight at any point is torture.
The floors are probably too humid to sleep on too, leaving no choice.
I agree, I am smoking right now in a country it is illigal in - it carries a 14 year sentance but more likley an $100 fine.
But I wouldn't bring drugs across international borders and the world is immoral, wishing it isn't is great an all but the status quo is what it is.
If you have a vice, you better find out of it is even allowed where you are going, and it's penalties.
If they are too stiff don't go, or at least don't participate.
Never, ever, ever take anything that could be construed as controversial through an airport.
You want something?, get some after you have landed.
Oh and no souvenirs to bring back either.
Other places do not play by our rules.
lol.
i got no sympathy for this woman.
maybe she will learn her lesson.
if any other person on this planet were to take cannabis to russia the narrative would be much different, but most likely non-exsistant.
she now gets to learn that she isnt special and the same rules apply to her as everyone else on the planet.
what a dumb fucking moron to take drugs to a foreign country there is not really anything else to say about it.
Lol.
You go ahead and go to Russia with weed and see how the news articles go for you.
Lol.
This woman is more than a pawn she is a moron because she is screwed now.
Nobody gonna save you from the gulag.
She shouldn’t even have weed where she lives in America.
She just thinks the laws don’t apply to her.
Why should I care about somebody that’s thinks the rules don’t apply to them?
