Weird right?
In fact many elderly people in china are skeptical because of botched vaccinations they experienced themselves and/or stories of botched vaccinations that have happened to others.
I was as surprised as you to hear about this because china projects that it has absolute control over it’s citizens but that doesn’t seem to be the case.
There are over a billion people in china and it’s fair to say that far from all feel love for the government and it’s lackluster attitude towards human rights.
Trying to find an excuse to ease the extremely unpopular and strict Covid measures in China without admitting the CCP was ever in the wrong.
As in “well these measures were necessary for the original Covid but it’s mutated so now these measures aren’t needed for this new one”.
It’s almost like acknowledging that a largely vaccinated populace with the way the modern version of the disease works would warrant changing policy.
Why the fuck are they still so afraid of it?
Is it not way less lethal than it was?
