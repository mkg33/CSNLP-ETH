Are Republicans barred from supporting this policy when they don't control these parts of government?
I'm all for blaming Joe Manchin here at home, since we have to accept that Republicans are never going to vote for anything positive.
But when it comes to explaining ourselves to an international audience, it's important that they realize we are 100% hamstrung by the Republicans and that it is only half of the country to blame.
We don't even have the political will for robust domestic measures so it's not surprising that we couldn't shore up support for billions of dollars to help foreign countries with a problem that nearly half of our political establishment is still actively claiming doesn't exist.
