There may have been an argument before Trump that Republicans actually cared about the government budget.
It's hard to look at their sycophantic support for Trump--a horrible businessman who sponged off the government as Presodent and is sponging off of his supporters now--and think they give a damn about anything besides helping the rich and getting theirs.
