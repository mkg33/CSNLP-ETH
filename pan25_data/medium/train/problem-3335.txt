May 7, 2022 "I worry laws post-Roe won't reflect what infant intensive care can accomplish: It does not guarantee survival, and it often means life-long disabilities.

It's about two women's regrets over ending their own unviable pregnancies.
They wanted live babies.
The doctors told them that the fetuses wouldn't survive.
Palliative care exists for newborns for this very reason.
These people are so fucked up they want a newborn with severe deformities who will die regardless to be hooked up to machines and stuck with needles while the parents watch horrified instead of letting them decide what path to take.
And no fetus is surviving an abortion.
It’s another made up republican medical “fact” like partial birth abortions.
