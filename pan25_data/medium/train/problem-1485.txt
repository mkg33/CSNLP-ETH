The DOJ?
Oh they love me at the DOJ they can't get enough of me.
Always calling my lawyers, always sending me certified mail.
Mr. President, Sir, they say, we can't get enough of you, they really say that you know.
We're obsessed with you.
Please come hang out with us and give a statement under oath, they say.
Pretty weird.
Those DOJ guys are so weird.
Too busy trying to hang out with me and get my autograph that they don't even investigate Dirty Joe Biden and his very corrupt kids.
People say that, you know, very corrupt kids.
I don't say it.
But people do.
Very strange.
If they want to see me on TV they can just watch this rally, am I right?
