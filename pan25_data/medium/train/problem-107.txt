Yup.
I think people really screwed this one up by not listening to the scientists and deciding the pandemic was over prematurely.
I have a feeling that long term we're going to find out how damaging covid is.. especially if this is like an Epstein Barr virus that can cause other illnesses down the line.
I just got back from spending some time in Antarctica.
Scientists are waiting for this avian flu time.
Penguins nest in colonies of up to 400,000+ in places like St. Andrews bay in South Georgia Island.
An avian flu outbreak there could kill penguins by the millions.
Just get a bunch of youtubers to do it, they'll milk that content opportunity to the last penguin.
Like and subscribe for more avian flu vaccine videos!
But then you'll get a bunch of fake videos from youtubers not showing their face and using text to speech voice overs chasing chickens with syringes full of salt water.
Yup, I honestly believe that if everyone complied from the beginning, we'd be in a much better place.
And also as the WHO has stated, selfish countries hoarding vaccines (which half the population refused anyway) while other countries had no vaccines at also is a big part of the issue.
No going back now though.. Just have to live with it and hope no dangerous variants pop up again.
We are also starting to see other diseases that were once eradicated coming back because of all this anti-vax b/s.
