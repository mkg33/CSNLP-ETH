I don’t see any problem as far as police and EMS vehicles go.
There are already EVs of that size available and used (for delivery).
Some fire trucks might be too big, but their fleet also includes lots of smaller vehicles.
In Europe, police, fire and EMS vehicles travel lots of short distances.
As for the military, their business is killing people in wasteful ways.
I don’t think they’re interested in fighting climate change.
The title is technically correct but can be confusing.
From 2035 new cars need to reduce their CO2 emissions by 100% compared to 2021, so zero emissions.
Any car with an internal combustion engine, including hybrids, will have CO2 coming out of the exhaust and is banned.
With our current technology that leaves electricity, either from a battery or a fuel cell.
Burning hydrogen doesn't create CO2 afaik so I'm not sure if that means it's still allowed.
It's not something car makers are really working on anyway.
It doesn't work by passing laws.
This will either be irrelevant or laughably off the mark.
Everyone is trying the best they can it seems.
Either the physics and economics works or it doesn't.
Ok, so how did all these EV manufacturers even get started in the mandate is only being passed right now?
A more constructive mandate would be to require every apartment unit be provided with its own charging.
If the charging doesn't materialize, then mandating only EV's is ridiculous.
