Yeah they fcking deserved it it's not just handing a candy, but they won't be killed since the death penalty is banned in algeria, so they will just get life in prison and get out When the presidential exemption arrives.
I see...I agree they are vile and deserve it .
yet I generally oppose death/torture as a punishment and think it should be used very sparingly if not at all.
I hope they don't get exempted in the same breath and finish their miserable lives in prison.
i think death penalty being banned is a good reflection of a country.
So nice one for that Algeria 🙏.
Yep .
I wish for such scum to not exist yet death penalty being enforced as standard and common practice is not a society I'd like to be in...and I'm no criminal 😅 those people are emotional.
Yeah i agree a little but the people are really not happy with it, every time a horrible crime happens they protest so the government would bring back the death penalty.
U can't really blame them for it because these protests usually happen after a crime committed against kids or women, and trust me sometimes they are unbelievably horrifying.
