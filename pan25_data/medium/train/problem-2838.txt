The biggest takeaway from this article is that the author doesn't understand that Jack Smith will investigate and prosecute any criminals that were overlooked in the Jan 6 committee report.
The J6C committee narrowed their search and culpability to Trump.
The ground up approach Garland is doing would take literally a decade for them to finally get to Trump.
Which is what every “leader” of the Coup was counting on if it didn’t work.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
The Jan 6 Report kept Politics out of their findings.
They put many nails in Trump's Coffin.
But, left every one else for the DOJ to deal with.
They have given them all their Dirt.
The next year will show us what they do with it.
Exactly right.
Garland was/is foot dragging this case because they’re playing politics under the guise of ground up prosecution.
Now, Jack Smith has a direct, very very public, blue print of how to arrest Trump.
Working from top down while Garland continues to muddle along.
