I begin by admitting I am coming from a background where I was indoctrinated into a church that not only claims American exceptionalism at its core, but that exact statement is a canonized, foundational document——and holds on to the idea that they, and they alone continue to have the ear of deity.
The Latter Day Saints claim that all other churches are not only wrong, but abominable in the sight of deity.
If one accepts that premise, then the next step is still not that easy.
All of the possible beliefs have been written down on paper, cut up into slips, put into a hat, and pulled out at random to form the basis for a new and improved one-true-church, .
Will the church practice polygamy?
It will if the tenet makes the powerball lottery cut.
Feel free to share political cartoons in this thread.

If people actually believe "the media" does that, they should watch Ari Melber on MSNBC.
He definitely doesn't do that.
He has media literacy threads running through his pieces fairly frequently.
He's not a basher.
