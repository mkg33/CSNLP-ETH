Montana runs on an undercurrent of libertarianism and a general attitude of "just leave me alone and stay out of my business."
It's still a red state and we have plenty of frustrating setbacks and hard loses, but many people here (including a lot of Republicans) genuinely believe in freedom from government meddling.
This election, Montana also voted down a terrible law that targeted people who receive abortions, miscarry, or otherwise give birth to babies who cannot survive.
We also amended our constitution to specifically protect one's electronic data from unreasonable search and seizure.
We're not all bad!

it was missoula’s district which is a very left leaning college town- but still a huge win!
so exciting as a fellow trans person that this is even feasible.
I was stoked to vote for Zooey!
I am disappointed about how red Montana is becoming and I’m alarmed by the republican’s tactics in our state but I am proud Zooey won.
Montana used to be more purple, but the governor and our embarrassment of a senator have been really successful at courting rich republicans to our state.
Missoula continues to be the only livable town in Montana for a left leaning person lol.
