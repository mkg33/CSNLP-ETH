I think resource allocation is part of the issue.
If you have, let's say $1000 in the coffers (obviously not the real amount, just for ease of illustration), and you can go after 10 tax cases at $100/case and get an average of $250/case, or you can prosecute one high-level filing that will require a $10000/day federal court case, it doesn't matter how many millions a successful case could potentially yield as you simply don't have the funds to pursue it.
The entire legal system is fundamentally broken along financial lines.
This is just one manifestation of it.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
