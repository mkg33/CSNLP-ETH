what I find interesting is that their "debunk" response video and statement of "room full of books" still seems to show what looks like 30%-50% of the shelves being empty in the "full" section.
like... it almost looks the same as when a department store is going out of business and closing but hasn't told anyone so they fill all the shelves with single large packs of paper towels all the way at the front of the shelf to make it seem like the store still has full shelves...
Heinlein was also accused of being a racist which is somewhat unfair - a large part of that rap is down to JW Campbell (who really was very racist indeed) which resulted in stuff like “sixth column”.
Part of it was the time and place he was from doing him absolutely no favours.
To his credit Heinlein actually did his best later to try come at race from what he thought was a progressive angle … but he wasn’t remotely well equipped or informed enough for the task and got it rather badly wrong on more than one occasion.
Points for good intentions but then promptly loses most of them for execution.
