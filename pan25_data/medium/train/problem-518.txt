Joe wants this because it'll give him an edge in the unlikely event he receives a primary challenger.
I get that but I disagree with his preference.
I say make the first state Michigan or Pennsylvania, something like that.
Those two are must-win states and giving them precedence in helping determine a nominee would be a wise choice.
I don't think it should be South Carolina, because why should a state that hasn't voted Democratic since Jimmy Carter in 1976 and voted for Trump by double digits both times get the first say in who the party nominates?
That said, maybe someday we could have all fifty states have their primaries/caucuses at once.
Maybe have four months of campaigning from January to April then a Super Duper Tuesday in May or something to determine the nominee.
I know it's not gonna happen in 2024 but wouldn't it be tidier?
