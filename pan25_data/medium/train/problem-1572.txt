It's the exact opposite of a superiority complex.
Whilst burning someone's flag or holy book or whatever is just petty and a deliberate act to incite hate, its got nothing to do with being superior.
Iylts a statement saying that "your superiority means nothing to us".
Like I said, petty.
I mean, I wouldn't like it if somone burned my countries flag, I can see being upset about somone burning your holy book.
But it's still within their right to do so, and restricting free speech that isnt inciting violence or slanderous is far more offensive to me than anything else.
Because some people that don’t believe in their religion have an exaggerated superiority complex that makes them think that’s ok to disrespect someone believes only because their are different.
Does everyone remember that time a dozen Turkish bodyguards in Washinon DC beat up both Turkish nationals and US citizens protesting erdogans visit during the trump years?
Beating up protestors in America’s capital.
And received zero consequences.
Thanks Donny, very free speech.
