Capitalism is what drives women's rights.
A stay at home mother is a person who isn't maximally contributing to the capitalist system.
Perhaps if America had invested in Afghanistan by entering into resource extraction partnerships, women would have had a chance.
Instead, Bush, Obama, Trump, and Biden only cared about the bullshit stories they could get in the news, about how 15 Afghan women graduated college.
Well, there's no colleges in Afghanistan and no jobs for college educated people.
Birthing pods with no medical care, because they say male doctors can't see female patients, but they don't want women to be doctors and nurses anymore either....
Yeah and the part that's really interesting is that the population doubled in the 20 years between Taliban control.
They went from 20 million to 40 million and they have been experiencing droughts recently as well.
It's estimated that more than 50% of Afganies are experiencing food shortages.
I'm not too sure the Taliban can stave off mass famine without the help of the NGOs.
The future of Afganistan really looks dim.
