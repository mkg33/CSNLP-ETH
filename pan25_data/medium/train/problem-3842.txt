I disagree with this.
Humans are not good at acting rationally especially when their lives are in danger.
If you give people the chance they will drag their feet, be indesisive, or flee.
This can be extremly problomatic in a wartime situation.
Mass shooters could easily be taken down if their victims banded together and defended themselves.
But instead their victims act in their own interest and run.
If there was someone to organize them they could likley get away with less casualties.
There isnt anything wrong with fleeing when your not organized, its the right thing to do, but when your talking about that happening on a massive international scale you have a war that could easily be winnable turn into unorganized chaos that could very well cost more lives than an initial conflict with a healthy reserve of disciplined soldiers.
Its war and people have to die, if you give them the chance to choose for themselves, they will rarely choose to sacrafice themselves.
That being said nations shouldnt go to war unless their sovereignty is at stake in the first place, and granted they have a just place as a sovereign nation to begin with.
Glad we're using takes of random people off the street for headlines though.
Good job CNN, way to stoke fear.
