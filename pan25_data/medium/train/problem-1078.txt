The phrase "science has found" is deeply sus here, on account of yeah obviously this was always gonna be true just from chemical first principles.
Combined with the fact that energy per CO2 isn't the only relevant metric to consider, though, that means somebody's blatantly trying to cherry-pick or possibly even manufacture results (albeit real ones) to support a cause here.
Because if you burn a bunch of fuel, creating CO2, then remake the fuel and put it back where you found it, you didn't increase the amount of carbon in the air.
Remaking coal and burying it is hard, energy intensive and mostly impractical.
You need a bunch of carbon capture technology to filter the CO2 out of the air, and it has to run on something that doesn't make more CO2.
Remaking trees, on the other hand, is relatively straightforward; you plant trees where they were before you cut them for fuel, they grow using sunlight.
Yes, the point of the research underpinning all this is that trees don't grow fast enough to recapture all the CO2 released from burning trees in a meaningful time frame, our climate is cooked long before trees planted today mature in 30-50 years.
These pellets are often made of by-products from the forestry industry, so the alternative is that they're just discarded as a waste material.
When people say "coal is better" they're not factoring in that you have to create tonnes of emissions just to extract coal, whereas the pellets are created from a waste material that is going to be produced regardless of whether it's used for energy.
