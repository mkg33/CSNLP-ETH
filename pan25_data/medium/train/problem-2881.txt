Codifying a right to abortion nationally is that much easier and people aren't idiots, they know that if things continue to swing right with the current day manifestation of the GOP that they will not stop at abortion and it will only be a harder fight.
It will absolutely effect the run off, of course it will - people are emotional creatures, the fact that the right just got fucking spanked over trying to take us back to the last century and are still going hard for trying to pass laws that are going to kill women is what takes precedence.
Because there is zero chance of codifying the right to abortion.
There isn't 60 votes, and Democrats won't bust the filibuster for it.
Most folks know that.
The election will be about kitchen table stuff.
Like inflation, housing, food etc.
No 60+ is a smackdown and generational change, let's not underestimate what it will really take to get there - which is years of voter engagement and the left continuing to rise to the occasion.
And just because dems will lack 60 votes does not mean that this will not continue to keep their base engaged on these issues - the opposite effect in republican voters in rural areas was actually noticed for the mid term election, so I wonder what the timing of this will do to their enthusiasm combined with the piss poor showing on the midterms overall for what was supposed to be a red tsunami, as they say.
