There is nothing unusual about this, SpaceX are just covering their asses legally, and also thinking about what's best for them financially.
If SpaceX knowingly allows Starlink to be integrated into non-US weapons systems, it likely becomes military tech that falls under ITAR which means exporting it requires US government approval.
They can get approval, but that'll take time and will also cause its own set of problems for Starlink; namely, how to keep selling it to civilians if it's now classified as restricted military technology.
It would be a legal nightmare.
I'll add some.
"International Traffic in Arms Regulations" is one way the US regulates technology leaving the country.
All companies and the govt itself must follow them, and the State Department must approve of it.
I submitted countless papers for approval to make sure my Mars documents couldn't teach people how to make a nuke.
Eventually they moved it out of ITAR.
If Starlink is a new way to guide a missile then that's a huge deal.
