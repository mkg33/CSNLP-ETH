Many of the complaints raised just make sense in these cases; trials held in closed courtrooms, no right to confront the accuser --when the details of a case involve treatment/behavior of minor, or when allegations of abuse are raised by a spouse/child/sibling, this might be warranted.
That isn't to say there shouldn't be more oversight, and a little more balancing the rights of the parents in these cases, for instance, perhaps the searches should be following the same warrant process used in criminal investigations, requiring a judge to sign off based on presented evidence.
