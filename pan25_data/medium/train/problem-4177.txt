While we have no short of idiots around here, as with any country.
Our formal education system is not supplying books about the importance of murdering Muslims.
I can assure you that.
Hmmm, I'm not sure about that, but I am sure that it's very hypocritical to have double standards.
There is no shortage of videos of isrelis making it clear they want genocide for Palestine, and it's not just a couple of random people, it's literally massive crowds.
Well you can be unsure about facts all you want, but as a graduate of Israeli education I can assure you there was absolutely nothing of that sort.
On the contrary, we had programs where we were learning about Palestinian struggles and there was even attempts at creating dialogs between Israeli Jews and Israeli Palestinians, etc.
But that could just be my school.
It’s a private school and from looking into this it seems the school has been deemed “inadequate” for quite a few years now.
Don’t actually know if they can close it down since it isn’t government funded.
It's hate speech though.
That shit doesn't fly over here.
If that video gets linked back to the school and it's all proven, it won't be allowed to carry on teaching - or at the very least there will some sackings and the ones responsible will be removed.
The fact that after decades of senseless violence many Israelis lost all hope for peace is not the same as systemic education coming from our schools, teaching us that giving up our lives to kill a few children is the right thing to do.
I mean the inspectors have said the school doesn’t meet the standards of an independent school for like 4 years running now and it’s still there .
Edit: Also, I might be missing something here but how is this different from all the other Apocalypse none sense in other religions?
