What's going on now is that the country is recovering.
The only thing that "got worse" in Biden's first two years was inflation (because jobs were steadily recovered and now are at a higher level than before the pandemic), and that happened because of Trump's tax cuts and PPP handouts raising the national debt so much more that they had to resort to printin more money to be able to honor the debts.
Since the economy was going through a period of contraction before, inflation didn't hit until it started expanding again, which is a very well known phenomenon in economics when you print money during a recession.
In the particular case of gas, there was price gouging going on by companies and OPEC, and even then the gas prices were lower than in the entirety of the developed world.
