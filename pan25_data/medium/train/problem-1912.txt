The Canadian constitution, most of it is unwritten convention.
Conventions form when practices are carried out without opposition for long periods.
That’s it.
This can easily become a convention that can spread to the rest of the provinces and even Parliament.
And then suddenly, 50 years from now, we go, oh yeah the constitution says that but we really don’t do it.
Just like the King and GG have zero power, when in reality, the Canadian constitution gives them considerable power….
Canada is acting like a teenager, and trying to rebel against its parents while not actually wanting to be independent.
If you don’t want the monarchy, then leave.
Australia has voted twice on the topic of becoming a republic but the vote lost twice, the boomers want to stay as part of the monarchy.
This sounds like you don’t understand how the amendment formula for the Canadian constitution works at all, and also what reopening up the constitution would main for aboriginal rights.
It is literally more complicated than holding a referendum lol.
