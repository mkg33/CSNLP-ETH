Right, and every time the idea of a change to that age comes up, people whine about "raising the retirement age" but the fact is, there IS no "retirement age.
".
I’ll never make it to retirement age.
I don’t know how the fuck they expect you to live on 1k a month anyway.
Not one company has a decent pension plan anymore and 401k plans are worthless, every 5 years Wall Street steals half your money.
I figure I’m going to die at work.
I'm probably going to be at least semi-retired by age 55, but that's because I've lived below my means, didn't father any children, and invested wisely over the past couple of decades and will be able to afford it.
At some point, the government will start paying me something, but until then it's up to me.
People are living longer and longer, so this arbitrary "retirement age" of 65 (brought in during a time when life expectancies were in the mid-70s) is going to need review.
We can't afford to carry people 20 or 30 years after they stop working and contributing.
