"In addition to his lack of impulse control, Donald has long exhibited a childâ€™s inability to accept responsibility.
This trait is familiar to those have seen Trump in action over the years.
".
What always strikes me about that quote is that he's bragging.
It's not that he's admitting to being developmentally stuck, it's pointing out that while some of us poor schmucks take entire lifetimes to learn and grow and change in search of a better version of ourselves, he was able to achieve his current pinnacle of perfection at just the age of six.
I find this quote pretty stunning, because the psychological analysis of narcissistic perverts is exactly this: their development stops at early childhood.
They cannot cope with any form of criticism.
They will deflect, blame others or lash out.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
That he somehow had one day the self awareness to realize he is stuck at 6 is remarkable (although he only says he has similar traits).
Too bad it happened once in his lifetime.
