Gee, I wonder why he would feel the need to use a private email and a pseudonym to do something that republicans insist is totally fine and above board?
Maybe because of Florida's very strong sunshine law, which makes it very easy for the public to force disclosure of state government records?
Oh, did he violate that law by using a private account for government business (x1), to conceal wrongdoing by state officials (x2), and lying about it (x3)??
?
I think he did!
But I doubt anything will happen to him, because the AG works for DeSantis too.....grrrr.
This reminds me of one of the areas where I will argue heavily against the "both parties are the same" people.
There are many issues that exist across the aisle, but at the end of the day, we cannot expect Republicans to root out, call out, or even pretend to care about corruption in their own party.
Here in NYS, our governor was forced to resign after his own AG investigated him and found he had a long history of sexual harassment.
The Democrats had a supermajority in the legislature and made it clear they would impeach and remove him if he didn't resign.
Meanwhile we have people like the above in DeSantis' admin, the Texas AG is putting off charges for his own crime.
The (South Dakota I think) AG is doing the same.
It's wild how they do this openly and completely lack accountability.
