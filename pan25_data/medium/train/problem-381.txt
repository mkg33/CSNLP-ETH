I only just watched a video on this so hope you don't mind if I just give you a link to watch it yourself.
I'm sure I'm remembering this half correctly at best and would appreciate clarifications and corrections.
Please correct me if I'm wrong but I seem to remember that when Argentina's currency devalued by a considerable degree, the Argentinian government asked foreign governments to do something like that (can't remember the specifics of exactly what and how) to their citizens's foreign holdings overseas somehow.
Also remember something about freezing funds people had including not considering one person's need urgent need for a kidney transplant as a reason to release funds and then they died.
Having said that, I would say JPow’s biggest mistake was sticking to the whole “inflation is temporary” theme until too late.
I don’t think he had much of a choice flooding the markets with cash during COVID, but he then refused to acknowledge the creeping inflation.
The whole 51% inflation 12 months ago is really bad.
Even when the economy was “OK” everywhere else, inflation was out of whack.
It’s poor foundation for whatever the next crisis might be (thanks for that Putin…).
Thanks for posting it.
Very interesting and sad at the same time.
It somehow reminds me to Greece’s woes 10 years ago (debt they could not repay etc).
When you see the debt most countries have (including the US and all European counties), it’s just surprising this does not happen more often.
The US debt has ballooning since ever and it is clear it will never be repaid.
