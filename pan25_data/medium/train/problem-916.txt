The Baltic States (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia) suffered greatly at the hands of the USSR.
Hundreds of thousands of their people were "relocated" (taken to gulags and killed) by the USSR.
Also the Soviets bought their own ethnic russians to replace those deported, and to this day these countries have a seizable russian population, some speak only russian, are loyal to russia, the older ones are getting their pensions from Russia, do not wish to assimilate into the general population in any way.
This is a standard russian tactic, it happened to them, to other former Soviet Republics and is happening now in Ukraine.
But they remember, they know how horrible russian rule is and now is in their power to fight against such horrors and that is what they are doing.
The Baltics, Poland, Finland, and other East European states will ALWAYS help Ukraine.
My grandfather got some years in prison (thankfully not exile to Siberia, but still) for singing a lithuanian folk/patriotic song.
Soviets were extremely offended apparently.
