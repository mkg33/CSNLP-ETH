It’s a difficult problem for sure.
No one wants crackheads on their street but we also can’t be nazis and disappear the undesirables.
I think taking them to a town away from the city where they have all the resources to get themselves better and also one of those suicide pods they have in Sweden.
So if they want to end the suffering they can just end it.
Some homeless people are beyond help.
They’ve fucked up their brains too much.
I don’t think the homeless should be all over the streets like in LA it’s dangerous.
People who live in a society deserve to not have crazy people taking over the streets.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
