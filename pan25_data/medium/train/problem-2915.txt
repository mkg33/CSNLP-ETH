I mean, I don't understand how he can say this and be truthful given what China thinks about that situation, and what Biden's said about defending Taiwan.
Seems there's going to be/is/has been a conflict no matter what.
To put it another way.
Let's say you warn people you will defend your friend if they attack.
That is not you seeking a conflict, that is you setting a clear understanding you will defend your buddy..
If people then attack your friend and you get involved, it was them seeking a conflict and you reacting defensively.
You know, America use to have a military presence in a country bordering China that we could have used to set up a base.
But guess what president blew that one...
You don't think that if the US decided to get even more involved in Ukraine that China wouldn't see that as an opportunity to invade Taiwan?
I'm definitely not a fan of Biden, but I think sending them a means to defend themselves was an overall better idea.
With or without Biden, we will eventually go to war with China and Putin would have eventually invaded Ukraine.
The fact that there was a looming threat by China definitely played a part in Putins decision as well.
When I was younger I'd completed the ASBAV and had everything in place to join the army and volunteer for Afghanistan.
Then the war in Iraq started and I refused to take part in that fool's endeavor, so I didn't take the oath and ship out.
