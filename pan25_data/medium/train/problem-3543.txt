Why would u do that if she was just dischRand trespassed??
Again why would cops know more about medical status then a doctor?
Again this is without hindsight when ppl get trespassed from hospital daily.
Honestly how are the cops guilty at all here?
They removed someone from trespassing and was discharged from a hospital.
How are they suppose to know what doctors dont.
Watch the footage.
They accused her of acting and actively delayed care that could have saved her.
They were also extraordinarily crass towards her, and seemed aware something wasn't right.
At least a couple referred to not wanting to take responsibility if she died.
The fact is, the last things she ever heard were these jokes and accusing her of faking.
The police were actually in a position they could have taken her back and forced the hospital to look at her.
Very likely she would have at least gotten another exam if they took her back sooner.
Well yea she just got discharged from the hospital a d the doctors cleared here and called the cops.
Fakers definitely exist and the doctors already checked her out.
What would you think in that situation.
