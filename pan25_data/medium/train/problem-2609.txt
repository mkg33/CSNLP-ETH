Now consider that Putin might actually be weighing that as a real possibility, and you'll see how thoroughly detached the Russians are from reality.
Like MAGA times twenty.
Imagine complaining that a country doesn't want peace with you while you're actively bombing their women and children.
Why the fuck would Ukraine want peace?
Everyone: ‘so you’re going to pull all your troops out of Ukraine, help rebuild, return all the children you stole, and pay quite a bit of reparations?’.
I don't entirely understand why everyone expects an unconditional surrender to be the only way to end this war.
Because Russia is unconditionally losing and have committed thousands of war crimes in plain view, and the entire international community apart from Iran and NK can choose to continue to embargo Russian goods and services pretty much forever if they don’t.
Imagine a world where Russia pulls back to their actual borders, and stops fighting, and the war ends and there's peace.
No restitution, no reparations, no sanctions, no admission of wrongdoing, no disarming or demilitarization.
Just "okay we're done murdering all your people now, let's have peace."
How asinine is that?
