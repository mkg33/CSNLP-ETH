Oh you want a see an embarrassed man go watch the Whitehouse correspondence dinner before trump won.
Seth Meyers hits him with some not exactly nice but certainly not HBO roasts level digs at trump and that man is not having a good time.the camera is just about parallel with him far on trumps right sorta zoomed in and trump is just staring at Seth, slouching with this look that's part "is this really happening" and "when I become leader of the free world ill put you to death and if I cant do it in my first term ill over throw the government, Seth."
I think Seth has said he genuinely feels a small amount of responsibility for trump taking the race more seriously because of embarrassing him in front of some of the most powerful people in the US.
Trump left the dinner soon after and literally never talked about it again.
