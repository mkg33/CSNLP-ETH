Using swarms of fast kamikaze drones or suicide bomber driven fast boats was one of the only ways the IS navy lost in simulated war games.
That and using communications that can't be hacked or cracked, like couriers.
Somethings are going to get more high tech than we can imagine, like AI controlled attack swarms, and counter swarm tech, but some will revert to older tech stuff that can't be stifled by high level state actors, more spread out and decentralized.
