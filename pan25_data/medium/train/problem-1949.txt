What I'd really watch for is if we give them .
From what I've heard the missile itself is ready, the problem is integration with the F-35.
(probably the Americans dragging their feet).
I don't think it's the Americans dragging their feet so much as the fact that Lockheed has their own competing missile and said "integrate the Spear 3 yourself or get us a government contract for the work"...
SDB is inferior to Spear 3, much shorter range since it's a glide bomb.
The UK prioritises its own missile industry as a matter of priority, it's one of the things the UK does extremely well.
Lockheed can only fuck around so much.
Trouble is Chernobyl.
Ukraine won't want to risk dropping missiles on the land around it for fear if disturbing the radioactive ground.
But anything outside of the exclusion zone is going to have a very bad day.
And anything inside the zone is going to be mildly irradiated.
Unless they dig trenches again in which case they'll be extremely irradiated.
I'm hoping enough reinforcing equipment gets there that when Russia launches its next offensive that it doesn't get a dozen miles into Ukraine before a wave of missiles just wipes out every vehicle in the Russian convoy, from fuel trucks to tanks to mobile artillery.
Russia leaving miles-long ant trails of burning vehicles.
No matter which direction they come from.
Just endless miles of death for the invaders.
