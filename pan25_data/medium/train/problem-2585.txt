Red wave happens, Trump is elected Speaker of the House by the GOP controlled congress, Biden and Harris get impeached, Trump becomes president again.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
The issue then is that some of the GOP folks might not vote for him as hes too controlled by the crazies.
We might not have a new speaker of the house today.
It would be nice if someone did something daring and just ran for it, without being concerned about the party.
There's no rule saying the Speaker has to be of the majority party.

Pretty sure no dems will vote for him, and too many R seem to be against him.
I dont think this is going well for him.
That being said, I dont see them voting for anyone else.
