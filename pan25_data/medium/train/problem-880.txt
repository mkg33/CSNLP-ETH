It’s a natural concern for Taiwan, but at the same time, semiconductors are so vital to our daily lives, not to mention country’s militaries, that it only makes sense for governments to pour increasing amounts of money and political muscle into getting as many semiconductors and as high a grade of them as possible built domestically.
Even though Taiwan's concerns seems to be valid we need to think about our own industry/defense/house holdnproducts/medical eq etc etc (chips are everywhere nowadays) so we need to have own capability to manufacture those chips domestically.
If a much more seasoned military machine lost to the US's hand-me-downs a less seasoned military machine is going to get their asses absolutely routed by US boots on the ground with their best weapons.
Thr US's hand-me-down weapons tore Russia a new one.
The US said they would directly be involved in a conflict between China and Taiwan.
China has no experience in fighting since the Sino-Vietnamese War in the late 70's.
Being more aggressive now is useless when none of their doctrines have been put into action in the last 40 years, other than fighting Indians with sticks and rocks at the borders.
