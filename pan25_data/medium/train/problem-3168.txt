My tinfoil hat theory about Sinema is that she was a Republican plant placed in the Democratic primaries tailor-made to lose the general elections by being too far "left" and "one of those people."
Only, she failed by actually getting elected and has since made up for it by being a constant roadblock to Democrats.
I fully expect her to lose her primary, attempt one last sabotage/fuck you by running as an Independent, and then spend the rest of her days running the conservative media circuit anytime they need a "former liberal" to shit talk Democrats, aka, the Tulsi Gabbard/Dave Rubin route.
I don't disagree, I just fully expect her to be delusional enough to try, and you just know she's going to get some of that sweet Republican dark money from GOP megadonors.
It’s crazy to me how much Reddit hates Manchin compared to Sinema.
Manchin is from WV… the fact he is a Democrat at all is amazing.
He is fairly upfront and predictable as a Republican lite.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Sinema is full on corrupted by the highest bidder.
If she was primaried out it is realistic that an actual “regular” Democrat could win.
