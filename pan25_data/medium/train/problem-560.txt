I don't even know if he believes what he's saying, but I know that there is at least a small subset of MAGAdittoheads who have been malinformed by at least a quarter century of shock jock opinion programming and reality TV entertainment passing for "politics" using their call and response "talking points" to shape public opinion and shift the Overton window so that complete idiots feel as though they are better informed about politics than everybody else.
Once they have convinced the "malinformed" that they are "more informed", that's where it starts to get dangerous.
These people feel frustrated that either nobody will engage them on their baffling bullshit or that the responses are not what they want, leading them to have further internalized resentment and persecution complexes against their political opponents.
Some have recently begun referring to these forms of logical and rhetorical fallacies being used as bludgeoning psyops to incite Division and create a permission structure for violence as stochastic terrorism.
