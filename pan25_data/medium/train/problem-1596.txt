The defense spending is largely due to the dozens and dozens of bases we have around the globe as a defense system.
It's basically the same as the Ukraine aid, just with American soil and boots around the globe.
The 50k we have stationed in Japan comes out of that budget, along with equipment for them.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
I don't call it over bloated.
The defense spending is why Ukraine is free right now.
Without the US war machine, millions of Ukrainians would be getting raped and tortured for sport.
we've sent them 27 billion in aide.
the fiscal year 2022 military budget was 750 billion.
that's just one year.
This is what republicans see as a win.
Cutting the much more important non-defense spending, while increasing the already insanely over bloated defense spending.
At this point I think their goal is explicitly for America to fail as a nation.
so, yes, the US support of the ukraine military is a big part of their success.
however, we did not, nor do we, need to spend 750 billion+ per year in order to be able to provide that aide.
