The main thing I can think of is that these systems, along with being incredibly complex and requiring multiple vehicles to fully set up, are fairly advanced as well.
If even one somehow managed to fall into Russian hands they may be able to advance their designs by decades just from some reverse engineering of our systems.
It'll also give them an idea of countermeasures and I'm sure china would pay a pretty ruble for that information as well.
This system will most likely be deployed around Kyiv to help defend the main city.
Patriot can do it and Ukraine is getting ONE for the whole country after a year of asking for it.
It's great it is finally happening but I don't understand the reason for such a delay and providing only one system.
Ukrainians could definitely be trained to use it, that can't be an excuse.
They were given one battery, not one single launcher.
That's a fire control vehicle, a radar array, a power plant, six launchers, a reloading vehicle, and training for the four platoons required to operate and maintain it.
