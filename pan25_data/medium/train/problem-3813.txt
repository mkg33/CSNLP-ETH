Thank you.
It's why it's frustrating to see some Americans speak against the help for Ukraine.
This is finally a clear cut good vs evil situation.
We have to abilitiy to help Ukraine more then anyone and change the course of the war.
We can show the world what America can do for good.
Yet they still don't get it, but luckily they are not in power.
They are the same type of people who in 1940 would be screaming out against lend lease to UK.
Im sure they would have been talking about how unfair the Versailles treaty was to Germany, and its not Germanys fault they attacked Poland and need.
I just assumed the US and other NATO countries were pretty much giving them a live feed from their satellites.
Seems like a 'least they could do' thing.
Yes but Russia is always playing victim.
In their minds and foreign supporters Russia is not to blame for anything in Ukraine.
It's the "NATO Expansion" that is at fault.
You know Russia apparently has no agency at all, its NATO fault that Russia had to attack the power grid with cruise missiles.
It's some sick twisted stuff.
It reminds me of a domestic abuse situation where the husband is screaming at the recently punched wife look what you made me do!
