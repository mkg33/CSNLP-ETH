Ukraine needs to push Russia back to the internationally recognized borders, blow up any Russian military targets within HIMARS range and set up proper defenses in the event they try to come back over the border.
Then there might be a chance of peace talks.
Crimea is easier to liberate than Donbas for that reason.
Russia can supply Donbas easily.
And they know it: they're already beefing up defenses in Crimea.
It's the opposite: Crimea is very hard to defend.
It's been taken by the Germans in WW2 very easily.
Yes this is true, from what I understand as well.
If Ukraine can cut off the land bridge that Putin has so far held onto, the only way to resupply Crimea is over Kerch Straight Bridge, which has already been bombed once...or by ferry, which from a logistics standpoint, cannot replace a bridge or land crossing.
Also, the main water supply to all of Crimea can be dammed as well (Ukraine already did this before when Putin annexed Crimea) effectively cutting off Crimea from all food, water, and weapons resupply.
It would essentially become an island with no food, water, weapons, or any kind of resupply.
Not an ideal position to be defending from.
