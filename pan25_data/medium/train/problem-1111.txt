Both young "activists" and the old and wealthy are both massive hypocrites that tell us by their actions that they don't believe in the tripe they are spouting or they think they get a double standard.
Either way they don't deserve to be listened to or taken seriously.
Or better yet don't listen to protestors.
Listen to the \95% of scientists that agreed that climate change is an existential threat.
Worst case scenario they are wrong and we build a better, cleaner world for no reason.
Yes because a paper that doesn't take a position can't be counted one way or the other?
Especially when you consider there will be tons of papers published on the impact of climate change that have nothing to do with the cause.
A paper that sets out to investigate the impact of climate change on coral reefs that doesn't say one way or the other whether climate change is man made not being counted is not the big gotcha you think it is.
And its not exactly "whistle blowers" when the methodology is set out in the original study.
