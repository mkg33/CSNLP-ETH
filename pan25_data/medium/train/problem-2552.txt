Yeah, because a trial would require charges, the state and the fed know that there's no charges, and sane people don't just burn money into the court system to prop up bogus charges.
Well she is right in the sense that we should care about that officer.
Lt. Michael Byrd barricaded the doors from the mob that Babbitt was a part of.
There was no place to retreat.
If the mob got through those doors, they would’ve had access to members of Congress.
Byrd should get a Congressional Medal of Honor for his sacrifice and Babbitt’s body should be dumped in the middle of the ocean just as we do to other terrorists.
Likely only because they don't want to set a precedent that climbing through the broken glass of a locked door to the floor of Congress while government agents tell you to stop with weapons drawn is acceptable.
