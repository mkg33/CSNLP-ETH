We didn't send the IFV/APC versions of those vehicles, hence the wording in my comment.
It's suboptimal that the Army will have to wait longer for their equipment, but really, they are not even the second line of defense when it comes to protecting Canadian soil.
The RCN and the RCAF are the ones patrolling our border, so it makes sense to divert equipment from the Army.
If anything, this is actually the most optimal way to use Army equipment: send it to Ukraine to fight the only arctic power that can threaten us.
It’s either that or ukraine is severely running out of ammo for their Soviet equipment (or spare parts) and they need to quickly change to nato stuff that the Allies can help with support and ammo.
But I agree there’s a big shift and I believe it’s not because of the Russian attacks on civilians made the allies do this.
Those have been going on from the beginning of the war and only now we see these big changes.
Could also be for a spring counter attack where Ukraine was able to show a good plan to win this war.
