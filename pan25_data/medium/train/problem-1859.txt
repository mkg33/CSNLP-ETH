Article III.
Section 2 of the Constitution gives SCOTUS powers "under such Regulations as the Congress shall make."
Doesn't this mean Congress has the power to compel SCOTUS to follow an ethics regime?
Personally, I thing the DOJ should just get rid of their ability to create precedence, as well as their judicial immunity (just for the SC though) on the grounds that both themselves are matters of precedence, and 'if congress wanted it to be that way, they should have put it into a law'.
