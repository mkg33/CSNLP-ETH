Even before Modi, there has always been a hatred or distrust of BBC among many people.
It's considered to be smug and supremacist by quite a lot of people.
Some also hold BBC responsible for ousting of Mossadeq in Iran that led to the shit show that it is now.
RW are even calling for a ban on BBC in India, pointing out that the US and Europe have banned Russian RT and had banned Chinese CGTN briefly.
Not saying you're wrong but I found almost all of the comments to be shitting on TMC MP and BBC.
I must have missed, but I could find only one comment related to what you're saying.
So why are you even here, in this conversation?
Did you think the comment you were responding to was going to lead you to a bunch of nice people complimenting each other and being nice?
I had already looked at the comment section.
Scrolled over it.
Eyeballed around 20 comments.
I found one comment thread (at that time) criticizing Islam (which the comment I was replying to mentioned).
I found most of the other ones to be criticizing TMC MP or BBC.
The commenter told me to check out more of the comments on Islam, to which I said, I didn't want to go through 100s of comments there.
As if that's the only work I have left.
