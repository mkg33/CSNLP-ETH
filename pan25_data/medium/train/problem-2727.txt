As someone who works in tech and has dated multiple engineers, some of whom fell into this trump/qanon nonsense no less, and has worked with engineers of a similar variety, it could probably be a case study on how susceptible to becoming radicalized (on both sides of the political spectrum) people can become if they fall into some of these fields.
Truthfully I think part of it is a certain kind of arrogance that these fields can breed especially if you're seen as "successful" by societal standards.
Pretty sure there was a study involving high end academics being tested to see if they were more or less susceptible to a con man vs a more average person and it turning out they were.
With people like that it isn't about intelligence or even good information, it's about winning at any cost, they hate the young, they hate the poor, they hate immigrants, and they especially hate anyone liberal or leftist.
They hate these groups so much they don't care who their "hero" is, they don't care if he's a rapist or tyrant, they just want to win in order to destroy what they hate.
