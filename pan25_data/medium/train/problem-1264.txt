I agree with your last sentence but read the comments under any post about this.
People just don't give a shit unfortunately.
They're unwilling to learn the nuances of the conflict and are quick to just dismiss it as an unfixable all sides are bad conflict when that's far from the truth.
This should be an easy conflict to support.
The Junta is unequivocally the bad guy, but no one cares and more importantly no one wants to care.
Edit: people assume that there's like 30 different sides in this war because that's kind of how it was in the past.
No one is paying attention to the developments like that almost every ethnic minority in Burma is uniting against the junta along with the PDF's who represent the outlawed democratic faction of the Burmese government.
Or that the Junta is financially, politically, and militarily supported by Russia and china.
It should be a no brainer.
Yeah, I agree.
And especially since this happened around the same time as January 6thâ€¦ like, America could have been in a similar situation if their coup had succeeded.
So I view it as connected (via Russian influence).
