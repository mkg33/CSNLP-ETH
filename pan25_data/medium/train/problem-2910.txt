I sure hope the media have learned from 2016 and will deprive Trump from billions of dollars of free publicity.
Sadly, there's an army of useful idiots who keep retweeting his every intestinal expression.

Nazis do not go away just because you ignore them.
We literally tried that already and it failed miserably, not just in the 1920s and the 1930s, but literally 6 fucking years ago.
OTOH, without Trump, cable news ratings fell off drastically.
From a purely financial point of view, he would do wonders for them if he ran again, became President, started tweeting etc.

If you want to deprive Trump of oxygen, stop watching cable news.
