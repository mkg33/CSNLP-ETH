What I find interesting about this is that I think a lot of people (including me) thought she understood she was a one and done senator and that the goal was for a cushy media gig, not to stay in office.
2024 for that seat has two options: a different dem or a republican.
She can kick and scream about it, but if she is truly an unpopular democrat, nothing will make people show up for her.
And she isn't getting republican votes.
Republicans vote for republicans.
See Charlie Crist.
Seems like political survival is the goal which kind of surprises me.
I had assumed a talking head gig on Fox was the plan prior to this move.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
She wants to keep the senate gig and doing that as a Democrat guarantees a primary challenge she might not win.
As an independent she acts to split the vote and hand the seat to a Republican.
She’s betting the Democrats will make the calculation that it’s cheaper to keep her…and as much as I hate to say it, she’s probably right.
So either she is trying to figure out a way to bully her way into another term, or she's just trying to burn it down on her way out.
But if she believes she'll actually win another term, then she is delusion; either on her own or by someone else.
