let's face it, everything important is opsec and reddit is the last place you'll find up to date info, theres a lot of headlines that are time delayed both intentionally and due to the chain of communication, at the end of the day USA is helping a country being genocided and I am thankful for the Americans support, and in this case I am also thankful for their military budget.
