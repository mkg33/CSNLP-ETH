Think again.
Views equals more ad revenue.
And for the most part, these people don't care about propaganda.
They just care about getting you to tune in.
You won't see someone or something on the news that is sensible because it doesn't make you feel enough.
Tuning in to watch the crazies, that gets us riled up.
Whether you support the views they sensationalize, or you tune in just to tear them apart.
The market to everyone.
Fox new knows a certain percent of their viewers are there just to watch the shitshow, and they have people watching those numbers to maximize the feeeeelings.
Sadly, many people are largely helpless to the call of their feelings.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
