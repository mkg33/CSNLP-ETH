I’m somehow managing to control them here by constantly keeping poison out for them, but I’ll see the occasional bug which stresses me the fuck out because I know they’re infested which means it would be easy for me to be infested.
I clean like 5 times a day to make sure they don’t have any reason to stick around.
So far it’s working.

Bro I live in a trailer.
It ain’t too bad.
Mines old and falling apart, so we’re gonna upgrade soon.

Oh I'm not knocking it, my parents bought a trailer for cash because of the deal they got.
It literally just looks like a long house.
You can only tell it's a trailer because of how the sunken living room is.
It's quite nice, and part of where I got the idea.
