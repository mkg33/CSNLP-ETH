Straight up told my gf I'm not doing these extra holidays anymore, in terms of gifts.
We'll still go out and have a specific date night, but the gifts are getting to be too much.
She still bought me $15 worth of cheap and unneeded male grooming shit and complained I didn't get her anything... of course she didn't blink when I reminded her our fancy dinner cost $300....
I'm certainly a gift giver, but I prefer to get gifts for people that aren't attached to a holiday.
Just a random present because I saw something that made me think of them, and I wanted to get it for them.
Its generally something pretty cheap, if im gonna spend a bunch of money on someone i make sure its something they want and will use, like some skull and cross bones ice trays i bought for a friend who loves skulls.
I actually don't exchange gifts with my husband or family on actual holidays because that feels weird and forced.
I also vastly prefer what I call personal holidays (birthdays, anniversaries etc) to set calendar holidays.
