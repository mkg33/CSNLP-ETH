Yes they did, and good on them for doing it.
I wish they had been able to go further and get single payer universal healthcare, but they barely had enough votes for what they got.
And that’s kind of my point.
If they would stop pushing away independent and left leaning gun owners by going HAM on gun control every election, they would probably have more seats with which to pass stronger universal healthcare, or bills to help with income inequality or reductions to the cost of education, or better social safety nets.
And let’s not forget, the ACA came during a time the Democratic Party was relatively quiet about their gun control goals.
It’s ramped up every year since then as Democrats lean further and further into gun control.
In general, be courteous to others.
