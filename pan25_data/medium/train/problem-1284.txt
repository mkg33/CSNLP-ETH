Like, there’s audio, of him threatening a state official to falsify election results.
It’s REALLY clear cut.
He doesn’t say it like “I think there is fraud so I want you to recount and that should tip the scales.” He literally says “find me exactly 11,780 votes, which is exactly how many I need to win.” 11,780, exactly.
Just say I got this many, and if you don’t then I will expose you.
