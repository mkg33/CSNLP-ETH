Even if one naively believes the Comey email investigation was innocent there is still his announcement that another investigation of Billâ€™s pardon of Marc Rich.
An announcement that had on ostensible urgency.
He's a total hypocrite who was just taking advantage of the situation to get what he wanted while trying to seem innocent in the whole thing.
The pardon had a bad odor no doubt about it.
That is a separate issue from an announcement of a reinvestigation into it immediately prior to the election.
