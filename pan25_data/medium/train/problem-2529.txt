This is a good diplomatic move by Ukraine, it's basically "hey we appreciate that you're helping us by providing us with drones so we want to help you in your time of need however we can".
Bro until the aftershocks and new magnitude 6+ stop popping up every hour, it's still ongoing as far as I'm concerned.
ruptures on one section of a fault zone can increase stress in another.
that's why of why aftershocks occur, and potentially even additional earthquakes that could be considered their own mainshocks.
It's a triple junction between the Anatolian, Arabian, and African tectonic plates.
Something really, REALLY big moved down there.
The map of the epicenters shows the plate boundaries:
I know Haiti had a really bad one in 2010, they're been a few causing tsunamis in the Indian ocean...
What you don't think forcing the hand of Erdogan to allow Sweden and Finland to join NATO won't save lives?
You don't think having a united front would affect how the war in Ukraine is currently going?
There are more ways than one to save lives, right now the international community is doing the right thing despite their differences and sending aid and support to Turkey.
I didn't say they're sending aid to force Erdogan's hand.
I said sending aid will force his hand because they're not as awful as he paints them to be.
Now I'm not sure how a natural disasters could help Erdogan, if these buildings are falling down due to poor regulations then it could actually make it look worse for him since his government has allowed this to happen.
Conversely you could look at it from another perspective, despite the whole NATO situation, Sweden and Finland would be sending humanitarian support to the people of Turkey.
That in of itself is a sign of good faith.
