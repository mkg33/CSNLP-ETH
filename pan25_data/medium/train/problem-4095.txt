There are more details coming about this story and it seems that "gift from Ukraine" part was made up to make it look even a little bit less moronic.
The police officer responsible for firing grenade launcher has been visiting Ukraine recently, but rumors some journalists are starting to quote is that he requested grenade launcher from Polish army (he has high ranking friends) as a toy to play with.
Which seems a lot more plausible than Ukrainians giving back weapons they received.
I also wonder how the fuck would Polish border control allow import any weapon, far more a grenade launcher, even if it's done by a policeman.
That's a breach of law.
And if he had it in his office officially, who the heck approved a police station having rocket launcher on the balance?
That said, that potato can pack some very serious energy.
Throw in a larger combustion chamber, maybe use acytelene as propellant, and it can punch through wooden doors, glass, thin metal sheets (like car fenders), etc.
This was also a V2 of the potato canon, with a detachable barrel to be carried in a backpack.
V1 was larger, and was... confiscated by Brooklyn cops when we took it outside.
They told us, it was technically a firearm, and I couldn't argue with that logic (even though really, one shouldn't argue with cops anyway, especially when they are just letting you go with no consequences).
