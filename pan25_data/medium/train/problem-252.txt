Good point.
But its on a level I'm okay with accepting at face value.
It doesn't have the same "look how strong russia is!"
Idea they like to parade around and instead is about a person who had to make a very hard choice, like a captain going down with the ship (not the bret analogy).
Its showcasing one thing I think we can all agree russians have in spades: cold hard decision making.
We may not agree with those decisions all of the time (most) but I feel pretty safe saying they will make those choices harder and more stoic than just about anyone else.
I reckon the biggest blow for Russia is Alla Pugacheva, which is the biggest and the most known superstar singer from soviet era till nowadays.
She is sort of a mother figure of soviet culture and beyond, everyone knows her songs.
And so she, and her husband Maxim Galkin, who is also a huge media figure, both have spoken against war since the beginning.
And suddenly, both are cancelled and the legacy gets switched to "well they weren't so great at all".
It's such a shot in the leg from kremlin, and shows perfectly why media figures should condemn this war, because exactly, unlike political figures, who may not interest everyone, the reach of celebrities is much more massive.
