China is desperately dependant on imports, straight up will starve immediately if they get cut off.
One of these days a missile is going to donk into Japan and Kim is probably going to look like someone waterboarded him with White out before the race to eliminate him kicks off.
NGL if I had missiles I'd fire them over trivial shit as well.
Didn't sleep past 6am - missiles.
Constipated, missiles ran out of missiles you guessed it!
MISSILES.
Brick, I've been meaning to talk to you about that.
You should find yourself a safehouse or a relative close by.
Lay low for a while, because you're probably wanted for murder.
Japan's navy controls the ocean.
They would starve out withing a few weeks.
No need for ground war.
I meant China would only last a few weeks, due to the fact they are so import reliant especially with food.
China's geography sucks and they have no control over their coastline, just like Russia.
It's why they're so testy about the South China sea and hates japan.
Japan has like the second or 3rd strongest navy.
Not to mentioned allied with the US, the strongest navy.
