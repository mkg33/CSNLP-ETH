For all the shit the rest of the country talks about our state, there are a lot of reasons so many of us love living here, and a sane government is definitely one of them.
I was talking more about how it will effect salaries rather than wages.
As in will the pay gap between men and women close due to the fact everyone will be able to see what everyone else is getting paid - rather than having to guess.
Will the average salary go down as companies will be afraid to bring in a rock star and pay them more but have to disclose that fact, or will they go up as new hires can see what everyone else is earning and demand similar salaries.
Or will it all balance out.
I think in minimum wage jobs everyone always knew what everyone else was earning so it will have zero impact, but now Jane in accounts knows Jim is earning 20% more than her can rightfully ask her boss why without coming across as somone who snooped Jim's payslip, or is carrying grudge.
