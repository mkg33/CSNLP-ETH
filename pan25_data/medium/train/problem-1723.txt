> European and G7 involvement in Russian oil declines as new trading patterns emerge in first month of price cap scheme.
Did you guys see the paywall prices on that site?
After a 4 week $4 trial it’s only a measly $126/mo or the “premium” digital access annually for $2199 a year!
What a steal.
They didn’t add, they replaced.
And you left out the “misleading“ part.
Compare the actual title with the title they used and tell me how it is more representative and not misleading, especially when the rest of the article isn’t available.
Wasn't it said before that in terms of insurance the value of of the cargo is limited to an upper amount based on the price cap on Russian oil to throttle Russia's ability to make a profit while at the same time not completely messing up the oil market by completely removing Russian oil altogether?
The ultimate goal was to basically give India and China dirt cheap oil which on the surface might seem odd but in reality it meant those 2 countries could demand severely discounted oil or Russia get's no money at all.
In addition if China and India are fleecing Russia for oil their demand for the more expensive oil used by Europe is reduced keeping European Oil prices stable.
