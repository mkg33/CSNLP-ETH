You are so butthurt.
Like you couldn’t be any more clearly upset that someone would dare criticize your leader.
So sensitive.
Acting like he’s a precious being, fuck him.
All i want to ask is where was this criticism when Congress was in power?
Why did USA and European countries supported Pakistan in indo pak war?
Or when tibet was taken from us or the recent oil transportation from Russia to Europe in between war?
I'm not upset I'm just trying to clarify what i see now a days with all the criticism, where was this criticism under Congress rule?
Or when Europe took oil from Russia in huge amount and stacked or when the was in middle East, Modi is not my ideal and I'm just trying to have an opinion from other people perspective and stuff idk how to explain that.
Meanwhile BBC making documentaries that have absolutely no basis when Modi got a trials under different govt rule 2 times and after they create fake documentaries on him and try to hurt global image i wonder what's wrong with that.
Why don't BBC make colonial documentary?
Or how shit wa Elizabeth was ?
