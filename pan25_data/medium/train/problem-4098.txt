The United States is so anxious and paranoid about China.
The PRC is an imploding state that is laughably incapable of meaningfully extending its influence beyond its borders.
It really has no allies or friends, and its leadership is foolishly uninterested in building strong alliances.
They only want subjugation but are incapable of achieving that with other countries.
Russia was Venezuela's previous major ally, and was a source of both financial and military aid to them ever since things went south between them and the US.
Now that Russia has become unplugged from both the world economy and military exporting, this leaves Caracas trying to find a new partner.
Since the US is unwilling to let China become that partner, and thereby make inroads into the Americas, the US itself is going to prop them up.
And this is why all third party nations want multipolarity.
If not for the threat of china, venezuela would still be in the doghouse.
Every system needs checks and balances and monopolies are terrible.
