I don't think that the French soldiers recently in Mali were the inspiration.
I think the inspiration was the French soldiers in Algeria in the '50's and 60's.
In which case, the movie is kinder than they deserved.
I believe it is referring to the part in the movie where a mercenary group tries to raid a Wakandan outreach center, who are then caught and presented to the U.N.
Calling out the French representative in the process.
France has done plenty of shady stuff in Africa, and they shouldnâ€™t be talking, but can we talk about the xenophobic messagIng in Wakanda Forever (I just watched it for the first time)?
Like every time there was a scene suggesting the that American government might actually be evil, the next scene distracts the audience with an angry mesoamerican who framed as the real bad guy.
Also, Wakanda is repeatedly vindicated for their isolationism.
There was plenty I liked about the movie, but it felt like the whole thing was playing on xenophobic American prejudices.
I had completely even forgotten that aspect of the story; I remembered the sirens mind-controlling the exploration group to literally go jump in the ocean to their deaths.
Edit: Based on the scenes that don't really go anywhere, I think the CIA may have been a more central villain before Marvel finished cutting it.
Yes, the actual villain of the movie.
I am suggesting that the writers made a xenophobic narrative by framing the xenophobic isolationist nation against against scary Mexican invaders in order to play on xenophobic American prejudices.
