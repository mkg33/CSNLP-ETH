Exactly.
That is the thing about Autocracies.
You could let a little reform in and prevent some of these issues from spiralling out of control, but that would mean losing power.
So instead of reforming or trying to keep the status quo, you double down on repression and oppression.
You kidnap, kill, torture and rape people to try to keep them in line hoping fear will win in the end.
If that doesn't work you just keep doing it, until it works or you get a civil war.
All it takes is one random car bombing, assassination or internal coup attempt and all Hell will break loose.
Hell the Supreme Leader is 83 years old and has been in charge since 1989.
If he were to suddenly kick the bucket tomorrow from old age, what happens than.
Do they put in a guy just as cruel as him or do they pull a Secret Speech talking about how terrible he as and blame all the atrocities on him to cover their ass.
"This surely won't escalate things or piss people off more.
I mean what is martyrdom really and how could it hurt my regime."
- Leader of Iran, probably.
Whether it’s done through a kangaroo court or not, if you look over at /r/NewIran you will see the Iranian government is kidnapping, torturing, raping, and killing young Iranians everyday.
Edit: Update: I am not going to link it so as not to break any rules, but it appears the Iranians are doxing the government officials involved in this case.
>Mizan said Shekari had been arrested Sept. 25, then convicted Nov. 20 on the charge of “moharebeh,” a Farsi word meaning “waging war against God.” That charge has been levied against others in the decades since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and carries the death penalty.
