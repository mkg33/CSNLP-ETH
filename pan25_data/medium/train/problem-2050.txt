A bunch of the legislators who voted in favor of this bill voted AGAINST outlawing conversion therapy for minors back in 2020.
These legislators would be perfectly comfortable allowing literal, proven child abuse to continue to be sanctioned by the state - as long as it's being done in the name of Christianity.
Of course Republicans would vote against conversion therapy torture.
They want to go back to the electrocuting LGBTQIA+ people again.

Fun fact: the U.S. is the only nation that hasn't signed the UN's Declaration of the Rights for the Child, and not a single state has done anything to investigate corporal punishment abuse in Christian homeschooling, even though HSLDA has been found to have documented reports of abuse in homeschooling and even wrote a pamphlet of how to get away with it.
