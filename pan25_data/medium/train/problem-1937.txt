I’m not assuming ill intent for that reason.
A lot of people who may be well intentioned will still say “the Ukraine” even though, unknown to them, that language serves a political purpose to diminish Ukrainian sovereignty and state hood.
It may seem like I’m nitpicking but Russia has been trying to diminish Ukrainian language, culture and national aspirations since the time of Catherine the Great.
I personally use to say “the Ukraine” and often used the Russian spelling and prunciation for Ukrainian cities.
Since 2013 I’ve made a conscious effort to call Ukraine by the official name of the country and to use the Ukrainian spellings and pronunciations as well in order to reflect the sovereignty and the national agency of Ukrainians.
Well done, PM Fiala… this is the way it’s done when you want to apply pressure on Russia to stop its war against the Ukraine.
You cut off the money supply, and that with sanctions will force Putin to the table and negotiate a peaceful resolution.
no world leader can advance against another nation without having adequate steady, money supply.
Just FYI the country is called “Ukraine” not “the Ukraine” in the official name of the country there is no “the” anywhere.
While I’m sure this was not your intent “the Ukraine” refers to more of a geographic area and not a country and it’s frequently used by Russian sympathizers in order to imply that Ukraine is not a real sovereign country.
