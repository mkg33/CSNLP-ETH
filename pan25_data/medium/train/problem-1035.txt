But I agree, not trying to die on a hill I just was pointing that the reply that was made wasn't really addressing the comment about highest bidder for what they meant, at least from what I could tell.
Not a Russian shill but selling crops for profitâ‰ it going to where people are hungry necessarily, which is all they were pointing out.
Ukraine is great but, they were only saying hey let's not accidentally frame their grain production as a humanitarian effort of giving away crops to whoever is hungry, which is how the comment somewhat seemed to imply, and that they would be selling it, just like everyone else, to whoever gives them the best offer.
