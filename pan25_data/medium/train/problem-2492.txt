Different satellites, differents point of view and incidence angle.
For example, for Rubizhne (second image) Moshchun (fourth), you can see that the source of the older observation is Maxar, but it's Planet for the recent one.
and let's not kid ourselves, putin is our times hitler.
he won't just want ukraine...as many have already said.
The west made the mistake of empowering dictators and enemies just so corporations could make more profit.
The chickens have come home to roost and Putin is not the only turd that the world now has to deal with.
They are exactly the same locations.
It is just that the satellites couldn't take photographs from the exact same angles.
Like, you take a photograph today then try to take the exact same photograph tomorrow... it won't be exactly the same angle, right?
As for pictures from 2000BC, I am pretty sure there were no colored photographs and satellites back then, so you are out of luck.
I understand why you would rather want to put your head in the sand and pretend like they aren't the same place.
