This fucking worm stood by Trump through innumerable attacks on the Constitution, the rule of law, and basic human decency.
He still stands by him even after unleashing a violent mob on the Capitol that chanted “Hang Mike Pence”.
I think bootlicking really should’ve been the eighth sin.
We all know Trump did not use those words to chew Pence out for not treasoning hard enough.
Pence is STILL rimming the same boot that stepped on him.
