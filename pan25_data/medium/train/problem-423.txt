Absolute horseshit of a title and article (Newsweek, duh).
Bulgaria as a country may have been aligned with Russia in the past but the man in the picture (former PM of Bulgaria during beginning of the war, Kiril Petkov), is anything but aligned with Russia.
He’s educated in Harvard and lived for many years in the US before returning to Bulgaria and running on a pro-EU/West/NATO platform.
Of course he helped Ukraine, because he’s not aligned with Russia!
Shitty clickbait headline.. to my knowledge Bulgaria didn't swear allegiance to putin so you can't say they betrayed him.
All this is is Bulgaria sees the writing on the wall and they wanna make sure the world doesn't assume they're on Russia's side given that in the past they were more aligned with Russia (so was Ukraine at one point by the way lol).
Putin owns two or three of the major political parties in Bulgaria.
Everyone knows that.
They are on his payroll and do his bidding.
30+ years after the fall of Communism, Bulgaria can't get rid of its past association with Russia.
Despite being an EU country since 2007, it still enjoys the lowest quality of life, lowest GDP per capital, highest mortality and much more in Europe.
Despite billions of EU aid and loans, for all kinds of infra projects, the country still has only one major highway.
That's the reality folks.
Well, lowest GDP per capita in the EU, not Europe.
Moldova, Belarus, and Ukraine exist.
Maybe others too?
man the whole post-soviet sphere is just so fucked.
Robbed blind by the Russians and still decades after being free from them still pretty fucked.
