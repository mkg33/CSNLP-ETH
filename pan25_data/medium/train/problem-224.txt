I believe in Mary Trump’s book, she recalls a gift from Donald that was a gift basket with the good stuff evidently taken out of it…like (as an example, not what was in the book) the basket was called “Chocolate, Wine, and Nuts” and there was a package of cashews in the basket.
I mean, I suppose that's possible, but I was going to say that as well and then I found I couldn't imagine him ever giving anything away as a gift regardless of how little he valued it.
It’s funny because he probably thinks they belong to him.
If they really were given to him personally, it’s an illegal gift.
If they don’t belong to him (they belong to the US govt), then he stole them.
