Le fait que je dise que la police est presque toujours plus proche du compte réel que les syndicats, ca montre qu'évidemment je ne soutiens pas les manifestations ?
“More than a million people have joined a day of protests and strikes, according to France's interior ministry, against plans to push back the age of retirement from 62 to 64.”.
You're telling me you're able to count millions of people in the street by yourself?
And you're able to do that in all the cities that had protest at the same time ?
That's the stupidest shit i've read all day.
i also love the way they try to get us to wait longer to utilize it.
Hey wait a few more years, and you can get more.
If one day you stop overestimating your own capabilities, or/and stop being biased as fuck.
You can actually read about the subject.
Like I said, every time a third entity also counted the number of people in protests, they have always been closer to the number of the police than the one from the unions, who is often 3/4 times the real number.
