The boss gave shit work to a subcontractor who was hired with weird contract clauses.
In retaliation, he got the boss to fail to identify an airplane, triggering the "extra pay when asked to work when a UFO is sighted near the building" clause.
Sounds like it was a balloon of some sort based upon the "like the other one" comment and the fact that there aren't many things that fly at 40,000 ft (12000 m) that aren't maneuverable.
At the end of the day UFO weirdos being weird doesn't harm anyone but themselves.
A congressman refusing to invest in defensive recon because he thinks it's a bunch of Woo Woo could lead to actual issues down the road.
You might think "just say it's not aliens.
Congress people aren't stupid" but we live in a world where congress people think the Jews have a secret space program.
I heard it was the opposite.
Every time they used the term UFO, even if it was technically a UFO, people who don't believe in aliens would assume they were talking about aliens and refused to take the issue seriously.
This is of course a problem when you're talking about potentially hostile aircraft from China / Russia / wherever entering our airspace but you don't know what the object is because radar can only detect that there is an object, not what it looks like.
It would be our luck that after decades of people going on about UFOs and aliens, the first actual alien ship gets shot down due to an ongoing pissing contest between different human factions.
