It's not.
Trust me, it's not.
The last time I got into a serious discussion of the engineering challenges of fusion reactors someone flat out didn't believe me because the fuel they run on is so insanely rare it literally cannot be found in nature (tritium).
Challenge two is the fusion temperature of 100,000,000 C, which is what we'd tend to call "pretty hot."
It kind of goes on from there...
Still, i maintain hope.
Fission is good, but safety and the waste product is not something we want to have to deal with in the long term.
Geothermic and hydro power are not available everywhere, wind and solar are not very reliable.
Fusion is currently the only clean energy which is not dependent on location or weather.
Maybe if we figure out how to create better batteries, solar and wind would become a more viable long term full replacement option, but those have their own issues.
I honestly believe that Europe is on its way to become completely energy independent sooner rather than later, having been pushed towards it by Russia.
Hopefully we'll see more funding go to fusion research and incentives as well.
An energy independent Europe may be a critical blow to fossil fuel companies around the world.
I'm quietly hoping that the reason for the slow progress is fossil fuel companies lobbying to keep funding relatively low and not actual scientific or engineering issues holding it back, and that their influence is being cut back (at least in the EU) to allow that field to progress faster.
If you asked me what was easier to engineer, a reliable, stable long-term energy positive fusion plant or one of those flying aircraft carriers from the superhero movies, I'd lean towards the aircraft carrier.
