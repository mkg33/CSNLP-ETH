I wonder how he really reconciles his tenure with Trump in his own conscience.
Say what you will about him, he’s legit religious, and it seems if I were the same way I wouldn’t be able to live with myself.
Of course he’s also a piece of shit, but he’s not the same caliber of “Christian” as the rest of the GQP.
Perhaps trump was his god testing him, and he failed miserably, lol.
Any elected official that's been part of the Republican party for more than half a second is a piece of shit.
They've openly been on a warpath against non-white people, women, and the LGBT community for decades (like, at least as far back as ) because they can't win elections running on their real platform (destroying social security, medicare, federal agencies like the EPA and FTC, and basically everything else FDR ever did), and they all chose to join and support it anyway.
The Liz Cheneys and Paul Ryans and Mike Pences of the world always come along after they've been kicked off the crazy train sounding reasonable and nice, but don't forget who they were and who they associated with for years behind closed doors.
