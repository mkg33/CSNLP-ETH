A lot of countries are sympathetic to Russia either because of investment, opposition former colonial powers now in NATO, or just strongman dictators who want to be like Putin.
Right now, they are watching from the sidelines with no eagerness to back a failing Russian campaign.
If they think there's suddenly something to be gained by siding with Russia or just that they see Russia as their only ally who is about to get annihilated until suddenly another big power joins them and foresee the same thing happening to themselves, they will be coming out of the woodwork to support Russia.
For example, let's say Russia gets targeted somewhere deep inside Russian territory that hits a little too close to home for Putin and they find a way to convince Iran or China or someone else along those lines that this was definitely NATO striking them.
If you're fighting a defensive war against an invading neighbor then strikes across the border on military targets are a completely legitimate defensive tactic.
Perhaps not a land invasion, but inserting covert spec-ops teams deep into Russian territory to sabotage military targets, rescue POWs, assassinate war criminals and military leaders, and encourage partisans ought to be easy and on the table when Ukrainians speak fluent Russian, know FSB tactics, know the land, etc.
