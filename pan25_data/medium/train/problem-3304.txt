There was an article in ether WSJ or WaPo (paywalled either way) comparing how Ukraine and Russia used precision munitions.
In short both HIMARS and Russian cruise missiles had similar capabilities; they are roughly as accurate and carry similar explosive loads albeit the cruise missiles have longer range.
Russia has used its cruise missiles to destroy civilian infrastructure with minimal strategic impact.
Ukraine has used HIMARS against Russian supply and command centers to make significant gains on the battlefield.
Operating a ship means wear and tear, reducing engine life, metal fatigue in the hull, etc.
Warships are replaced every 20 - 30 years.
Wasting the Russian Black Sea fleet against Ukraine means leaving a gaping hole in Russia's southern approaches.
Somehow, I do not think Ukraine will use their dockyards and engineering talent to replace the Moskva battleship or other craft they built for the Soviet Union ).
When you're buying shells from the starving because you can't keep up, you should reconsider your life choices.
