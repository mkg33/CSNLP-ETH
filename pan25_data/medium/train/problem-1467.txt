We just made the final decision to pull our kid out.
We are online homeschooling for the rest of the year and will reevaluate this summer.
It’s not just because of fear of guns - the parents of the kids at my kids school are raising their kids to be absolute hellions, and unfortunately my kid isn’t influencing, but being influenced.
My kid also can’t count by 2s or 5s half way through first grade because it hasn’t been taught to her yet.
Im not from Texas, and I really don’t like Texas.
People are trigger happy and generally really nasty.
I’m looking forward to moving outie.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
