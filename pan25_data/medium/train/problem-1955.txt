NATO invades Ukraine under pretenses of defending national sovereignty, Zelensky ordered all UAF personnel to surrender to NATO forces 1 hour after the invasion.
NATO occupies Ukraine, propping up a Ukrainian provisional government under the “old” Zelensky Regime.
Ukraine is now part of NATO.
Since Russia is fighting Ukraine which is a part of NATO, Ukraine uses article 5.
3,000 M1A2 Abrams of the Polish newly formed Armored Hussars and the 3,000 black F-35s of Dark Brandon descends upon the conscriptovitchs.
Three months later, All of NATO head of state is having dinner and discussing what to do with the new Russian Republic in the new Kremlin so graciously funded by the US MIC.

Russia is the ultimate green activist - overpopulation?
Russia fix.
Oil and gas causing pollution?
Russia fix.
Coral reefs in danger?
Believe it or not, Russia fix!
Fully agree with you.
But I really want to see NATO tanks parading through the Kremlin.
A childish fantasy one might say but I still want to dream dammit.
