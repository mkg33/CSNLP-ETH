My cousin who did a pretty broad asian trip says it would be very helpful if you at least learn the basic chinese linguo to get around/buy things.
Its modernized, but relatively speaking when comparing it to like japan, may be a bit harder.
You won't have much trouble in Taipei or Kaohsiung.
It's harder in less popular or smaller cities (f.e.
last time I was in Taichung all buses stations were written in Chinese exclusively, and the city didn't have any subway network at the time), but you will always find someone to help you even if they don't speak English.
Younger people speak English without much issue.
Yes, super foreigner friendly, it was actually my first country in Asia and I was surprised at how easy it was to get around.
I'd recommend some basic Chinese such as numbers or saying the time, but with modern tech, GPS and translator on your phone you won't have much issue.
It's more important to (try to) get a grasp of what behaving correctly is by looking around you and emulate what you see.
You may have some troubles with public transportation in Taichung, Tainan.
But it is very clear once you arrive in Hsinchu, Taoyuan and Taipei.
