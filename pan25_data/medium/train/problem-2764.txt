The crazies ARE the Party.
This is what happens when your Party refuses to change a single aspect of their political philosophy, policy goals, and refuse to appeal to any other demographic.
They’re just gonna keep courting more and more crazy people until alienating everyone who isn’t actively insane wants nothing to do with them.
It’s already happening, which is why “National Divorce” and “Christian Nationalism” is suddenly de rigueur among their ranks.
They can see the finish line and know it’s either steal power, or lose forever.
My money, personally, is on the latter.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
