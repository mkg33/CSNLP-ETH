Self government is a bit of a misnomer, they still have to follow federal and state law.
Basically They run there own municipality with the exception of police they pay for and run all the infrastructure(power, water, fire, etc) to support the park themselves.
They can also issue there own building permits which have even stricter standards than the state.
So that lets them do construction as they please without having to constantly run to the state for every time they need to do some minor thing.
So it cuts down on red tape and saves the taxpayers money.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
