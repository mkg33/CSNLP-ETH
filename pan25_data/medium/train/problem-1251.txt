We've had one since the cold war, when we were first hearing about the possibility of spy balloons taking pics and sending them remotely.
From what I remember, it's a missile designed to fly past the balloon, shoot a bola type ballast to its payload, that weighs it down without it crashing too hard so the payload could be examined in less than a thousand pieces.
imagine those balloons are filled with even more and dangerous bacteria/virus and china wants them to be blown up and the wind can carry shit around from the heights for a bigger spread of the virus.
How can we stop these “balloon men”?
I’m thinking we train monkeys to shoot various weapons at them at strategic defense points.
Maybe one super monkey….
They'll just shoot the balloon down over a small town.
Human lives are something they seek to control, not preserve.
So long as it only kills a few people and doesn't cause mass panic, whatever.
Definitely could be true.
With the advancements in photography, you could probably streak past the balloon in a jet and get enough footage to know what's what without needing to ground it.
