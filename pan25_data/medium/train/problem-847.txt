My fervent hope is for Trump to lose the primary.
Because then he'd spent the rest of the election season either coping and malding on Truth Social, or becoming a third-party candidate and ruining Republican plans.
I've mentioned this on other subreddits before.
If Trump doesn't get the nomination over DeSantis, I can totally see him starting his own party.
If that happens, this will be Bush/Clinton/Perot situation where Trump steals a significant number of votes.
Might even be worse as democrats voted for Perot as well.
I highly doubt democrats will vote for Trump after all these years of Trump shenanigans.
That will put Texas in a bind, as the worst US state.
What will be their gut instinct?
Pass emergency legislation to make an exception for Trump?
Or stick to their guns knowing a split Republican ticket will likely turn them blue?
Some states are worse at some things, but no state can match the sheer cumulative shittiness of Texas.
For example.
Texas is the worst polluting state in the US.
So much so that it pollutes twice as much as California despite having almost 11 million fewer people.
It pollutes more than the 3rd, 4th, and 5th most states combined.
Pollution is so bad that in parts of Texas, birth defect rates are 40-70% above the national average, as are cancer rates.
Texans also use more power than the national average, and more than 50% more than Californians per capita.
Texas, despite its state government agents claiming to be Pro Life, has the most infant deaths every year, despite having 50,000 fewer births than California.
Its maternal mortality rate is even worse, being 8 times higher than California, and worse than places like Serbia and Cuba.
And Texans live shorter lives.
Two and a half years fewer than Californians.
The life expectancy for the poor and homeless is more than three years shorter than even New York.
