The lyrics (the English lyrics) are actually horrifying though.
Basically describing what seems to be a global outbreak of war.
A lot of people on reddit don't seem like they're really reading the nuances of what is being said and understanding the implications of it.
I don't blame them, whatever global problem cough he is referring to is overshadowed by the outright lies and incompetence coming from the government right now.
They repeat the same game over and over, with those innocent qualifying statements.
They haven't literally said "no", which would be the best answer in a simple world where they don't know anything about any ETs.
It would be the answer that calms the public, but for some reason they can't do that.
Its curious though.
If you, by chance, told a profound truth in the midst of a bunch of lies, it also would look like a lie.
But why lie?
When you can make the truth sound like a lie?
“The war machine springs to life, opens up one eager eye”.
Damn that is really scary.
I hope we are not in these times.
