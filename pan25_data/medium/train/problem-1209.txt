There’s no intelligence claim in the article.
The full quote, which isn’t given, was probably along the lines of ‘We know Putin has had cancer for a long time, he will die quickly I hope.’ The quoted words Wales Online has given us are chopped up and rearranged to make it sound like the highly intelligent, extremely cagey military man who rarely gives interviews, revealed some profound bit of intelligence to ABC news.
He didn’t.
The interview summary I found from ABC doesn’t even mention Budanov’s hopes for Putin’s health.
"Now maybe you don't have tumors.
Well, don't worry.
If you sat on a folding chair in the lobby and weren't wearing lead underpants, we took care of that too!
".
I’m gonna be real with you chief, as much as I’d love for this to happen it’s seeming a bit more like wishful thinking than solid intelligence.
A formless universe that pays attention to you and wants to do things for you is super different from an old man who pays attention to you and wants to do things for you, trust me.
