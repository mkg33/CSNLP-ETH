But, we have to keep in mind with Hillary Clinton..like it or not.
And I’m not her biggest fan.
I didn’t even vote for her or Trump for that matter.
She was grilled for hours and hours and hours by Republicans no less and she was found innocent of any wrong doing.
Trump on the other hand.
Had a major role in 1-6-21 and refused to hand over classified documents after being asked to turn them over for months.
He said these documents are mine.
Now on to Biden.
He should of told us 2 months ago they found classified documents in 2 different places.
That said I do believe he had no prior knowledge of these documents.
Still it doesn’t look good.
This whole archive system needs a re haul.
