“The 25-year contract to export Iran's natural gas through a pipeline to Pakistan was signed between the two countries in 2009 and was supposed to be implemented by 2015, but international and US sanctions against Iran and Washinon’s pressure on Islamabad have prevented its implementation so far.
Quoting the article here - seemingly Pakistan has had 14 years to build the pipeline since the contract was originally signed.
The two sides inked a revised deal in September 2019.
Iran agreed not to approach any international court if Pakistan would finish the pipeline until 2024.”.
Tbf Pakistan may not exist come 2024, so who knows.
Iran still has a strong economy and has been able to fend off the west successfully for decades; silly to bet against them.
"Fend off the West" is code speak for killing unarmed peaceful protesters and "strong economy" is code speak for the elite and mullahs living like kings while average people are starving.
Illusioned arzeshi.
Probably not.
Piped gas is usually much cheaper than LNG.
You don't have to pay the ships, insurance, crew, and then all the LNG infrastructure is expensive too.
