State they are “willing” to negotiate— people remember they have done so they are not idiots.
It’s the difference of supporting them with no feasible end in sight or supporting them knowing at some point (like most every war) they will still be willing to go to the table.
It is simple perspective.
No one is asking them to negotiate and not hold their own at the table or give in to Russian insane demands — just keep on saying they are willing to end this at the table at some point.
If they can’t do that supporting them in effect means there will be no end (even if they push Russia out it will remain an active perpetual war).
tl:dr --- The US is noticing that some countries are beginning to falter in support for the Ukrainian war, with the majority of the rhetoric behind this decline being that Ukraine is not trying to do peace talks.
Basically this is just the US asking Ukraine to make a diplomatic gesture that Ukraine is trying every avenue for peace, the US knows these talks will not accomplish anything, but it makes for a good optics and makes it harder for people to stop supporting Ukraine since it's doing EVERYTHING it can, even if peace talks would be pointless.
