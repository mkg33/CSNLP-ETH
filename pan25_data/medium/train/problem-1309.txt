Some humans are pieces of crap, and some of the pieces of crap are in the police force, but i would hate to live in a society without a police force because none of the pieces of crap would ever be locked up.
The point people are making when they say this, is that if the "good" cops stay silent and don't act upon ousting the bad cops, then they are complicit and therefore not actually good cops.
i am not saying they are perfect, i am saying they are a necessary part of society, you can't say they are all bad because of a minority, or the same logic applies to humans, some humans are scum, so all humans are scum.
Yes, and here is why, because they stand silent or idle while their colleagues beat,rape,murder, and extort the public they vow to defend.
The police force is the biggest gang in America.
Example: this cop got away with it for nearly 2 decades all while being reported by women and his colleagues knew and did nothing to stop or protect those women.
Cops don’t turn each other in.
They cover for each other for all sorts of crimes.
if one cops is fired, they get hired in another district without any issues because that’s how the system is designed.
People don't choose to be human the way they choose to be cops.
Just like you can't remove people from being human the way you (theoretically) can remove someone from being a cop.
Sadly all cops are in a boy's club so expecting them to self-police is basically impossible.
They need real and serious oversight.
