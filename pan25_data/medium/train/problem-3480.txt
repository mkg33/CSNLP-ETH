I am pretty sure in terms of "I don't give a flying fuck what you think" Lukashenko is probably just ever so slightly above Putin for most Ukrainians.
That's the crazy thing to me--all of their mightier than thou declarations would be so threatening if they were winning the war and crushing Ukraine.
Instead they're being pushed back on nearly all fronts, Russia is rotting from within faster than ever before (allegedly), and the EU took the step to declare Russia a state sponsor of terrorism (which is a hefty charge loaded with diplomatic weight).
..... all the threats appear weak and feeble in the face of losing, and they keep losing more and more traction because they won't (can't?)
back up their threats.
Ukrainians aren't going to give up though.
As bad as things get, there's now nine months worth of video evidence from the occupied territories of just how much worse they'll get if Russia takes over.
The barbaric way the Russians have acted in Ukraine has basically guaranteed that the Ukrainians are going to fight to the last.
