The US government has eyes and ears everywhere, and then more even still to keep watch over them.
I don't think the US government would ever leverage Wagner directly, but I can absolutely see them infiltrating from a distance or simply tapping their communications; after all, the US's intelligence network doesn't just materialize out of thin air -- it requires endless effort from an absolutely staggering amount of personel and resources.
Putting organizations on the terror watchlist is akin to the Eye of Sauron fixing it's gaze on you: You tread much more carefully and take extra precautions, because you don't want to get found out.
That, in turns, makes it harder for the US to gather intelligence about you and those around you.
Why can't they be listed as terrorists?
I can kind of see the argument against Russia being designation as one, but their is no reason why Wagner can't be.
I think it's to do with the terminology under the International Religious Freedom Act.
Countries of Particular Concern is the term used there for nation states, so it makes sense for Groups of Particular Concern to be the terminology used for private organisations.
