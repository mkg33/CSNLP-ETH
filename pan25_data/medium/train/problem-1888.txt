This will be about removing sanctions on Australia for the abhorrent crime of asking for an independent investigation into the origins of Covid-19.
When the last prime minister asked for the unjust sanctions to be removed he was given a list of demands which would of violated our soveregnty, he leaked them to the press.
There was no demand and they asked for an impartial and independant investigation, not for the US state to inspect all their bio-labs.
China has no grounds to inspect U.S military bases.
6 million people died from covid, millions of people are suffering long term health problems and the economy is bordering on a recession thanks to Chinese incompetence.
Despite there being a free trade agreement between the two countries, China has been slapping tariffs, quotas, import restrictions and other trade sanctions on Australian companies and goods for purely political reasons.
Add in China buying and bribing influence in Solomon Islands, shining military lasers from Chinese navy vessels at Australian aircraft within Australian waters and countless other scandals and incidents and you can probably say relations between the two countries are at their lowest point in over 30 years.
