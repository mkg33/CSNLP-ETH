But going to places and speeches and so on?
That’s all staff.
Staff writes them, gives them to her, hers her to the place, tells her what to do and she reads their words; votes are harder, but not so hard that she should be fuckinh failing to vote on critical motions because she’s too out of it to track what’s going on and her staff can’t be with her in every location (like during a vote).
Her staff has been with her long enough to have empathy for her, or see this as their opportunity to gain power themselves by influencing her, or maybe they just don’t want to get blacklisted so they’re staying mum.
But no way they haven’t seen her memory fail her in seriously concerning ways regularly.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
