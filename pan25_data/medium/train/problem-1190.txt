The Russian people proudly present: .
Is your free press giving you trouble for operating a literal death camp?
Is your charade of anti-fascism falling apart because you're becoming a super-nazi that makes Hitler look like Gandhi?
Worry not, with this new concept some of the victims are released so that you can continue to torture innocent people to death with impunity while screaming that the Americans are doing it too to justify it all in your mind.
Calling it a filter sounds neutral, ensuring that people think you're on the right side of history while you torture people to death.
Only those who were considered unfit for work got sent directly to the gas chambers, the rest were typically used as slave labour until they were near death from hard work and starvation rations.
Then gas chambers.
Even in the nazi extermination camps, there were barracks housing victims.
Far from everyone were killed right away- but most were killed eventually.
Sounds like these are closer to slave labor and/or death camps than recruitment focused.
Which i guess they can recruit from, considering they've already recruited people totally unfit for military service.
Russia has shown they have trouble(potential for civil unrest) drafting troops, trouble providing equipment for troops, have had their tank and vehicle stockpiles decimated, are running low on precision munitions and have extremely limited ability to resupply themselves.
Just because they may have the potential to draft millions of untrained conscripts, doesn't mean that the casualties Ukraine has inflicted isn't remarkable and unprecedented in modern war.
Around 58,000 Americans died in Vietnam in a decade compared to over twice as many Russians in under a year.
They've killed over 120,000 Russian troops in under a year.
I agree they should keep going until the Russians withdraw from Ukrainian territory, but they have eliminated an astounding amount of the Russian army already.
