There's that.
The other major barrier to entry is the potential cost of repairs.
It's going to be fucking ridiculous, very few people can work on these cars so they are going to charge you unreasonable amounts of money.
That's the reason I sold my hybrid.
It ran perfectly untill like 250k and then started breaking down.
Doesn't really matter how much you save on gas when your getting hit with multi thousand dollar repair bills out of the blue.
Dealership wanted 5k for a new battery and installation.
Thankfully there was a company that I found that charges reasonable prices, like $1800.
But that's just the battery.
It started having engine trouble and I sold it for parts not wanting to end up wasting thousands for it to break down again.
We need more mechanics not associated with dealerships.
I chose to go back to gasoline cars because I can't risk the astronomical costs.
While 'cheaper' would surely be better, that's not the limiting factor at present.
The reason the number is only 11%, is that's as many as manufacturers can build so far.
Demand is surely much higher.
And when demand is high and supply is low, well, high prices are what you get.
