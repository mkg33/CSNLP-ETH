I don't know.
Not a rich person so I can only speak for myself, but I'd be happy to be severely taxed so that I only have enough to live on so long as it means everyone is provided for and everyone else is taxed down to the same level, too.
There’s something about not wanting to be the only one to play fair.
I'm guessing that many (not all) richies would be okay losing the top end of their wealth if all their friends/rivals did too.
But they aren't going to voluntarily avoid loopholes and tax havens if they know no one else will and it will only make them look less successful by comparison.
It's all a game of status.
This is just a safe comment from a few to make them look good, it’s just rich people virtue signaling.
They realize that the mega donors for the DNC and RNC won’t let those things happen, even if they ask for them.
I think a lot of these people are capitalist sociopaths.
They understand the ethics of taxation and civil duty, so they’re smart enough to say “tax us.” But that doesn’t translate into a positive duty they should fulfill of their own accord.
They view it as a game wherein strict adherence to their own self-interest is their right and ethical part to play, and it’s the government’s duty to enforce altruism onto them.
It’s a cat-and-mouse game and they call it political order.
