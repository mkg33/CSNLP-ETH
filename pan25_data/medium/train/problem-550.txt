Gen -X here, married to a Boomer.
We’ve also got your backs.
We hate the Republican Party and what they represent.
We don’t think the Dems have any good messaging, either, but we see the shitty economy screwing Millennials and Gen-Z to the max and we have to vote to snuff out the extremists who want to end social security and medicare and break up unions.
We will not stand by and allow the rich continue to get richer, with dumb ass CEO’s and corporate owners making massive amounts of people serve them as victims without adequate pay, health care or vacation or leave time.
Our country ranks the highest in infant mortality as a “first” world Nation, because our health care is so shitty.
OK, I’ll get off my soap box now.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
