They have the legal right if they are seeking asylum, which there is a different process for that doesn’t involve crossing the border illegally.
Most illegal immigrants nowadays do not come from Mexico, but South America, and many (and probably the vast vast majority) are not actually fleeing for their lives but rather for economic opportunity.
Seems reasonable to not bring them over the border, give them a court date, and release them into the interior of the country they were trying to illegally enter and hope they show up for their court date.
