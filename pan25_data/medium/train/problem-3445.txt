It's not at all relevant to the discussion, but the story told in 300 doesn't really purport to be historically accurate as it's really just a piece of Spartan propaganda told by the one surviving member of Leonidas's 300.
Dilios spins this fanciful tale portraying his countrymen as the sole bastion against the demonic Persian horde.
Is it a faithful recollection?
No.
Does it make a better story for an action movie?
I'd say yes, but I realise it's not to everyone's taste.
What's the endgame for Putin here?
Let's say they do win Ukraine then what?
Is Putin expecting whole world to just go "Oh well, time to make deals with Russia gain"?
Plus, where is Russia going to get equipment to outfit these extra 500k soldiers?
Their current army isn't properly equipped.
It's crazy how far they are willing to take this farce.
Every step they take makes them a bigger pariah on an international scale.
The West is less and less willing to work with them, while the East takes bigger advantage of their poor standing for personal gain.
All of which makes Russia weaker and weaker.
