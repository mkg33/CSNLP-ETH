Primaries are not about the general election.
It’s about electorate composition.
What’s more representative of the party.
Not 90% white Iowa or New Hampshire.
South Carolina is a smaller state and it is diverse.
The party is a multi-racial coalition so it makes sense to have SC first.
If you start with a large state, that will just guarantee only wealthy candidates can start and stay on top because larger states have expensive media markets.
You could argue Nevada first but that’d be ignoring the base of the party which is black voters.
But Nevada should be one of the first few.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
