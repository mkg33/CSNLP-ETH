Why?
Americans got that word from the British.
Hell the Brits used soccer until the 1970s.
The Brits are weird for flip-flopping, at least in this one regard America stayed consistent.
Are there even snooker tournaments with national teams?
It's hard to base your whole identity on a snooker player individual and go out rioting with like minded folks like those football sad pieces of sht drunkards.
Well it's more based on the competing players nationality.
For example: you're more likely going to get Australians identifying and supporting Neil Robertson, and Scottish people supporting John Higgins rather than the other way around.
Obviously there is nothing wrong with people supporting whoever.
Football vs snooker, they appear to be 2 majority different types of supporters.
Maybe it boils down to social class?
This isn't backed by anything but football fans tend to be from poorer backgrounds in comparison to say snooker fans or water polo fans.
It's less likely you'd see people from upper society behaving like football hooligans.
Maybe we just need to raise the class of football a bit, change the kits to shirt and tie hehe might make for an interesting change.
I understand where you're coming from but by saying French or French with Morrocan origins, you kinda totally said something else.

That's what I was reacting to.

Paris population composition is quite broader and more diverse that.
Go read it about.
My reply was addressing this comment.... That's not true.
It simply doesn't matter how you cut it...
