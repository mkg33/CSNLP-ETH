Something to get people fired up about.

They don’t actually care about cannabis.
They aren’t Christian puritans.
Once there is money to be had, they will always relinquish their previous platforms built on doom and the Devil.

Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
