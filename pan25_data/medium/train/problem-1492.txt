Countries/regions that had severe shutdown policies in the beginning that was able to severely limit spread of COVID seem to where massive spread and fatalities are occurring now.
My theory is that because they were so isolated, they have not built any sort of resistance to it.
In general, I think our immune systems as a whole have been noticeable weaker, likely due to our general isolation from each other weaken our abilities to build natural immunity to other diseases.
This flu season seems to be affecting us harder than usual.
Japan being a country with shit ton more vulnerable old people than healrhy young ones might be soley to blame for the mortality rate despite of it having good vaccine track record.
Because if we had China data mass panic would start.
Problem is we need the real data to prepare and since no measure was able to maintain society functioning and save lives at the same time WE NEED THE ACTUAL RAW DATA TO BE THE REAL DATA so people can plan for themselves and organize.
