Have you seen the new "voter ID" laws in florida which require voters to add an ID number (such as drivers license or last 4 of social) on their absentee ballots for them to count?
The asinine thing is that most people register with their DL number, but when you're filling out a form you're not going to pull out your DL, you're going to use the last 4 (even though that's a security cluster) but the clerk who has to process your ballot doenst have your social on file so they're going to throw your ballot out.
No American should vote for any Republican for any office - local, state, or federal - until this fascist ideology is brought down and its harm has been repaired.
Republicans are a fascist party and always have been.
Fascism is colonialism turned inwards and they've always been into that.
The only way to cull the fascism is to defeat the GOP and then vote out the centrists among the Dems.
Really though, that's not the entire solution either.
