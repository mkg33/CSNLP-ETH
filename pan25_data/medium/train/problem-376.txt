I believe they could also change the rule for electing a speaker to say move to a plurality, but that would be very risky for the Republicans since Jeffries has the plurality right now and I would not be surprised if the 20 decide to call the McCarthy backers bluff since they could likely remove Jeffries later and restart the whole fight.
This is a risky play, if they change the rules to a plurality, and the 20 stick to their guns, you'll see a Democrat speaker presiding over a Republican house.
Probably unacceptable to the 20, so they might bend, but what if...
No one has mentioned it yet, but the reason is simple: they're legally only allowed to do two things right now.
They can nominate a Speaker, which requires a majority of members to agree, or they can move to recess until a particular future time... which also requires a majority of members to agree.
There's no point they simply have no choice.
My understanding is that right now there is only 3 things that the members-elect can do; Nominate a speaker and hold a vote, Motion to adjourn and hold a vote, Motion to change the rules for electing a speaker and hold a vote.
Because they aren't members they can't do much of anything except find a way to elect a speaker who can then swear them in.
