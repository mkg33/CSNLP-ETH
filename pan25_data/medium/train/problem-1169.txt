NATO also adjusts it's messaging, but without nukes because NATO does not need nukes.
That is why Stoltenberg and Blinken remind Putin every time with plain, unbuttered claims like "war is possible" to propose a quick, conventional solution to the threat, which is realistic as well because NATO is not just USA; it's Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Montenegro, Netherlands, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States + allies who will definitely want street cred like Finland, Sweden, South Korea, Japan etc.
For anyone confused about Russia’s constantly shifting justifications for their illegal war of aggression, this is straight out of the Russian propaganda playbook.
Throw a million insane conspiracy theories out into the mainstream so as to cover up the actual truth with a mountain of nonsense so that people get fatigued and don’t know how to identify the truth.
