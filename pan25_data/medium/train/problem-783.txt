Usually it's a problem with "last mile" logistics too.
In the 80's millions of tons of donated food rotted on the docks in Ethiopia.
Mostly due to corruption, but distribution was definitely a problem.
It's not logistics at all.
We get food to and from every corner of the world, and did so even during the pandemic.
The inconvenient part is that the people who need it are likely to be the people least able to pay.
But it is.
Logistics accounts for the costs of shipping and storing and transport of goods.
The food already exists.
The ability to get it where it needs to be in the time it needs before it spoils is the real issue.
I guess unless you say that people would rather let it spoil/expire rather than give it away for free.
Which is probably a reality.
I guess it depends on the point of view that you are taking, since logistics is normally purely materialistic.
Not a business point of view where monetary price is an additional restriction, but not actually a real logistical problem.
"Lmao", food would get there tomorrow if the places suffering famine had the money.
Logistics require money to function, sure, but let's not pretend that the problem in any way lies in capability.
Where I live in Illinois (and also a huge percentage of the state), the black organic soil is at least two feet deep.
Some of the best soil in the country and the world.
