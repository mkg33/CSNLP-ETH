So an Islamic Military Junta takes over the country unconstitutionally violating the agreement to be part of the duty-free agreement, and are as such, cut off from it.
Sounds perfectly reasonable to me.
How so?
Thomas Sankara helped build up Burkina Faso’s infrastructure, healthcare and educational systems.
Most of his programs were the most wildly successful on the continent.
His healthcare reforms helped drop the infant mortality rate from 20.8% to 14.5%.
His administration added almost 700km of rail lines built without foreign aid.
I could go on and on and on, but this “hE’s A cOmMuNiSt TaNkIe is bs and you’re probably also the type that thinks that liberals and marxists are the same.
The take over was necessary to fight the jihadist insurgents.
The country is battling against terrorists and the last administration was unable to eradicate the situation.
Edit: The current regime is not Islamist, however they are fighting an Islamist insurgency, the former government was unable to effectively counter the insurgency.
Just to clarify, the military ruler is not an Islamist, in fact he has a history of fighting Islamists, and his stated reason for the coup is the lack of progress against them.
However he is not explicitly pro-west hence the reason for US action.
