I live in a small mountain town that gets millions of tourists every year, and the Chinese tourists (ie people from china, not Chinese Americans) are widely loathed for their behavior, because it is mostly viewed as rude, crude, dangerous or annoying much of the time.
From making a mess of toilets b/c they literally stand on the seats and get shit and pee everywhere (we now have picture signs instructing Chinese people how to use them, but they still shit everywhere), to not observing smoking laws, littering, to walking in the middle of streets and causing traffic problems, not giving people personal space, getting too close to wildlife, feeding wildlife, not respecting private property (ie trespassing because they wanted to take photos), being terrible at driving and parking (ie blocking roads, ignoring signs), etc etc.
I appreciate cultural differences, as a traveller, and always try to observe cultural norms and expectations, out of consideration and politeness.
The Chinese have earned a reputation as anything but polite or considerate of even our basic laws, never mind cultural norms.
It’s like China is mad they fucked up and now have an out of control spread, so let’s make the rest of the world writhe in agony with us.
That’s pretty fucked up.
