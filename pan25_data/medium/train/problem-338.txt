I've always wondered why it matters to anyone whether or not they are remembered.
A) You'll be dead and won't be able to experience or enjoy the fame anymore.
B) all it takes is an asteroid impact, super volcano, global flood, nuclear holocaust, etc.
to completely erase most, or all, of human history.
One of those things will eventually happen again.
Not to mention the Sun will go super nova eventually.
I get that some people are sociopaths with egos that needs constant attention, and I get the appeal of wanting to be remembered in general.
But it's all just made up BS and none of it actually justifies hurting and killing anyone.
In the end it's all just going to be gone.
So why not just strive to live a good life that doesn't harm anyone?
Life is too short and precious to get wrapped up in all the negative crap, lies, and hate.
It really doesn't make sense to me, and it makes me sad that most people don't think this way.
They would rather let the news tell them what to think, and rarely seem to think for themselves.
Not to mention the endless hypocrisy, and manipulation.
I can't stand any of it.
What ever happened to live and let live, do unto others, and love thy neighbor?
We all share this tiny spec of dust flying through endless space for such a brief moment in time, and yet we all just keep being greedy, ignorant, controlling, and oblivious assholes to each other for no good reason at all.
You can thank Elon Musk for what’s happening to Twitter He’s an egotistical, self-centered maniac Look at what he’s done to Tesla He actually is on the side of the Russians.
