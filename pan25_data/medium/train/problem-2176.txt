EU already has something like this, but only for domestic production.
This extends it to imports, reducing the incentive to move those industries out of Europe and thus strenhening European production.
The problem is when this leads to the consumer's quality of life to decline and they vote in populists who will make this and other policies worse than where we started from.
Countries willing to buy and sell carbon-produced items will be able to do so cheaper than their European counterparts.
The major problem with this kind of approach is pretty simple: the WTO doesn't recognize "climate-related tariffs" as some kind of special category.
Once the EU actually starts levying the tariff, other countries are going to go to the WTO with complaints, and those countries are going to win those complaints.
The end result is going to be retaliatory tariffs against EU exports.
If you want an environment in which such tariffs can be charged, you're going to have to get countries to agree to a new trade treaty that allows for such tariffs; the outlook for other countries signing on to a treaty like that is exceptionally poor.
There's probably not any way to square the circle between "China and India want to increase emissions because they have a ton of desperately poor people they'd like to industrialize" and "the US won't agree to emissions cuts if China and India can continue to increase their emissions".
There's REALLY no chance that you're going to get China and India to agree to let the EU levy a climate tariff on their goods.
