Heh, I remember watching a documentary that followed a group of Chinese tourists around France.
While there were plenty of cultural-confusion moments, the two that stood out for me were when they went to tour Louis the 14's palace, but couldn't because the workers were striking.
One Chinese factory owner just couldn't understand how the police/government couldn't force the strikers to work.
The other moment was right after, since the palace was closed, they could only tour the gardens.
They were shocked at how clear and clean the water was in the ponds.
Their incredulous reactions to both the striking workers and the clean water was depressing.
Than the youths hatred of the elderly control and disrespect towards them.
The old toke control to create the CCP 75 years ago the old are abusings that power they stole.
Time will tell.
I don't doubt that Xi's government will attempt to put this down as brutally and violently as possible.
The real question is how much the Chinese citizenry decide to stand up.
