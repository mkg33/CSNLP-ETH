This is a great question, though in this instance you mean, who was running Zimmerman's oppo research, as he went through a consulting firm, oppo research isn't done on a party-wide level.
I've read as much as I can find and the most i can tell you is Zimmerman paid a consulting firm $22k and they entirely skipped Santos' bio info.
IMO that consulting firm's name should be plastered on every headline that mentions Santos.

Itâ€™s basically still the same system as the late 19th century.
A small number of party bosses direct all the funds to either themselves, their cronies, or punishing their enemies (often fellow Democrats).
