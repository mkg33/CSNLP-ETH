I would agree that a significant number of Republicans do share hatred towards the LGBTQ+ community, however....
It's not as simple as all Republicans feel this way, or all democrats feel this way...
It's just not that black and white...
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
I'd say that's pretty obvious to everyone, not just LGBTQ people.
The Republicans haven't exactly been shy about their hate for those things, and have so far already been doing everything in their power to destroy them.
But, the fact is that way, way more Republicans do feel that way than Democrats, to the point where it's completely accepted and even encouraged by their leaders.
It's basically policy, whether literally stated as such or not.
Doesn't have to be black and white to be able to say that, as a whole, the Republican party is extremely hostile towards the LGBTQ community.
It's kind of their thing.
I pass, all my legal stuff is changed, so I'm pretty privileged and safe.
I have a large cache/supply of hormones in case they make adult hrt illegal here.
I fully expect some vile legislation out of Texas.
I hope the fact that the Dems have the executive branch will keep their worst excesses in check.
