Personally, my hygge is hurt by warm light.
It appears excessively artificial to me and hurts my mood as a result because I know it isn't close to real light.
I would rather have daylight lights as I am never looking directly at the bulbs themselves and rather their effects.
I know that I have lights on when I turn them on so I see it more as an extension of daylight rather than replacing it.
Even during the day, any place that has yellow lights actually tends to hurt my mood more than it helps it.
Wikipedia Ukraine had some 17 million households in 2007.
If just 10 million of them have only one of those bulbs on, and each saves 50 W compared to an incandescent one, that's already a total of 500 MW reduction of demand, or a somewhat decently sized power plant.
Granted, nowhere near all of those will replace incandescent lightbulbs.
LED lights aren't exactly new, and CFL ones before them were almost as efficient, but not all households will spend their evenings with the entire family gathered under one light in the living room, either.
