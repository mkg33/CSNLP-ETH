Another redditor commented that Carter wasn't the best president, but he was the best person to serve as president.
I think that puts it pretty nicely.
your consciousness will always have "lived" in the place and time that it did.
experiencing linear time makes it seem that the past is somehow less-than the present, but that's al illusion you shed when you die.
In death, time is no longer experienced, linear or otherwise, and as such the existence of your consciousness is on the same plane as all others to have ever existed or that will ever exist.
