It should be noted Canadian Public Servants were just ordered back into the office 2 to 3 days a week, regardless of where they live relative to their team or how feasible remote/highly felxible hybrid is for their job functions.
It really demonstrates how serious Canada is about GHG reductions from low hanging fruit, being daily commuting.
Traffic congestion also increases GHG, which means less cars on the road, allowing those that are on the road to move more efficiently would be ideal.
The reckless and greedy capitalists don't care.. until we regulate these harmful industries out of business they'll keep doing whatever it takes to make huge piles of cash.
Humans are greedy and reckless no matter what economic model.
It's just not reasonable to suggest an economic model is going to change human core behavior all that much.
Capitalism and Socialism still get torn apart by corruption and greed on a regular basis because humans are always look for advantages over each other.
I think the only reasonable way to reduce that is to provide humans core needs very cheap and even then we will compete for no other reason than just because we feel like it.
In socialism appropriations of funds and favoritism still don't produce some kind of equal/free and greed free society.
You just put more eggs in the basket of capitalism or socialism when in reality your best bet is probably to balance capitalism with socialism in a public vs private power equilibrium.. not bet it all on one or the other because you consolidate too much power to private or public sectors and that only makes greed easier.
It's power consolidation that amplified greed the most.
If you can pit the great forces against each other, that's where the individual will get the most freedom and options, not the all or nothing thinking of this vs that.
