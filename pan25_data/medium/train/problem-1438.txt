Mexico is a larger trading partner than Canada now, and I believe rapidly growing during W time so that makes some sense.
Canada is a closer ally and still very large trading partner but now 1/6 US citizen share genetic family links to Mexico.
That is a big deal for future relations.
possibly he broke from tradition as he’s already met trudeau on official capacity during his time as VP, so no formal introduction as leaders is necessary.
definitely so, but its not often that the PM of canada meets the VP in the states in a ceremonial capacity, then the VP becomes president and the same PM is still serving.
like second term presidents don’t normally prioritize revisiting canada if the PM hasn’t changed or vice versa.
so this is bidens third term in the oval office while trudeaus still around.
As per another comment - it really doesn't bother me that Biden is going elsewhere first.
Or really anyone I know.
It would however bother quite a lot of people if he DIDNT visit Canada at all during his term.
Whether intentional or not, that would send a really negative message to a very close ally & partner.
