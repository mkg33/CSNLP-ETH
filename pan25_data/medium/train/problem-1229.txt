to my knowledge this wonderful guy had a stint in Guantanamo as legal advisor: essentially his role was to tell the staff what the "legal" torture methods would be.
I dated a retired Marine who constantly would say "what do you think lady will two degrees" It didn't take me long to remove myself from seeing him.
Plus he parroted Fox news instead of thinking for himself.
