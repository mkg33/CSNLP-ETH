Correct.
This is a tempest in a teapot and the objection is purely philosophical.
Australia is one of America's closest allies, essentially on the same level as the UK and Canada.
That relationship enjoys basically unanimous support in both US political parties.
If we get to a point where the US is denying support to the Aussies in a real shooting war, the world is probably ending anyway.
Assuming you’re correct, how do you think this is different from our current political and military posture?
You think we’re going to go bombing anyone with F-35’s without running it by our allies, or running Abrams through someone’s back yard?
And the defence minister is right - most of Australia's high-end military kit is already American and to some extent relies on support from US-based contractors, so this issue is not exactly a departure from the status quo.
We have military alliances.
We aren’t going to get into an offensive shooting war without consulting our allies, and I doubt very much they’d prevent us defending ourselves, even if they could.
