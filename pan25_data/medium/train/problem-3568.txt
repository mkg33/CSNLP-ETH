If Trump had won in 2020, the conservatives would be tripping over themselves to talk about how amazing and perfect “Trump’s vaccine” is and anybody pointing out how the vaccine is less effective than initially thought would be shut down as fake news.
I mean they're against a vaccine for a goddamn plague and it was their president that made it happen.
The only thing they give a shit about is hurting people, even if the people are themselves.
Edit: Obviously he didn't actually "make it happen," it just happened on his watch.
Small but important distinction.
