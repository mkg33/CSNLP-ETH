The countries this happened in are Gambia, Indonesia and Uzbekistan.
There are four additional countries where this cough syrup might have been sold: Cambodia, the Philippines, East Timor and Senegal.
This has been going on since JULY 2022.
Which likely answers a question I had during the holiday cold snap.
A gifted bottle of JD Cinnamon imbued whiskey left outside remained a syrupy liquid in -38C (80 proof vodka was frozen already!)
and I wondered what chemagical sorcery was afoot.
It's likely that somebody at some point in the supply chain thought they could save some money by substituting in a cheaper source of glycerol, or maybe they mixed up the two similar-looking chemicals.
Glycerol is a common ingredient in cough syrups because it's syrupy, it's mildly sweet-tasting, lots of things dissolve easily in it, and it will prevent sugar from crystallizing.
Food grade glycerol is pure and safe to consume (it's probably in something you've eaten or put on your skin today), but sometimes glycerol intended for use as an industrial solvent or soap/shampoo additive is contaminated with ethylene glycol, which has similar properties (but is toxic).
They actually removed propylene glycol from Fireball a while ago.
You'd have to drink a whole lot of whiskey to get sick from the propylene glycol, though, and the alcohol itself would make you sick at that point.
They removed it because many customers didn't want to drink a substance that's used as an antifreeze.
There was a scandal back in the 80s where a bunch of Austrian wineries intentionally adulterated their wines with small amounts of diethylene glycol (the toxic one) to make cheap wines taste sweeter and fuller.
In most cases the amount wasn't enough to make people sick, since alcohol actually acts as an "antidote" to diethylene glycol poisoning... but there were some bottles that contained a lethal dose if the whole bottle was consumed.
Although no one died, there were some possible cases of liver failure.
