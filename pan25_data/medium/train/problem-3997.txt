They do this shit constantly.
They'll measure or investigate something in an intentionally half-assed way to use it against the opposition.
That doesn't matter, because conservatives will (as usual) believe whatever is maximally convenient for their personal agenda.
If measuring inflation in a deliberately slimy or dishonest way gets them to their end goal of complete and total control over literally everything, they will measure it as dishonestly as physically possible.
