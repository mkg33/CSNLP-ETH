Knock this ignorant dog shit off.
In just this thread, I’ve had one of you trolls try to convince people Putin isn’t capable of forming a two-word thought, thus we needn’t worry about him using a dangerous criminal to buy weapons, even though that’s all this guy does, and clearly a lie.
I’ve had at least 5 of you trolls try the same nonsense you just tried to pull with your dumb “he can’t restart his own business” even though no one suggested he was going to do in the first place, segued sloppily into the same “WhY wOuLd PuTIn, wHo Is CuRrEnTlY vErY pUbLiClY bEiNg EmBaRaSsEd On ThE wOrLd StAgE fOr HiS wEaK aSs MiLiTaRy TrY tO eMpLoY a GuN rUnNeR hE dOeSnT eVeN hAvE tO pAy?” lazy, nonsensical excuses.
An arms dealer who is in no small part partially responsible for the critical lack of military hardware and ammunition that's killing Russian servicemen at an alarming rate and they applaud his safe return?
Is it mandatory to have a cocaine addiction or something to work in the Kremlin, cuz the logic in celebrating Victor's return is just not there.
