“Look folks, I love the Indians.
My good friend is the PM of India and he has some ideas about Muslims.
Boy you thought… you thought I was bad?
This guy… folks this guy - let’s just say he’s very opinionated.
Anyways I love the ind - my uncle once took me to an Indian restaurant owned by a fellow Wharton grad - you know, prestigious business school, smart guy really smart guy just like me - Anyways the owner is Indian and he comes up to me, tears in his eyes - folks I was 19 years old - he says “Mr.
Future President, you have to do something about Indians in US politics” even back then he knew, and I knew, and you know Hillary knew, that Indians were gonna be bad- they were going to be bad news.
And he was right, so was my uncle, and so was I.”.
