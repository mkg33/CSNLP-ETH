My first time in Amsterdam, I got caught in the middle of a drawbridge when it started to open.
I couldn’t get back to the barrier by the time it was down, so I stood right next to it.
Afterwards, this Policeman cycles up to me in the most non-threatening Dutch way possible.
He says “if I see you do this again, I will be forced to give you a ticket.” Then he cycled away.
When I was an extremely dumb kid, I bought some mushrooms in Amsterdam, and went for a wander, becoming extremely lost, ending up in a nice park that I could take a breather in.
The nice policeman showed up shortly to shoo my confused and tripping ass away, with the kindly advice of "try not to get robbed.
".
But we're not progressive about drugs.
Germany is getting a more progressive soft drugs policy than the Netherlands now.
Portugal decriminalised drugs in 2000.
We're way behind the times.
Lol yeah I know, I think they meant some other government place.
I just accepted it for simplicity.
But I doubt that The Hague would have much less tourists that want to try drugs.
But I doubt they can stay for long in the Binnenhof with all those farmers and trekkers there .
It's just that Amsterdam got the sex and drug capital reputation in the '60s, and never managed to shake it, resulting in most Dutch people avoiding the city centre of our capital like the plague.
