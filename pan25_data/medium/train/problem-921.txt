There IS something worse than CPAC -- it's the "America First PAC" which is a white nationalist club founded by human turd Nick Fuentes and enthusiastically attended by Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar.
The most extreme elements of the GOP's base have been setting the tone for years now.
Whatever hateful bullshit people like Nick Fuentes are putting out there now will be GOP dogma eventually, as GOP politicians compete with each other for the right-wing vote.
If current GOP politicians are not sufficiently extreme, then even more extreme politicians will emerge to take their place.
That seems to be the way things are going for them.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Doubtful.
Fuentes is an out-there Holocaust denier and whipped up the crowd at AFPAC into cheering and chanting "Putin Putin" "Russia Russia" I can't imagine the GOP as a whole endorsing this trash.
A few years ago it would have been considered ridiculous for someone like MTG to ascend as far as she has.
And now, here we are.
She's what passes for "mainstream" among GOP politicians now.
An open insurrectionist occupies a position of significant authority and responsibility.
Someone who unironically calls for the breakup of the United States is helping to run the United States.
It's absurd.
There's no limit to how far these folks will go to win and maintain power, and no floor on how low they will sink.
