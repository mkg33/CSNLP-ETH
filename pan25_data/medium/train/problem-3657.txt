> On November 15, 2022, another massive shelling of the entire territory of Ukraine and its critical infrastructure, conducted by the armed forces of the Russian Federation, took place for many hours.
At 15:40 in the village of Przewodów in the Hrubieszów poviat in the Lubelskie Voivodeship, a Russian-made missile fell, resulting in the death of two citizens of the Republic of Poland.
In connection with this event, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prof. Zbigniew Rau summoned the ambassador of the Russian Federation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and demanded immediate detailed explanations.
It will be impossible to make that objective determination unless Russia owns the attack.
The truth likely is, that it will be or not be considered intentional depending on what Poland wants it to be.
Unless Russia owns the attack, then Poland will have no choice but treat it as intentional.
There’s almost no doubt that it was accidental.
This exact situation has been one of the biggest concerns amongst the intel community for the past 9 months.
