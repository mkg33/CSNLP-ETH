Top nootropics suppliers likely have relationships with labs that are of higher quality.
There's so much commerce, espionage and shady dealings unregulated and unregulatable.
This was spun a million ways in the covid era but at its heart it's just classic patent theft but it's so widespread now that even on patent pharmaceuticals are made in chinese labs in raw form.
My on patent Rx was $25 for 2275mg but I could get 10g on chinese ecommerce platforms.
100g was like $60 and 1kg $90.
Larger quantities seemed unreasonable.
I just was testing it out.
direct comparison of samples showed it was a less pure product with a %10-15 cut of cornstarch which was crude and thus didn't pass the eye test but did indeed contain a good percentage of the active ingredient.
Like everything it was a cheap knockoff.
Why?
If the Chinese government is setting these up, what would they have to do with the loyalty of any given Chinese private citizen who doesn't work in these police stations?
In fact, seeking other citizenship would be the way to escape oversight by these police stations.
