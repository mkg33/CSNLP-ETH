Shitty corrupt politicians benefit the most from this both sides bullshit because it absolves the worst behavior our politicians have.
Pretty different when nearly everyone expects to take a vacation around this time compared to the middle of Feb with short notice conveniently planned because it was going to be cold.
Like who is looking at his criticism and going, "Yeah, Ted Cruz did an awful thing to leave during the winter storm and is a hypocrite for attacking Joe Biden but JOE BIDEN DID IT TOO!"
Like stop.
Go home, Ted Cruz, you're drunk.

Ted Cruz Cruz is a piece of shit, and he knows people do not like him.
Politicians like him benefit the most from both sides/what aboutisms.
He does this kind of thing on purpose.
He knows he is being a disingenuous hypocrite piece of shit, and that will make people dislike him.
However, he also knows this will get lots of people to just think everyone everywhere is corrupt, and that they should just throw their hands up, and give up.
