Taiwan wants to be in control.
They wouldn't trust the results if China were to do the testing.
Besides, people might test negative before departure, but positive on arrival.
It's much better to test on arrival.
It's much better to do both.
Someone who was on a plane that had 20% COVID positive passengers is likely also infected, even if the test doesn't show it yet.
In Taiwan there is also a universal mask mandate.
They dropped it for outdoors on Dec 1st, but it remains in place for indoors.
But as I said, the mask mandate - which arguably offers the best protection of all - is still in place.
They used to have mandatory quarantine for all incoming travellers, but they dropped that in October after ending their Zero COVID strategy and subsequently suffering a wave of infections that ripped through the country:
I think everyone has given up on containment and moved on to mitigation.
Even Australia gave up on it and my wife had friends living there during peak covid, going to concerts etc and saying “we don’t have covid here!” But it happened.
It’s not sustainable, but sensibility about how to exist within it is sustainable.
But actually, do they not have filters that can sift out airborne viruses and infections?
Or is that not really possible.
They were developing their own mRNA vaccines.
I guess the original plan was to wait until those are approved and have been administered to most of the population.
But it took longer than expected and Omicron was way too contagious for them to be able to stick to Zero COVID any longer, so they ripped off the band-aid.
