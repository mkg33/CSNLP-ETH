It's fine not to engage.
Glad that you are doing it respectfully.
However, you made an incorrect assumption of my knowledge.
I was a UPSC (akin to your CSS) aspirant before more than 10 years.
Since those days I have followed Pakistani politics, and geopolitics very closely.
I now work in a FAANG and stay outside India.
I have interacted with more than 20 Pakistanis out of which I was able to respectfully debate with 2 about geopolitics.
I have hired Pakistanis and I have fired one too.
One of the best managers I had was from Pakistan (he was born and brought up elsewhere through).
I mentioned these to tell you that I do not come from a biased place and, all my and my friend's hatred is only from terrorism.
Anyway, since you want to not discuss, good luck with the extremist problem.
Hope you come out of it for the sake of regional stability.
He was the leader of Pakistan during 9/11, which means he was adjacent to and tenuously involved in the US response.
He was in the news every day for years, having to balance a population that was kinda happy about 9/11, with cooperation with the US to destroy terror networks.
Not an enviable position.
