The most ironic thing about all this is the district he left thinking this new one would be safer because it's a bit bluer usually?
Dems held that seat.
He literally carpetbagged himself out of Congress for no reason.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
He deserves none.
The people hurt by his actions, Mondaire Jones, the citizens of his district, the DCCC, and every candidate he siphoned money from to try and keep the seat he decided he wanted are the ones who need sympathy.

A comfortable wealthy white guy who felt entitled to a safe seat to wield power and influence for his own gain without any consideration of the people he represented.
The DCCC deserved so much better.
His district deserved better.
And he's an excellent example of why I never donate to the national fundraising committees, DCCC, DSCC etc.
I donate to individuals.
