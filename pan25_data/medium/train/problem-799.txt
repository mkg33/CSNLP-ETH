Why is it that when we took the house in 2018, they made it sound like we were toothless?
"Look at all these things we can pass that won't go into law cuz we don't have the senate ."
and then when we DID get the senate, fuckin Manchin and Sinema kept us from getting anything done cuz they were ghouls anyway, but now that Republicans have the house again they have the wheel?
WELL WHICH IS IT?
