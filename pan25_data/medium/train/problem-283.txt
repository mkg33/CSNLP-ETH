Give Trump credit for being in DC and trying to get the National Guard to aid him on marching on the Capitol WHILE they were in session.

The January 6th insurrection was one door and half a dozen of secret service agents away from catching the entirety of Congress defenseless.
Granted, if they managed that the aftermath would have made January 6 itself look like the barely flammable spark that set off a powder keg, and I doubt they could have actually held to power outside of a few weeks of fantasy and marauding through Washinon DC.
However, instead of a blip barely more violent than the average shouting matches and brawls, in the otherwise ordinary so called democratic process.
It could have literally been a traumatising event, some kind of inverted Paris Commune.
