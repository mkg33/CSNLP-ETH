EDIT: what a horrible headline, once you actually read the article it's about how some airlines/private airplanes should be required to use sustainable airplane fuel, which is more reasonable, but still stupid.
Nah, if they want to go after the rich they'd jack up landing fees on private aviation or increase taxes on long-haul premium cabin commercial fares.
That doesn't hit the rich then, just people who buy fancy airplane tickets of any sort.
Which is certainly probably a ton of overlap but stupidly over complex.
It also hits people that save up and splurge on nice airfare despite not being rich, and doesn't hit rich people that just travel economy or economy+ or whatever.
And the carbon footprint for flying private or flying in first class is higher than economy.
So, higher taxes.
If you're rich enough to buy a long haul business class ticket, you are almost certainly in the top few percent of the world's population in terms of wealth.
You're both rich AND impacting the environment.
I use miles for J/F flights often.
I've paid the taxes to/from the UK.
It's expensive but I get the rationale.
I'm saying that the incidence of the proposed tax in the OP is not only on the rich nor only on polluters, at least not nearly as cleanly as a carbon tax would be.
