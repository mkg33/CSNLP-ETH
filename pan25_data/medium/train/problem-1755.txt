The day I set up my account (deleted back when Twitter confirmed they were going for the deal) was the day I realized two things: First, an album I'd downloaded years before was slightly corrupted.
Second, the album was no longer available from the service I got it from.
I tracked the composer to Twitter, asked about getting new, clean versions, and succeeded.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
There was a significant value at some point.
Easy and open communication with creators, with emergency services, with political stuff, tons of porn...
