Pretty cheap as compared to waiting for numb nuts Putin to start a bigger war.
Frigging Ukrainianians have kicked his ass w zero need for outside soldiers, I’d rather kick in a few dollars and gear than mobilize the us army The Russian bluff of having a powerful army is toast, of course he still has nukes but u have to wonder if they can even launch.
Ukraine w zero navy has even stomped the Black Sea “fleet”.
Crazy.
Yeah.
Not to mention the vast majority of the military-industrial complex's corruption is out in the open.
I mean, in the United States it's legal for transnational corporations to give money directly to elected officials for political purposes, as long as everybody files the right paperwork with the FEC.
And egregious criminal behaviour often does get prosecuted.
I don't see a strong argument that the US government is any softer on corruption at Lockheed or General Dynamics than they are on the big Wall Street banks or any other major industry in the US that's rolling in easy money.
