So they switched from clear cutting to very carefully regulating when and where lumber in Canada is being cut down.
Typically to prevent huge multimillion dollar forest fires.
By cutting down trees and then replanting them responsibly we are able to have a renewable resource.
When trees aren’t managed carefully we end up with huge uncontrollable wildfires spitting co2 and smoke into the atmosphere.
an easy solution would be allow exemptions for countries that have responsible industry and have laws in place that are enforced to prevent the type of thing we are seeing in Brazil where the government is unable to or unwilling to prevent huge swaths of rainforest from being removed.
Lol we still clear cut everywhere, and we replant with only commercial timber species in mostly monoculture plantations.
Cutting down mixed wood in clear cuts (which is still the norm in every province) and planting a bunch of pine/spruce sustainable?This system has contributed greatly to the erosion of biodiversity and is likely contributing to wildfires by making our forests vulnerable to pests and diseases.
Yeah, really only private woodlots (which are becoming a thing of the past, thanks Irving) do selective harvesting and the vast majority of Canada does clearcut logging where everything including non-commercial timber species is clear cut, then they drag everything up to the roadside and what isn’t sellable timber gets burned in large oxygen-starved fires.
I’ve done forestry work in three provinces, ON, BC, and NB.
Don’t let anybody tell you Canada has a sustainable forestry industry.
