That comment just made black nail polish appear on my fingers and my hair went from blonde to black.
I think I just heard a raven tap tap tapping at my bedroom door.
Wooden grave markers can last longer than a century.
If there was any use of wooden grave markers, then at the very least you'd have remnants.
It's odd theres no documentation of plots, or stone markers at any of these locations, as if they were never meant to be discovered.
Also many of these locations are being searched under the direction of survivors.
I wonder why would the government and or churches not have documentation of these sites if they were responsible for the administration and care of the children.
When one child dies in custody it's a tragedy, but when you have multiple children at multiple sites dying is that not suspicious?
I do not know what is there, or what those 2000 hits are, but I do think that this headline risks getting ahead of itself and being sensationalist.
Sensationalist like the first time where the geologist said that one of the possibilities of the anomalies was grave and then the media blew it up to a nationwide story before finding out there were no graves?
as it was, the people responsible for that previous press release just looked like amateurs, and the people putting out this headlines today may be following in their footsteps.
