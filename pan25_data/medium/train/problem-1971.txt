This is why we need progressive property taxes.
The more residential properties you own, the higher marginal property tax rates you should pay.
Lower the property taxes on single home owners, give subsidies to first-time home owner-builders, and everyone with more than two residential properties gets taxed at a progressive rate.
This will help reduce mega-landlords and price fixing with rents and encourage individual home ownership.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

A more lefty solution would be that metro-area properties that sit unoccupied for more than a few months get added to a pool of public housing that can be used to house homeless, and the state will give the property owner a moderate stipend for doing so.
Watch how fast rents will come down when property owners might be forced to let homeless sleep there.
