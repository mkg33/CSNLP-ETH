That'll never happen because India doesn't see itself as needing Western backing against China.
The two countries are both nuclear armed and will never go to open war with each other.
They'll experience exponential growth even without direct Western political backing.
Really the only thing standing in their way is themselves, in the form of their Hindu hardliners like Modi that prioritize power and authoritarianism over economic growth.
Honestly I forsee India continuing to be a growing thorn in the side of Western foreign policy in the Indo-Pacific.
I’m not sure I’d want a NATO style agreement with India due to their tumultuous relationship with both Pakistan and China.
Also, I just don't see India joining up.
Despite what the UK is saying, India is not an ally to the west.
It has always loudly proclaimed itself a non-aligned nation.
At best it would be a situation like Turkey, where they get membership because of geopolitical importance, but don't really give a crap about the interests of their allies.
