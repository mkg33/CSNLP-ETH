My brother is an engineer, always on call.
He’s off long enough to sleep then constantly having to check the board for his next call out.
He has 18 years in and all he does is worry about being available.
His sleep patterns are so unhealthy.
My brother works for the railroad.
Railroad companies, like most, are making record profits.
There is absolutely no reason workers shouldn’t have paid sick time, none.
Rail workers are treated like total shit and our economy would crash without them.
I hope they strike.
Yes I know the cost, but so does everyone else and they don’t seem to care.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
