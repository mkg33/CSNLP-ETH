No, the culture of western europe has successfully mitigated a lot of the christian shit during the 1900-2020s.
It is still bad but islamic customs and culture is worse and is enablimg the shittier christians to be worse.
Also, even if it were true that the religions were equally bad, so what.
Two bad doesnt make one right.
Mate I’m probably up there with most anti-religious person on this site but this is the dumbest far fetched take there is.
No one in Switzerland is voting to make a religious garb mandatory.
It’s not unknowable.
It’s obvious.
Switzerland is not a Muslim country and will never be majority.
Theocracies need a majority or a power base and they have neither there.
My local pool had a "No street clothing" rule.
meaning t-shirts and cutoff jeans, regular shorts etc, weren't allowed in the pool.
This rule would at least address one issue.
Personally?
I don't care.
Because it is not merely a choice of fashion.
It is catering to the sexist bodyphobia of the islamic cultures and normalises body shaming.
