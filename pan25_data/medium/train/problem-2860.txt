And it can hardly turn anybody against your cause when there is nobody for your cause in the general public.
inb4 I am getting pointed to all the people who pay lip service without being willing to sacrifice a single tiny thing.
Ive sacrificed everything to live with as small a carbon footprint as possible and you're right, im completely alone.
Humanity is a selfish, stupid, and suicidal creature.
Enjoy your last years.
The climate belongs to no one.
It is not a cause and the fact you think it is means that the message is not getting through.
We've triggered our own extinction.
We've fueled weather our infrastructure cannot stand up to.
We are years away from losing everything, including all the species we ostensibly care about based on the reaction every time a poacher gets killed.
If you think it's a "cause", you have no idea what's going on in your own reality.
I couldn't give a damn about extinction rebellion and find them annoying, myself, but we've triggered an extinction that we will be a part of.
Unless you're dying of something else, you're going to die from something related to climate change.
Humans evolved for the climate we lived in before we changed it.
We are not adapted to the climate we're heading for and will not survive it.
Being the authors of this horrible fate for all complex life, what does any of this matter?
There won't be anyone left.
Read the data!
The fisheries are vanishing which feed all coastal biomes.
The earth is turning into sinking islands of habitable space that are also on fire.
Drawing attention to the collapse of the planet is not a cause, it's a reality the rest of us are too brainwashed to take seriously.
