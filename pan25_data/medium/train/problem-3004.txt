As bad as Qatar is, I'd say NK is at least few, if not a bunch, of steps worse.
For starters, they're still technically at war with South Korea.
Then there's the meth, so much meth everywhere.
Not last and not least but last I'll list is of course the incredibly outrageous humans rights violations.
Don't get me wrong, fuck this world cup and fuck qatar, but I think NK would take the cake.
I'm sure there's millions of political activists who'd just love to flood into NK and start talking shit about their government while the cameras are rolling.
On the other hand, there's no way NK would let a million foreign fans and the world's media run rampant in their country.
If they tried to ban or control outside spectators FIFA would probably face a reckoning for even the suggestion of banning foreign spectators.
No, the actual live event would only be seen by a privelaged few and people the regime was sure of.
But a heavily edited version of it with propaganda narration would be playing somewhere in North Korea every day for decades.
