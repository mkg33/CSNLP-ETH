Pence is such a liar!
Doesn't he know it's a sin?
He lied and lied, on a Sunday no less, in his Meet the Press interview.
The biggest whopper is that democrats want abortion on demand until birth.
Democrats want Roe, or a similar viability standard based on biology and not theology.
Roe is not abortion on demand until birth.
Roe resulted in a 20 week viability standard.
So Pence is a liar trying to enrage over a lie.
Guess he learned well from Trump.
