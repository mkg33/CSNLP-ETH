Fortunately for Ukraine, Poland is west now too.
We- Slavic people have THE MOST experience of fighting against regimes, occupants and terror states in the world.
It's centuries long tradition of surviving in a geopolitical location where a country shouldn't exist, yet our culture is strong and our will and love of living free is stronger than ever.
With this said we are not afraid of Russian terror, we are not afraid of helping Ukraine and we are no longer weak, torn apart country which we were after ww1 and which Germany used in '39 before we could spread our wings.
Germany can hesitate, but it won't stop us helping them, won't stop us lobbying and asking US to continue and increase help.
All that Germany achieves is breaking down NATO which is again Putin's win.
CONGRATULATIONS DEAR 'WESTERN VALUES'.

They purchased a large portion from Russia because it was the cheapest.
But due to the fact that Germany massively increased the amount of renewable energy, the total reliance actually shrunk as the reliance on fossil fuels shrunk by 50%.
