Putin had every intention of bringing Germany to its knees by turning off the power in the dead of winter, part of his plan to reunite the eastern block and then some under his rule, which he initiated in 2014 with the initial invasion of Ukraine.
Edit: I'm not providing links because you can look up the DSM and ICD easily using the information in the post, while the rest isn't something I have a single direct summary of - the best I can recommend is that you search "psychopathy vs sociopathy" and see how many different definitions you can find in the first few pages.
The ones that define them differently pretty much all state their definitions, because there is no distinction widely enough accepted for them to know what readers will think otherwise.
A couple of common ones are: psychopaths are born that way, but sociopaths are made that way by their environment; psychopaths don't know right from wrong, sociopaths know but don't care; sociopaths are like Sherlock from the BBC adaptation and psychopaths are like Moriarty.
