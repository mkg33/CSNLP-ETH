Funny the way you described is exactly how each and every non-colonial power industrialized.
The US incentivized entrepreneurs who stole cotton mill designs from the UK, Japan and South Korea did the same for cars and appliances and were accused of making cheap knock-offs in the 70s and 80s.
Ditto Taiwan with its semiconductor industry and methodical plans to monopolize fab know-how.
Made in Germany was originally a mandatory seal to designate inferior product quality.
The Soviets stole from Europe and Americaâ€¦ In fact, I cannot name a single country who did not follow this path.
And to forestall the knee jerk argument that those were before intellectual property laws were widely recognized, that is not true, certainly not for Japan/SK/Taiwan, and the concept of IP as a tool for protectionism long predated the establishment of sovereign patent offices and the WIPO.
China really ruined their own chances by stealing everything they could from the west and producing shit knock offs instead of innovating on their own.
The US is the sole reason why China is the powerhouse it is today and instead of working together, they stab the US in the back every chance they get.
And that's not even touching on the fact that their current regime is perfectly fine disappearing citizens who speak out, slave labor, and literal concentration camps for people they don't like.
Even right now they're drooling at the thought of invading Taiwan and stealing the machines used to produce semiconductors because they're incapable of producing them on their own.
