> More than 2,100 criminal proceedings have been initiated for falsification of documents, illegal transport of persons, and draft evasion.
Charges have resulted against 950 people, and more than 350 have been held criminally liable.
The service said the bodies of 12 people who drowned had been found along river sections of the Ukrainian-Romanian border.
Three other bodies were found in the mountains.
I'm in the US but for whatever reason they do a draft, I'm going straight to the air force.
My uncle in Vietnam dif that.
Didn't like his odds with the lottery so joined the air force.
2 weeks after joining got the draft notice.
Still went to Vietnam but was just an engineer working on planes rather than the frontlines.
When it comes to conscription you usually don't get a choice.
You get graded based on your background and physical health like a piece of meat and assigned where they need people.
In a situation where the conflict is an infantry meat grinder the odds are high you'll be going to the front lines unless you have some advanced and militarily useful education or trade skills.
I am not spinning the dice enrolling in shit hoping for a chance to avoid combat in a conflict I have decided I have no interest in fighting in.
I damn well know if they need replacement bodies up on the front badly enough I'll eventually end up there.
That's what id do.
Choose the branch that basically has not frontline fighters and if they do are super skilled and most people won't be able to do it.
IE air force.
The thing is everyone is going to want to get into the air force because they know its less likely they'll be involved in ground engagements.
That is true today even outside of a draft.
The military will need a large number of bodies in the army though and operational needs will come first.
So the people with the most useful skillsets will get the air force and almost everyone else is going to the army.
