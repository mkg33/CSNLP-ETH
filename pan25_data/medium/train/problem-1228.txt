The article featured a doozy of a story from 1996, when the Association to Benefit Children held a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new nursery school serving children with AIDS.
A variety of major New York figures and donors were on hand, including Donald Trump.The trouble, as it turns out, is that Trump hadn't been invited.
He simply showed up unannounced, walked onto the stage, took a seat -- a seat, as Farenthold reported, that had been assigned to a developer who had given generously to build the nursery -- and smiled for the photographers.
He was even seen dancing the Macarena.Trump hadn't contributed a dime to the Association to Benefit Children.
In fact, after the event, Trump "left without offering an explanation," and never wrote a check to benefit the charity.While it may seem crude to put it in these terms, according to the Post's reporting, Donald Trump effectively crashed a charity event -- for a nursery school helping children with AIDS -- in order to give people the false impression that he'd done something nice for those kids.
