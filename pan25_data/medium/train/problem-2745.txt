I would agree with that.
I think most of these politicians don’t really believe in what they say, just what in will get them votes.
Both sides do it, and we deserve better.
When Dems controlled the house and senate, they knew SCOTUS was gonna overturn Roe V Wade because of the leak, and they had the votes to send nationally legal abortion to Biden’s desk, and they didn’t.
Likewise, when Republicans controlled the senate and house, they could have rammed through some national laws that loosened gun laws, or anything else they campaigned on, but again they didn’t.
These people suck, and will only lift their fingers enough to get votes and line their own pockets.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
