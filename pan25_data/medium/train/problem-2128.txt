(I’m aware that Washinon held slaves.
Hundreds of them.
God awful, and there were abolitionists at the time so he can’t claim ‘well I had no idea slavery was bad’, and the Southern landowners only wanted independence when King George III announced his intent to end slavery throughout the British Empire, so yes Washinon was a complete asshole BUT for two singular actions: Washinon could’ve been king and instead he gave the modern world a functional democratic republic including the peaceful transfer of power, after first determining to never give up in the long war for independence where he was truly the keystone of the Continental Army, so he cannot be underestimated as the founding-est of fathers of the United States.
