The national age of consent is 13, any intercourse between an adult and a person under that age are illegal.
Every prefecture has also passed some kind of higher age restriction, but those restrictions can be a lot weaker than "no intercourse, period", and also rarely have the same penalty as violating the national law.
In particular, multiple prefectures have an age of consent set to 18 unless a marriage or promise of marriage exists, and that promise can be made informally or after the fact.
Furthermore, the penalties for violating that law often don't extend to significant jailtime.
That means that if you're being abused by a 40 year old who tells you "Tell the cops we plan to get married", and you don't go along with it, they might get convicted, but in 6 to 12 months they can be back on the street and looking for revenge.
That's a terrifying thought at any age, but especially when you're 13.
Sometimes there's no jailtime at all, even when the victim is 13, just fines and suspended sentences.
Now, realistically, the impact is going to be limited, given that IIRC most or all prefectures have this set at 16 or 18 anyway, with japanese (federal?
is that how you'd phrase it) law previously only stating it couldn't be lower than what it set).
