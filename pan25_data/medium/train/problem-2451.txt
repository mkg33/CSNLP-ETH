Interesting!
I was in Thailand around the end of March and remember the sunsets there were oddly red, like the sun was dark red an hour or so before it actually set.
You could look right at the sun without your eyes hurting.
I wonder if the eruption contributed to that even though it was so far away.
It was also the crop burning season there so that may have been why as well, or maybe a combination of both?
Either way I'm in Vietnam now and the sunsets are not like that anymore.
You gotta get one of those tubes of ice from the Antarctic core and attach it to your wrist like a watch.
Then you can laugh at all the digital scientist when talking about the timeline and smugly say "I prefer analogue" and point to your (likely melting) (likely ridiculously long) tube.
Four hundred thousand years ago last Tuesday at about 3:56 PM EST.
It was about 21 degrees at the time, and History (the man who decided to write everything down) was quite full of a breakfast consisting of ye old food.
You can also say things when asked about the time.
"It's half past the Cambrian explosion" "Hmrah hmrah hmrah".
>Volcanic eruptions in the past likely produced higher plumes but occurred before scientists were able to make such measurements.
