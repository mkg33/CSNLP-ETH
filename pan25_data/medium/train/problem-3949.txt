Am I reading this correctly and the judge ordered this part released to show everyone that the grand jury believed that one or more people lied to them under oath?
Why do this?
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
First, the final report of special grand juries are not technically secret in Georgia, but there is not a specific period of time in which they have to be released.
Second, a number of press organizations have requested to see the report, so the judge is trying to balance the needs of the DA, who is taking the report and using it for a criminal grand jury and the rights of the people to know what the special grand jury found.
The grand jury believes one or more witnesses may have perjured themselves during their testimony, and recommend indictment for those suspected.
