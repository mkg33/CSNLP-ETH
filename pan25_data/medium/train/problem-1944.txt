Support of the GOP = Support of people just like the shooter AND his family, where he learned this hatred and fear of “other” that rules their every action and though and plan.
This dude is a hero, but his life is about to get miserable from the right.
Guarantee he and his family are already receiving death threats.
Popular right wing figures are already starting with “why would a veteran take his family to a drag show.”.
It’s so disgusting.
Not that literally anyone needs to justify attending a drag show, but I watched his (brutally hard to watch) interview with CNN.
He explained his daughter’s friend was performing at the show and the family went to be supportive.
And his daughter’s lonime boyfriend is one of the deceased and it has really fucked him up that he couldn’t save him.
So not only is this man a soldier (who Republicans claim to “love and support”), but also clearly a tremendous family man.
And he’s going to get dragged through the mud for however long Republican’s attention spans last because he doesn’t fit into their horrible culture war that caused this in the first place.
He even said that Joshua Thurman, a fellow club patron who was dancing with Fierro’s family, this Joshua immediately grabbed the hand of Fierro’s daughter and took her to hide.
Joshua Thurman is brave, loving person - as I’d say of any who were at the Club that night (or anywhere, any day or hour) for a fun time surrounded by love and joy and filling a human need for companionship and camaraderie with like minded people.
