You, and many others as the links show, are not even aware that the commissioners are indeed chosen democratically in a way to make populists like yourself not freak out with the EU becoming a “federal superstate”.
Commissioners are sent to Brussels by state governments, 1 for each country, in consultation with the president of the commission who is elected by the Council and approved by the parliament.
The parliament can also scrap the entire commission if they don’t agree with a single person being appointed.
I saw a lot of comments and even articles about how Europe should shut up for teaching other countries about corruption.
But I thinks this is best what can happen and should be used as example for other places.
There always might be someone that gets corrupted and laws like Europe have keeps these these people accountable.
What good is teaching other countries about corruption if your anti corruption agencies are just for show?
It’s inevitable the someone in politics will take bribes.
Even in the least corrupt countries.
Displaying the due process for all is perhaps the biggest demonstration they can do.
