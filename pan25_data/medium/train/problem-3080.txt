If you find a bee which is too cold and lethargic to get home you can give the bee a little bit of room temperature sugar water (don't use hot water!)
to give the bee some energy.
Mix some up in a cup, scoop some up on a spoon and put that near the bee so it can have a good feed.
I think calling them bee-toxic pesticides is misleading.
They're insecticides, they were designed to kill all bugs.
The companies that make them were fully aware that putting these chemicals in the environment would be problematic.
They also produce new chemicals much faster than EU can ever ban them.
We keep reading about bees but that's distracting us from the fact that all insects are rapidly declining everywhere.
Why are new chemicals considered safe until proven otherwise?
Shouldn't it be the other way around?
as an anecdote.
My father told me that when he was young that it was very common for drivers to stop and clean the windshield from insects.
Now it is even uncommon to hit one insect during one or several trips.
