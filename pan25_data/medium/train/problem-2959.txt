Yeah I saw a pic of an elderly couple selling a dead child, head an all, as food.
Humanity is 10 missed meals away from anarchy.
We are animals, literally.
The number of Russian lives being thrown into the meat grinder, for basically no reason, is incomprehensible.
You know with racism how we should be judging people based upon their actions rather than stereotypes, you’re doing the exact same with people on something else they can’t change.
Lol, I'm not a boomer, but I have there mind set Freedom, no tyrants, no ea ting and Ra ping our children Stand up against those who do such things at ALL costs The boomers laid out the ground for your easy life They worked and sacrificed for what YOU are giving away!
Now, what I want to know more than anything, is at what point is the scale of casualties just impossible to hide anymore?
It looked like a small operation, but was successful.
They are practicing on a small scale for a similar attack on Crimea.
They take Crimea instead of simply cutting it off, and they can use it as a base for HIMARS and S-300.
You can pay your soldiers, but most of them probably realize they won't live to spend it, even if there was anything to buy.
All that money is kind of useless, though.
The only thing they can use it for is buying weapons, and the rubels are only good for buying oil.
And the price is only going to go down.
That money is going to be worthless, why even bother at this point?
Who are they planning on paying in roubles?
What are they expecting to get in return?
I can't imagine that any soldier on the front lines already is expecting to get paid at this point.
They are not being motivated by money, only fear.
