I went down an internet rabbit hole one weekend reading scans of WW2 and interwar era US naval and army cooking and supply procedures.
The military learned a lot about the power of logistics in WW1 (and to some extent as far back as the US civil war and Napoleon's campaigns).
The advanced planning that was put into how to simply and easily pre-calculate the food, equipment, and manpower to efficiently and effectively keep thousands of men properly fed while on the move played a major and underappreciated role in the effectiveness of the US being able to successfully fight a 2 front war.
Even in manuals geared for a naval line cook, the importance of stock rotation, balanced nutrition, and advance planning to ensure supplies would be used in the most optimal order.
Even such things as enduring that recipes look appealing, have regular variety, and "provide the mental and emotional comforts of a quality meal" were stressed at all levels.
It's okay brother, we needed to go through this phase to shake off the last of our post-colonial superiority complex.
A few more disastrous economic events and very cold winters and this country will beg to be let back in under the Swiss/Norwegian model.
Unable to pump the brakes on the European project but still beholden to their (pro-consumer) laws.
