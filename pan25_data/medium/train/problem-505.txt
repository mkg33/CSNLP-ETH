The longer they wait before they can take action, the less people they will have to do it with because they'll be stuffed into the conscript meatgrinder.
Whatever came afterwards, at least the Revolution got the Russian people out of the meatgrinder of an unwinnable war, that their despotic leader had forced them into.
Reddit Revolutionaries love romanticizing communist propaganda but simply refuse to accept that the propaganda was just bullshit, the revolutions resulted in a lot of people being murdered by the state or starved and a couple of generations later its just capitalism in a more authoritarian state.
The same people who cheekily share communist propaganda can't name a point in history where communism actually delivered on its promises.
Then have the stones to say "We'll we've never really tried it, maybe it'll work when we do it!
".
I like to Google street view while I eat lunch.
Just pick some random spot on earth and look at the everyday scenes of a foreign country.
What I find weird about Russia is that you pick any random place and a) it looks dilapidated and b) there's random people walking along some pretty major roads.
I started looking around Khasan (NK border) but I noticed it wherever I click in the country.
Yes I know that it's a common joke that all places look the same in Russia (they made a rom com about it - The Irony of Fate) but they all look depressingly the same.
Huge pot holes in the parking lot, a sad little playground, babushkas walking with groceries, all enclosed by gray concrete high rises with the "sunroom" balcony with single pane glass that make you feel the draft just by looking at them.
In the end, it's always the same energy as fascists, people who are willing to band together and sacrifice others for the hope of personally benefiting.
