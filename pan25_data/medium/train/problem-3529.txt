I got into the Omicron trial and they were conducting mRNA flu shot trials too, but I wasn't eligible since I was in another trial.
is a globally used registration platform that is used for public disclosure of human-phase research where an 'intervention' is used.
OP is wrong to assume it's just useful for US citizens.
There are other platforms, though: ANZCTR, ISRCTN, EU Clinical Trials Register etc.
The WHO's ICTRP aggregates all trial registrations across multiple platforms.
I now work in disability, specifically in neuro disability though and I have to say I won the neuro lottery with the fact that I recovered.
Lived experience with the hard core nature of GBS though makes me better at my job.
Edit: I stand corrected.
Thanks to another redditor for pointing out that this IS a global listing of trials, despite being a US Government site.
To be clear though - this is not designed as a recruitment platform.
You can certainly contact the coordinators of project team through the contact information provided, but it's not what a trial registry is there for.
Since GBS I've had everything else, measles boosters, tetanus shots, chicken pox, a huge list because I worked in a hospital.
The only one I missed was the flu.
The risk with the flu vaccine is that they use eggs in the making of.
There's a protein that exists in the gut of a chicken that uncooked can trigger GBS in those with a genetic predisposition at an incredibly high rate.
