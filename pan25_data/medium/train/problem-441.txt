I was indecisive this election on a few offices and waited to make sure I didn’t want to surrender my ballot and change a selection or two.
This will be the last time I vote by mail, though.
Mailed on Election Day, Clark County didn’t confirm receipt, and there’s nothing I can do about it now.
Well, seeing as that’s the last day the county permits sending a ballot, why shouldn’t I trust that they will process it on time?
They had until the 12th, and it was mailed on the 8th.
