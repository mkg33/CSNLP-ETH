EDIT: Later in the article it says that he donated Trump Spring water which is currently still being bottled.
Trump Ice is what was discontinued in 2010.
So we don’t know exactly what the grift is yet.
But there’s sure to be one.
Oh dude... that's... no.
I mean it won't technically go bad, but probably also won't taste quite right.
Those bottles are porous and water stored in them too long can pick up some funky flavors.
Not to mention the plastic breakdown.
Yeah.
I had a 4-year-old bottle of water once, too when I went camping a few years back.
It was a bottle of water in the trunk.
But not one of the ones we recently packed.
I took it after we unloaded everything and meant to have it to drink while on the trail on the way to the camp site.
Just tasted like plastic and almost like dust.
I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth for hours.
