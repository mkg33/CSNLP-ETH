Let's not forget that they also sold monthly tickets for 9â‚¬ for two months (or was it 3?).
The trains were absolutely packed, because everyone used the cheap transportation for travel, holidays on the coast and weekend trips.
It's awesome ngl.
That is true, although the Deutsche Bahn has a ffp2 mask rule.
People who don't wear one or one that is not up to ffp2 standard have to leave the train.
Although I'm not sure if it can prevent every infection, I think it still lowers the numbers significantly.
All of those strategies will pay dividends in the future, because the more people use public transportation instead of their private cars, the better air quality and the less traffic jams we're going to experience.
What's more, the level of service Germans receive is going to increase dramatically over time since more funds will be pumped into train and bus infrastructure.
Honestly, I'm shocked by how few European countries mimic this approach.
I'd be satisfied if the Polish government decided to enact such laws, instead of printing more money with more welfare programs in mind.
