Yeah, Haiti damn near has every single problem a civilization can have all at the same time.
You name it, Haiti has that problem.
At a certain point it needs to be acknowledged that a rotten old house is too far gone and just need to be condemned and rebuilt from scratch.

The amount of force necessary to bring an entire country back into order is unimaginable.
Given all those issues, it seems essentially impossible for foreign governments to make any useful inroads without setting up a de facto Occupational Government.
Covid, cholera, presidential assassination, soil erosion, food and energy shortages, drinkable water shortages, gang violence, corruption, crumbling infrastructure and healthcare systems, police brutality, earthquakes, tropical storms, illiteracy, brain drain, abductions, complete inability to hold elections or form a government, LGBT discrimination, investment collapse and currency depreciation, uncontrolled inflation, and the list goes on and on and on.
