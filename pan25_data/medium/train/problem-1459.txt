Well global warming isn’t the same as climate change.
Climate change is the change of local and regional average weather patterns.
Which directly affects locals, for example in the United States: Texas residents who have battled both droughts and deathly heatwaves as well as frigid winter storms in the same year.
It's incredible how many people are still denying climate change while its effects are now clearly visible.
I got in a huge fight with my grampa on New Years because he refused to admit that climate change was really severe, or that it was caused by humans.
"The people you read say that.
The people I read say otherwise."
He said.
As if the overwhelming general consensus between scientist and the bullshit spout by political commentators in far-right channels had the same fucking weight.
Meanwhile, my climate change denying mother who gardens religiously keeps complaining about how it’s hotter than it used to be and the “weather is being crazier with its mood swings lately.”.
She says she’s distancing from Fox News and more of an “independent” but her news sources are still tabloid, she thinks the Daily Mail must be great because it’s UK based.
