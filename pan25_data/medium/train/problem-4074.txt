And it's an improvement over the lightning cable so what is your point?
Apple purposely makes people spend more and they still love and defend them because they have good marketing?
Apple said they wanted to use lightning for ten years.
They also have cables that are USB-C to Lightning which is slightly easier, in addition to several devices solely using USB-C: there’s a financial incentive there but I don’t think it’s as large as people make it out to be.
And I’m sure Apple was hesitant to make people switch to yet another connector so soon after buying new cables and accessories for Lightning.
Ok now we’re just being silly lol why would apple switch from Lightning to anything but USB-C?
Lightning was way better than anything else available until USB-C came around.
No, Apple was hesitant because it was a universal connector and not their own.
They could care less about people having to buy new cables and accessories (if they did, they'd make those cables last longer - no oem cable is made crappier than Apple).
