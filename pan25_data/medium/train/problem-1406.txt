I'm pretty damn progressive and technocratic, and while I support the idea of policy that enables people to have kids and fulfilling lives with them, this ain't it.
Mandated sick days, better wages and hours for average workers, Healthcare that isn't tied to a job, affordable home prices and food staples, those are all things that can foster better environments for people to have kids.
Taking money from people who don't want, can't have, or trally cant afford kids, and giving it to people who do have kids, is bad policy.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

But boy could better policy be crafted.
