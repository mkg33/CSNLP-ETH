Its a great way for Trump to endlessly keep running his grift, extracting money from gullible MAGA sheep buying his Chinese campaign merch and sending him donations to keep running.
People seem to forget that this is the only reason he got the nomination in 2016.
They didn't want him but he was threatening to start his own party which they knew would tank them, to they folded and gave him what he wanted.
Let's see what they do this time.
I think this is the plan.
The midterms was a last ditch effort for the GOP to embrace him.
It backfired.
Trump is a vengeful idiot.
He’ll create a 3rd party just to pull a “see what I did there”, and get even.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
And unlike 2016 with no danger of actually being the dog that caught the car and winning the election.
