Yes, I love how Boehner and Ryan are coming out now like "We knew Trump was bad" hoping people forget they fostered and nurtured the nutjob caucus that turned into Q-MAGA and is holding their party hostage.
100% agree, been saying this since he left office.
He's setting himself up to be the anti-Trump, middle of the road conservative in '24.
Who else is there?
Desantis is too extreme (like Trump), poll after poll shows people want a younger candidate...Ryan/Biden could be dangerous for the left, and if there is a candidate on the right that scares the Dems enough to primary hard on Biden, how good does he look in his 80's coming out of that?
