Small Diameter Bombs are precision guided glider bombs usually dropped from planes.
The US has huge stocks of them.
However they cant be sent to Ukraine as 1.
Ukraine has no air superiority and 2.
They arent compatible with ex soviet planes.
So instead of dropping them from a plane they found a way to launch it from the ground.
So what they did instead is find a way to launch them from the ground using existing stocks of weapons no longer used.
The HIMARS and M270MRLS used to fire unguided cluster rockets, these arent used anymore.
So they took the rocket booster of old cluster rockets, put it on a SDB and voilla.
You have a guided long range glider bomb launched from the ground using existing stocks and compatible with HIMARS and M270 systems that are already in Ukraine.
The Western MIC has been increasingly smart in weapons like this.
Why make a while new guided bomb if we can just make a screw on Kit for existing stocks of dumb bombs a.k.a.
the JDAM.
Why make guided missiles if we can just make a screw on guidance kit for our existing stocks of Dumb rockets a.k.a APKSW.
Fortunately, the rockets being longer range means they can hit the same targets even if Russia somehow pushes Ukraine back any significant distance from here.
