Nothing depresses wages worse than competing with illegal immigrants working for two dollars an hour.
They'd prefer citizenship and so would every American applying for the same jobs they are.
Only the businesses knowingly hiring illegal immigrants get any benefit at all from our current border situation - which is probably why it hasn't meaningfully changed in decades.
Honestly the more I think about it the more I'm convinced that... in general... if these people were the type to be drug dealers and horrible folks, they'd probably have an easier time getting in by having the support of cartel and pushers.
I had never thought about that being a thing before... but to me it makes sense.
In general, be courteous to others.
