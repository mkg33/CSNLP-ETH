In the early 2000's my car got stolen in Tampa and a policeman gave me a ride to where they found the car.
My Dad owned a small business in downtown Jacksonville so I had seen some bad neighborhoods but this neighborhood in Tampa was on a whole different level.
There there was a random barrel on fire, people were openly doing hard drugs, the ditches were clogged with garbage, it looked like a movie set of a bad neighborhood.
Luckily the policeman gave me a gallon of gas from a can in his trunk and screwdriver to start the car.
He waited until my car started and then escorted me back to the interstate.
