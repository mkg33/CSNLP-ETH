Yeah but what's feminine "enough"?
This seems like terrorist control territory where they can say women must wear dresses so they can easily tell if you're trans or not.
The entire point of bigoted laws is to target a vulnerable minority so they can enact authoritative laws on everyone, and Bigots will ignore it because they aren't trans or even are for it because they hate trans people, never realizing that trans rights are the same as everyone else's rights, because they don't get how having rights works.
(Because they actually don't want them they just assume no one will enforce the negative thing against themselves).
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
