I don’t know about that.
The highest paid person in LA’s homelessness services is paid 300k (which is a lot) but then 2nd hugest is 220 and goes down drastically from there.
Directors are paid around 150 (which is very little for what it takes to get there) and regular field people are making peanuts.
The nice thing is with government jobs everyone’s salary is public knowledge so you don’t have to take the word of a random instagram account you can just look it up.
