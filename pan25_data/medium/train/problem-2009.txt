You ok bro?
As a "pro Ukraine Republican", proud to be American, and stand up/humble citizen, none of this overgeneralized and uneducated stupidity applies to me.
Over generalizing is dangerous.
If you were to meet me, or anyone like me for that matter, chances are we would be friends and have interesting philosophical conversations even if our views differed.
Your mindset is part of the problem, republican is not a one size fits all description.
In all actuality, I hate the two party system and am probably more independent with a few more views leaning Republican.
Either way, I am sure I will get roasted on reddit for this comment but that is the beauty of freedom and i do not hate you because you may or may not be associated with a different political party.
Lots of "secret" jokes, but you can be 100% certain this would not be in the Washinon Post if the CIA did not want it to be.
They want Russians and the world to know they are helping.
It's secret while it's happening, cIA wants ruzzia to know they had the director of the CIA inside Ukraine talking to the president, and they didn't know about it.
