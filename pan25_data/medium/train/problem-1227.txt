I guess, happened two hours ago.
The embassy is scheduled to make a press release.
Who knows how it got through.
There were no casualties and the man suffered the explosion got out in his own feet and was sent to the hospital.
There was another bomb to a weapons company called Instalaza, from Zaragoza.
Weapons sent to Ukraine by Spain were manufacured there.
The newspaper is saying some type of grenade launcher.
A second bomb was sent to the Instalaza main office building (HQ?).
It was detected by security staff just before 19:00 and they phoned the police.
An unit of TEDAX was sent to check it out and they detonated the bomb safely.
The staff member from the embassy got minor burns in a finger as a little flame started when she/he tried to open the letter but went to the hospital without ambulance help.
Both places were checked by the police in case other bombs werent located yet.
It seems all good now.
All evidences and fragments have been sent to the forensics.
Blue ink was used and around 20 gr envelopes.
Definetly they were not make by the unabomber.
