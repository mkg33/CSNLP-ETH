Seoul is well within the range of the thousands of artillery lined up along the DMZ.
The death toll within the first few minutes of the war would be immense, and that's assuming an immediate defeat by rapid response troops in the area.
They aren't running short of their own prisoners and ethnic minorities yet.
A horde of malnourished North Koreans that they can't afford to equip isn't going to be much use.
I legit don't understand why Russia hasn't bought a ton of NK troops.
They have tons of food and fuel and NK cares about their citizens even less than Russia.
“Men, you're lucky men.
Soon, you'll all be fighting for your planet.
many of you will be dying for your planet.
A few of you will be put through a fine mesh screen for your planet.
They will be the luckiest of all.”.
The Russians are not winning, but that is no reason to overlook the total destruction they have been able to inflict.
Entire cities razed, and a staggering death total.
I don't think the North Koreans would win, but the casualties would be immense.
("North Korea maintains nearly 6,000 artillery systems within range of major South Korean population centers, which it could use to kill many thousands in just an hour, even without resorting to chemical or nuclear weapons.
