Well look at Chile on a map.
All they got to do is run big cables north to south and they cover their entire population.
Weird if they didn't have great internet.
Idk, my hometown is as rural as they come (forest/lake town in Oklahoma, population 300) can get 100 Mbps which is more than most homes will ever need.
Fiber right to your home isn't the end-all be-all of internet anymore.
China at number two is the truly impressive one.
Singapore at 3 is a city state so again - good job but let's not overhype it.
There's also population density in cities.
In Eastern Europe, there are a lot of communist era built apartment blocks, which are still practiced in China.
As a result, in Romania for instance, this leads to offers like 8 euro per month for 1gbit fiber.
It's ridiculously low, but so are their infrastructure costs.
We have Sonic in several parts of Northern California with 10Gb speeds.
It’s their first build-out of their own, so not available to a lot yet… but if it’s available it’s worth it and beats Comcast’s garbage internet services cost for substandard service.
