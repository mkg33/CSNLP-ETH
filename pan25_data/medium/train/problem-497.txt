Anything that keeps this going another day is another day Putin gets live, because when the music stops he knows he's a dead man.
Russian dictators don't survive losing wars.
I don't think he needs to he has his own Private army which hasn't even stepped on Ukraine.
So most likely he will have nothing to worry even if he loses the war he will just massacre anyone that tries to threaten him.
Well, nowadays the Russian situation is starting to get sticky in this way.
Technically Putin does not have a private army, this Prigozhin guy operates the Wagner group.
Who has been loyal to him up till now, but lately has criticized the Russian leadership.
I might wager a bet, that if he sees Putin weakening, he might try to move to become the next leader.
A few days ago it was announced that Gazprom just founded its own private army.
And Ramzan Kadirov has his own chechen militia who only answer to him personally.
Each of these players can attempt a coup any time, although I would not bet on Kadirov ever trying.
But the Wagner group is in a pretty good position to orchestrate a coup.
They have just been 'castrated' by the Russian government.
They cant recruit prisoners anymore and their name is censored in Russian media.
And a few weeks ago there was a rumor spread that 'Ukrainians' wanted to assassinate him.
This 'rumor' was actually a hint/warning from the Russian government not to step out of line or he will be killed.
You know what happened, when the senate, led by Pompeius ordered Caesar to come back to Rome, send his army home and forbid him of running for the consul post?
He started a civil war.
