I said nationalize after "force the owners to concede" because the owners might just say "no" to the conditions, hoping to have the government just shoot the workers for striking, in which the appropriate response would be to take the company away from them.
The govt can order the workers back to work, but it cannot supply enough trained replacements from the military should the workers refuse or quit.
The most effective thing the govt can do is to lean on the railroads to negotiate a better deal for the workers to prevent the strike.
Right, but honestly a wildcat strike is an option.
They can be fired, but staffing several major railroads seems like a pretty daunting task in this labor market.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
The can demand they not strike, but what are they going to do if the workers strike anyway?
Destroy the economy as all trains shut down?
I can only imagine the billions that would cost if that lasted for just a week.
