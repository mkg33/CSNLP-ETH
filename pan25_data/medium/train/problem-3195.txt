You are stealing: conscripted.
You are playing music too loud: conscripted, right away.
Driving too fast: conscripted.
Slow: conscripted.
You are charging too high prices for sweaters, glasses: you are conscripted.
You undercook fish?
Believe it or not, conscripted.
You overcook chicken, also conscripted.
Undercook, overcook.
You make an appointment with the dentist and you don't show up, believe it or not, conscripted, right away.
We have the best patients in the world because of conscription.
I met a Canadian once, she talked to me for a solid 30 minutes even though I just wanted to go home.
She was incredibly kind and polite, but I felt the conversation would never end... until a little boy walked by, tripped over and she ran to provide care and love to him.
I took this opportunity to get outta there.
It'd be easier if you just observed someone of color.
Example: if a white person and an asian are both at a bus stop standing a few feet apart, the bus will almost always stop right at the white person.
Even better if you're a white chick.
Just watch.
