They don't want kids to know about LGBT topics partly because it makes it easier to indoctrinate them to be homophobic and transphobic, but also because they don't want them to know that being LGBT is an option.
If they're taught that it exists, queer kids will realize at a younger age that they're queer.
So long as they don't know they can be queer, they're more likely to remain closeted long enough to, say, make the kind of life decisions that will make it significantly harder to come out at a later date, such as getting married and having children.
In the case of trans kids, transition will be significantly easier, cheaper and yield better results if started at a young age, and the GOP certainly doesn't want that.
If they can't transition young, trans people are more likely to give up on ever transitioning.
In general, be courteous to others.
