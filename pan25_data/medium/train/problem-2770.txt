So, gold imports from Russia are sanctioned yet they increased significantly since these sanctions are in place and "nobody knows" who's buying it in Switzerland?
But the newspaper has these figures from the Swiss customs authorities?
I can't even get a post card correctly delivered to my next door neighbour if I don't put both our names and addresses on it, but somehow these gold bars are imported without the officials knowing who they are delivered to?
In August, Switzerland, which is a major global hub for processing gold, adopted European Union sanctions prohibiting the trade of Russian gold and gold products.
But this appears to be having little impact on Russian gold imports.
In November, 6.4 tons of gold worth CHF344 million ($370 million) arrived from Russia, but the identity of the buyer is unclear.
Unfortunately the article doesn't mention that at all (that the imports might have been Russia satisfying an order that pre-dates the sanctions).
Where do you have that information from?
No, because there are loopholes, e.g.
with respect to the cutoff date.
Those imports mentioned in the article are not sanctioned, otherwise they would have been blocked by the officials.
