Meh, builds character.
I have a good friend who is in his thirties and he literally can't listen to opposing points of view.
I tried to show him a 10 minute clip that I knew was contrary to point of view but I believe was a well reasoned counter point.
He started shaking his head, his knee was vibrating and he only lasted about two minutes before he had to leave the room he was so upset.
Every picture of Tucker Carlson looks like he just sat on a pinecone unexpectedly.
I don't think he's capable of actually closing his mouth long enough to get a picture of it.
Is my friend too fragile?
Oh yeah but I don't think he is alone.
Not all people his age have this issue but with people growing up in social media bubbles it becomes ever more important to step outside your comfort zone.

I don't participate often (because then I get upset and they just down vote you anyway) and when I do I try to be courteous.
