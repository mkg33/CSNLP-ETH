REDMAP was created in 2010 - what happened after the 2012 autopsy was a combination of two things.
First, the 2014 midterms were the lowest turnout elections since 1942, and provided a massive gain for Republicans in Congress.
This helped solidify the notion that lowering turnout was a path to electoral success (Republicans have always been doing this, but 2014 was a case study in how to do it harder).
The path forward from there was to make inroads with socially conservative minorities, particularly Latinos, and do everything possible to suppress Democratic leaning constituencies.
