I'm a dealership mechanic for Stellantis, which includes Ram and Jeep.
The mechanical sides of both of those are pretty solid.
The electronics, however, are a complete shitshow.
There's a lot of things to like about the newer high-end Ram 1500's and Wagoneers and Grand Cherokees, but for the substantial prices what too many people get is giant headaches and undriveable vehicles, waiting for parts that aren't available.
edit...Just checked and the KIA system is not too bad; you need to be within 2 inches to clone the key and even then you still need to hotwire the car.
The locks issue has been there for a decade.
Musk refuses to fix it.
It's not really an issue with electric cars; it's an issue with Tesla specifically.
Also on Tesla the drive train is far from bulletproof.
The battery packs are unreliable and incredibly expensive.
Also the control computer is designed to fail by overwriting it's eMMC over and over again.
If you fix it you risk being kicked off the charging network.
Musk knows.
Musk wants these things to make himself more money.
