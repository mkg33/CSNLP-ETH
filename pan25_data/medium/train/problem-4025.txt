And besides that, RCV is probably not the best alternative voting method, it's just better than first past the post.
The sooner we move past "which alternative voting method is best"-paralysis to "why not start with any better one at any level," the better.
America could use every alternative voting method in a mix from RCV to STV to multi member elections/districts, etc... and it would be better than anywhere right now using single member, first past the post systems.
It's the worst style of voting over time for anything with higher stakes than "where are we going to lunch.
".
