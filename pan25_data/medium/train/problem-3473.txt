The mere act of Russia negotiating with Ukraine is an acknowledgement that Ukraine is a sovereign country.
(I don't like this, but we have to restore links between Russia and the world.
Also we don't want them to sink into an economic depression, where nationalistic fevers arise.
).
They will be reported world wide.
Some war info will leak into Russia, which otherwise tightly controls the media.
Tell us you don't know what a frozen conflict is without telling us you don't know what a frozen conflict is.
Russia has lost all of its key defensible points now, and its entire front line is in the process of organized retreat.
They have no where to fall back to defensively other than behind their borders.
Ukraine is not going to stop fighting in the winter, and Russia has no winter fighting gear or experience at this point, and Ukraine has 10 years worth.
I dont think you realize how far this can escalate before the Russians concede their annexed territories.
Putin can call for a full war economy.
Every chip that goes into making a car or phone will now make a missle.
Every babuskha in the country will be sewing uniforms.
Milions of men will be drafted to fight.
On a ugly scale the conflict is only at a 4/10 right now.
Neither side will give in.
The casualty potential before either side achieves a military victory is ungodly.
If they dont acheive military victory by next year they will be under pressure to end this through diplomacy and let the country recover.
Russia has problems as well but they have 100million more people than Ukraine.
Yes we want Ukraine to win.
But its about winning at what cost.
Cooler heads will prevail, they will sit down next year and iron something out.
