Ukraine casualties among soldiers have generally been ballpark similar to Russian ones but there are so many caveats that nobody should draw conclusions yet.
We probably won't get a clear picture of this war for years to come.
For now, Ukraine is kicking the everliving crap out of Russia and hopefully the war won't drag on too much longer.
It probably will, but we can hope.
I think itâ€™s a misunderstanding of the word casualty.
Casualty means dead or wounded.
Casualty was accidentally turned into killed somewhere between the information and the speech writer.
Ukraine claims 13k, I'd triple that, now mention of 100k casualties, then at 1:3 ratio would fit the number.
was 100 000 military dead and wounded on the Russian side and probably the same ballpark on the Ukrainian side, and 40 000 Ukrainian civilians.
I wouldn't be surprised if the Russians had worse dead to wounded ratio though, considering their apparently poor battlefield injury care.
The accurate numbers of course won't be known before the end of war as understandably it isn't in the interests of the warring parties to release them in the middle of it.
