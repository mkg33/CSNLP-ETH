But they are negotiable for Australia clearly, they attended the Qatar world cup, hosting won by Qatar through bribes.... Australia obviously saw enough cash flow from that for them to ignore the abuses and deaths involved.
Yeah, I really don't agree when people say "x isn't politics".
Human rights, very clearly and obviously is and has always been a political issue.
Where you stand on it is a political stance.
Nah.
He is clearly getting ahead of the criticism.
One party says not doing y cause x.
Other party responds by saying they're not doing y cause of politics.
It's not that human rights doesn't become a political issue, it's that it shouldn't be in politics at all.
Western idealization is like you say, if only it were true in the west.
And it clearly is for them..... Australia were in the world cup in Qatar, they received enough money for those human rights to not matter...so maybe they are correct, it's not about politics, it's about money.
Yes all of those female athletes that the Taliban will send out, they can definitely claim asylum in the UAE.
Absolutely nothing wrong with that plan.
Australia "human rights are not politics"....yet they sent the football team to the world cup in Qatar.
No country that participated in that or player that went has any right to lecture on human rights, they were given enough money for those abuses to not matter to them.
