My PRESENT is the continual invasion of Palestine by Israel who keeps plowing up Palestinian homes, killing Palestinians, and putting in Israel housing.
Just because there was a war decades ago doesn't justify continual encroachment any more than 2014 Crimea justifies Russia to keep taking Ukranian land.
Texas/Mexico had a war, maybe Mexico should start taking Texas land?
I'm an Israeli and I thinkt the title is a bit misleading.
Recognizing the Palestinian Nakba doesn't necessarily mean calling the founding of Israel a catastrophe.
The Nakba refers to the mass displacement of Palestinians following the war between the Jewish and Arab communities of Palestine/Israel.
When many people become refugees, it's a catastrophe for them.
No matter which side you believe had a more righteous cause, or bore more responsibility for the end result, it is a catastrophe nevertheless for Palestinians.
Therefore, it would be more accurate to say that the UN passed a resolution recognizing the creation of the Palestinian refugee problem as a catastrophe.
