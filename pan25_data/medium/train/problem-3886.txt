Only a complete moron would leave to fight someone elses wars.
They will either get killed on the battlefiled or be jailed when they come back, at least thats the current law.
The dream is to pull a Hemingway (the first American to volunteer to serve in WW1) but the conflicts of today are a lot murkier.
Going off to fight in Syria raises a million red flags.
Does with Ukraine as well.
This sounds nice on paper but I'm not sure this politically expedient stance reflects the country as a whole:
I found it hard to imagine he isn't simply trying to reap the best of both worlds while the country remains largely pro-Russia, and more importantly, pro-invasion.
I don't mind the thought of "giving them a shot" and hoping attitudes change with time, but recent times make me far less optimistic about such approaches where the opposite often occurs, and EU veto powers is too much of a gamble.
We already see this with Hungary and their people are far less happy about the invadion.
