wtf, like Israel has had no role in the prevention of a Palestinian democracy?
That's literally Netanyahu (and Sharone's, and ...) life's work, preventing a functioning Palestinian state.
>Israel's N12 news released a poll on Saturday revealing that 62% of Israelis want the proposed judicial plans to be either paused or halted all together.
The Palestinians don't want democracy at all.
And for sure not a democracy with Israel or with jews.
Like it or not, the Islamist ideology is not built for democracy.
And if the Palestinians wanted a democracy, they would have had it by now in Gaza.
Ofc I didn't mean ALL Palestinians, and some do want democracy, but like I said, if most wanted it, they would have had it by now.
To your last question - if they wanna be part of the Israeli society, that just want to live in peace, and not praise the killing of jews, I more than welcome them to be able to vote.
edit: There's also other Arab almost-democracies like Lebanon that have been significantly destabilized by Israel.
