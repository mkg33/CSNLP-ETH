Not just encourage, but enforce.
Firsthand experience here.
During a pre-sale I impulsively bought a wildly overpriced front row ticket to a show that advertised certain featured performers.
But when the official cast of the tour was announced and it didn't include anyone I was interested in, I decided to sell the ticket because I could use the money.
I literally was not able to sell the ticket at the price I bought it, let alone lower.
I think it made me mark it up by at least twenty bucks and no one bought it until like a week before the event.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
