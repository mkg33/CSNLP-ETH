One doubts that the authors of this policy contemplated bad-faith challenges becoming commonplace, but they ought to have considered this obvious structural flaw.
Anyone could challenge any book for any reason, or no reason.
In a few hours I could print off formal challenges to every book in a library's catalog.
By policy, they'd have to remove their entire collection from circulation.
This absurd outcome proves the ineptness of the stated policy.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
- During the adjudication of a challenge, the challenged book remains generally available, however, the library may not check it out to children of anyone who signed the challenge.
- Since the 1st Amendment is a constitutional right, local prejudices do not trump that right.
Therefore, only a Federal court can permanently remove any book from a public library.
