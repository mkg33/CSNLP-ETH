Edit: I thought the satire was more obvious than I guess it turned out to be.
None of what I wrote is true, this isn't a real quote, I was sarcastically shitposting.
Propaganda doesn't necessarily need to make up stories, not always.
It just needs to amplify convenient messages.
Or inconvenient, if the intent is to sow division instead.
The first paragraph is something that could 100% be real,but the 2nd... Is it possible that they aren't realizing that everyone who volunteered himself before the mobilization was accepted(with some extreme exceptions ofc)?...
Unfortunately, as far as the most insane supporters of Putin go, it is definitely possible.
And the 3rd paragraph confirms it is a satire for sure.Edit: My Russian friends believe that it is a fake for propaganda purposes and leading mobilization.
The fake was so bad that I thought that it was satire, the real explanation seems to be that propaganda it out of even barely reasonable writers.
Although I've gotta' say that it's more than a little disconcerting that my shitpost read as realistic Kremlin propaganda to your Russian friends.
It's like when I would write a quote in Trump's voice and it confused people.
Nope, I'm pleased to tell you that it was just satire, I only left off the /s because I wanted to see if anyone would believe it, I guess the Russian people believed it... sort of.
Not much of a win, now that I think about it.
