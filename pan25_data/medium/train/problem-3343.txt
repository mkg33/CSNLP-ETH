Part of the issue is the border wall is a political toy.
Full stop.
Most illegal immigration is the result of people overstaying valid visas.
They just come here legally and disappear.
Most gun and drug smuggling occurs through legal ports of entry, especially on ships.
Most people trying to cross the border AT the border are refugees claiming asylum, and it is not illegal to claim asylum.
We need to increase border patrol presence, offer aid at the border, and facilitate increased volumes of asylum hearings to establish status or justify deportation.
The stupid wall is a massive boondoggle that serves no purpose but to get people riled up and waste billions of dollars.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
