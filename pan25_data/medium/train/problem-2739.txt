The state is asking them not to teach children.
To lie about important parts of history.
It is a horrific situation, but it is not going to stop until we make it stop.
I would hope the sight of armed state officials removing books from classrooms would make the public understand and rally around teachers.
What other option is there?
Do nothing and let it get worse?
Is that going to improve teachers' conditions?
Every day, it will get harder to fight back, and the punishment for resisting will get worse.
Every quiet concession will just invite more control and overreach.
There has to be a breaking point.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
