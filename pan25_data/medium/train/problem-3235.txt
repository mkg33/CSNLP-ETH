The U.S. currently lacks a credible counter to the new chinese strategy of overwhelming local force superiority, aka force numbers.
China will send 100 jets and if they manage to sink a ship or two it's worth it for them.
The do not care about losing pilots.
This is an issue because current stealth and other capable fighter or multi-role aircraft lack the number of munitions to deal with such large swarms of enemies.
An F-22 can almost certainly take on several J-10s and probably several J-20s, but they lack the range and missiles to destroy large groups.
Once this aircraft is deployed with the next gen AIM or JTAM (Co developed by Northrop who are making the bomber and Lockheed martin) this thing will probably be able to mount dozens of them if not more, which would effectively eliminate the Chinese local air advantage over their home waters.
Oh and we don't like that we spend all this money on military and not health care but I'll be damned if I don't hear Jimi Hendrix playing the national anthem when it's being used to beat the Russian invaders.
