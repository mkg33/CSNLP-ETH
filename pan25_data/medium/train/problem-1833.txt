Indirectly.
The court's premise is that if temperatures keep rising (which may happen no matter what Germany does), the government should enact "severe" or "comprehensive" losses of freedom.
Government is removing current freedoms to slightly increase the probability of saving future freedoms--from the government.
Just because we chose to not criminalise paedophilia while getting massive donations from child pornography syndicates and subsidising pornography websites, does not mean we are negligent or culpable.
So a rapid reduction to net zero, ultimately leading to a policy of gross zero (certain freedoms to be "essentially prohibited").
And based on an underlying threat that if temperatures keep rising, the proper response could involve.
Which is why this kind of lawsuit usually doesn't go anywhere.
Most countries don't have mandated legislation that the parliament is required to pass by the Constitution.
Generally speaking, it's usually not illegal to fail to enact policy, no matter how dire the consequences.
