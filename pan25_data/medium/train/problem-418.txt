I find this particularly juicy because Fox News is the number one cable news channel and Tucker has the most popular cable “news” broadcast.
The issue was clearly that Republicans didn’t like the candidate they were given.
DeSantis did fine.
Kemp did fine.
Rubio did fine.
Trump losers did not.
Last night Tucker showed zero ability to look in the mirror.
He claimed the only reason Republicans underperformed was because the liberal media failed to put their message out there.
Actually the opposite is true!
They had their message paid for by the richest summabitches in the country, they had all these fake polls drawn up to look like the democrats were losing.
They did everything in their power up to an including shouting into the tv camera as loudly and fearful as possible about INFLATION, GAS PRICES, HIGH FOOD PRICES, and CUTTING SOCIAL SECURITY, that the people decided 'no fuck that' and voted for the democrats.
This is why Fox 'news' and their cadre of hate mongers needs a very public slap down and defunding.
Boycott their advertisers is a good start.

Please if you have any questions or concerns.
It is maddening.
100% streaming might help that except for the fact that it seems everywhere there is a public TV it is nearly always tuned into Fox News.
