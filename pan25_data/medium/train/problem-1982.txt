Just to clarify- Ukraine will not push anywhere outside its own borders because the one and only objective Ukraine has here is full control of own borders and peace, safety and prosperity within said borders.
The people of Ukraine support only that and the current government represents the people of Ukraine.
Ukraine does not want or need anything outside of its borders.
Otherwise, yes, Ukraine would lose the moral high ground and a big chunk of support.
But I think one of the reasons Ukraine has an overwhelming moral high ground here is precisely that Ukraine genuinely, to the very bones only wants what belongs to Ukraine within its own territory and not a iota beyond that.
dude, if russia doesn't demolish it the minute the Ukrainians enter Mariupol, as in shelling range - they would be dumber than what they have shown already.
Typically yes, not letting your enemy capture a bridge is a big deal because then you can stop their advance.
But there's no way Ukraine is going to push through Crimea into Russia.
They would quickly start to lose the moral high ground and international support.
