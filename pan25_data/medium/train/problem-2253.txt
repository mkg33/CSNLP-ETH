Correct me if I am wrong… but I was under impression that investments into business development are NOT taxable?
If Mr Opedal took 10B USD from profits and put them into Renewables, he will have 10B less of taxable income… and just maybe he would not need to pay windfall taxes.
There should be permanent “windfall tax”.
It should be financially meaningless to try to get profitability over some reasonable threshold.
Especially for something like energy/food/shelter/health… something humans HAVE to spend money on, rather than something they choose to spend money on.
I don’t care if you can charge 10 times as much for bottle of Kristal, just because some one with big name at some point in the past could not afford Dom Pérignon.
I do care when people have to choose between keeping house worm and having dinner.
Be me, I have an internet modem, a power over Ethernet switch, 2 WiFi devices and my pc, my pc is only on when I'm home and obviously lights, fridge, oven/cooker and kettle.
I pay £200 a month.
I literally cannot reduce my consumption without removing equipment.
