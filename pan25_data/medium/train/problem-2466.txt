I don’t know a whole lot about the “euthanasia being available to the mentally ill” idea, but many people who choose this option for when they are actively and painfully dying.
I don’t think it’s dystopian to explain to a child: “hey, this person is very severely ill and will not be getting better.
They are choosing to die now, while they are in less pain, instead of dying a week later.” It’s certainly not more traumatizing than seeing someone you love get so sick that they’re barely recognizable.
And the morons will come out and comment without reading the story, or to further their agenda that Canada, <ahem> the Libs, are trying to enact a genocide...
Calling it an “activity book” is definitely a biased way of interpreting the material, which is about preparing children for an unfamiliar and frightening event.

You’re right of course.
I somehow missed that when reading the article.
I still think it’s an unfortunate title, but my original statement was inaccurate.
The kid is going to be hurt no matter how the person dies.
Explaining it clearly can help the kid come to terms with the death, and it keeps them from finding out in a worse way, like overhearing it out of context.
