Edit: Since many people are pointing out that there's an engine replacement for the B-52, I'm aware.
But it's like putting a bandaid on a bullet wound.
You can't fix a fundamentally flawed design with better parts.
Nobody in their right mind would think about powering a heavy bomber with 8 tiny business-jet engines, but it's the only choice they have with the wing geometry that they're stuck with.
If the US were to procure another heavy bomber from scratch (which nobody wants to pay for, hence why the B-52 is going to have a 100 year program life), they'd start with something like a 787 which has a similar MTOW and produces more thrust with its stock engines than the BUFF does with its 8 tiny inefficient engines.
This may sound weird but the sheer amount of Soviet ammo out there that’s 30-40 years old is astonishing.
It used to be imported here and sold cheaply but now since there’s no ammo imports allowed from Russia anymore prices have risen but people still shoot the ammo and stockpile the ammo all the time.
