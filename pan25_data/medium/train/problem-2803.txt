Banana republic shit holes.
Someone tries to expose the people behind one of the biggest disasters in the country's history, and not only do they release the suspects for no good reason but they also want to arrest the judge trying to expose them.. fuckin classic.
>	In August 2020, judges at the Special Tribunal for Lebanon found Salim Ayyash, a mid-level operative in Hezbollah, guilty in absentia of five charges including the intentional murder of Hariri with premeditation by using explosive materials.
Iran makes sure that Hezbollah is more powerful than the official lebanese army by giving them arms, money, and training.
Hezbollah is more powerful than the lebanese state, and lebanese officials know what the danger is in crossing them.
Sadly Hezbollah has ruined my country and made most of the younger generation like me immigrate and never go back.
They're evil and their whole purpose in life is to install sharia law like in Iran and to destroy Israel no matter the cost.
Demonic you could say.
The right time won't ever come, cause they know if they try to take on Israel, Israel will beat their asses like a bunch of darbuka drums.
Those sophisticated weapons Iran is giving them are in reality copycat Chinese/Soviet era weapons and won't do much against Israel's far superior military tech.
I'm not Lebanese and I dunno much about Lebanon, but the GF is and from what she told me Hezbollah is both incapable and unwilling to threaten Israel.
I mean it seems that terrorist organization has done way more to hurt Lebanon than to hurt Israel.
And I think Israel is far far better than Hezbollah.
