They might not even need to do that.
Just seize any interest and put liens on value appreciations as collateral for loans.

Yeah countries are worried about precedents, but much of this is stolen/funneled money and even if it isn't, Russia has been given every opportunity and then some to cooperate and they've given the middle finger to international law at every step.
There's already stable financing arranged to almost that amount, combined from €18bn from EU member states, $18bn from the US, and a $3-4bn loan from the IMF (I think).
Make Russian oligarchs pay for it.
They robbed from Russia.
Russia destroyed Ukraine.
So makes sense that they should pay the bill to fix Ukraine if it can’t come directly from Russia itself.
This is being delivered in a predictable monthly flow to make things easier for planning and to re-assure markets.
