Let's be honest, Fox News isn't a news organization, it's a right-wing propaganda machine.
They peddle fear, outrage, and misinformation to their viewers on a daily basis, all in the name of advancing a political agenda.
True journalism involves seeking out the facts and reporting them objectively, but Fox News is more interested in pushing a particular narrative than in informing the public.
It's time we stopped treating them as a legitimate news source and started calling them out for what they really are.
