The sad truth is that when religion is in control, the army and the government is 100% ideological and that system cannot be reasoned with.
The Vatican will never agree to that.
I also believe that the Vatican is possible the world's worst culprit for corruption, evil deeds, siding with aggressors and anything in general that is most foul including paedophilia.
Who though, thinks it is a good idea to make leaders of anything celibate?
That is torture in and of itself.
Hardly conducive to making a person compassionate.

Religion should have nothing to do with governance, ever, unless the government asks for a religious perspective on policy for any reason.
Religion should be there to care for the souls of the individuals not impose it's stilted opinions on entire nations.
That sht is just wrong.
