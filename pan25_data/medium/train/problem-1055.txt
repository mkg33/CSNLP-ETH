The American administration wouldn’t have done what they did if they didn’t consider potential consequences and the Saudi administration wouldn’t be doing what it is doing for no reason.
Based off the Americans recent actions it seems they are more concerned with the pacific and revitalizing it’s homeland.
It’s entirely possible the Americans no longer care and the Saudi Arabians are trying to goad the Americans back into caring or they may be courting China as an alternative in the event the Americans actually don’t care anymore.
I do doubt China will waste money and military assets abroad defending Saudi Arabia though.
Things are definitely changing.
Naaa China imports most of its energy resources.
They need the Saudis for their sweet sweet oil.
The Saudis and China need the US to guarantee free passage of shipping.
China has a huge fleet but very few ships are capable of blue water force protection over the distances needed to secure their oil supplies.
Saudi also needs a guaranteed of their security.
Their war against the Houthi’s have proven they are a mediocre military power despite all the hardware they buy.
If a rival power like Iran decided to mix it up with the Saudis they’d roll them without our protection.
