Let’s hope the new PM they have coming in decides to do something about that place.
As long as there is any kind of delusion in that region that they can splinter off to join Russia, Moldova will never be safe from conspiracy and corruption.
Bullies will push and push for what they want until there’s nothing left standing in their way.
Too bad no one with the exception of Russia really gives a fck about Moldova.
Even though during the last years they've started moving towards the EU, and improving their relations with Romania, Moldova really has little to no support against Russia.
They are not a large country like Ukraine, they do not have military calabilities, they are not manufacturing military equipment nor do they have well developed industries besides wine-making.
Moreover, Moldavan citizens have to go through a strict border control when going to Transnistria, that is officially part of Moldova, just to visit their relatives.
The Transnistrian Russian-backed self proclaimed autonomous government imposes the border control that does not allow anyone to enter with cameras, microphones.
Transnistria also has its own Russian-backed military.
If Moldova hasn't been able to clean house, I doubt they have any power to negotiate with Russia.
