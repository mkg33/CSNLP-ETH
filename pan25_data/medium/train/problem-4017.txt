The middle class is what makes democracies strong.
Not the rich.
Not the poor.
The middle class have the ability to make changes and the desire that make them.
The rich don’t want change.
The poor don’t have the ability.
There is a reason why Authoritarian governments always fail.
The lies become a house of cards that is destined to fall.
Russia has the greatest disparity of wealth in the word.
In a country of 140 million people about 9000 people have over 90% of the assets.
This is by and large wholly true.
Examples being the rigidity of decision making in the Third Reich.
The part about having the heart to see things through is probably the most important aspect.
Underlying lots of "failures" by democracies in war have been a sense of moral ambiguity about the aims and the desire for men to not die needlessly, something the Russians feel they can capitalise on by making the cost of the war too great for public opinion.
Thankfully I don't envisage that happening at all in Ukraine although my sense is things are going to get very messy before it's all over.
Putin thinks he's literally fighting for his life and he probably is making this an all in face off.
Foremost for Ukraine to win is to keep the message about the collective need to defeat Putin uppermost in the minds of everyone in countries supporting the war effort.
If that aspect is achieved the Russians are totally screwed from an ability to fight modern war.
