That's right.
Who else should we stand with?
America that nuclear bombed two civilian cities?
Europe that has made negligible efforts to aid growth?
Its still bad for russia since they are forced to sell it at a massive discount which is then resold for cheapo to the us and eu and so russia keeps losing money.
Would like to point out that US and Europe are india's biggest customers right now, so they are hiding behind India.
India's oil consumption has not gone up.
So if other folks were not buying oil from India, India would have no reason to continue buying more.
Also, you should say shame on the Indian government.
Not all of us are unsympathetic towards Ukraine and a small but significant majority does not want the government buying Russian oil.
Russia is one of the only countries that has helped India for decades.
They're the reason we've been able to defend our borders and counter terrorism.
The middle East has also been a great help over the years.
The US is a bully.
The Russia invasion is not something India supports.
But we need to feed the countless starving and dying.
