only musk didn't just give them for free, he's getting paid for them by the DoJ, so this is waaaaaay better.
i mean it was cool of musk to coordinate getting them there in like two days, but i feel the DoJ had more to do with that than musk did after all the recent news lol.
Yup, they're quite good at doing things like offering all of their products for free or at a greatly reduced price for x amount of time.

Microsoft has been helping Ukraine a lot since the war started.
You dont have to like the company to appreciate their efforts to help Ukraine.
Also, tons of other non-mil companies are helping out Ukraine without announcing it, which is awesome.
I got tricked into buying a HP printer because I don’t print much and needed a cheap one.

They’re basically a wifi-capable paperweight.
