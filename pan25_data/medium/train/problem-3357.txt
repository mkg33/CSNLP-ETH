Even if they pretend it's cool for the four weeks of the World Cup as soon as the people and the cameras leave they'll go back to imprisoning and killing people.
Edit: To answer comments yes all these countries are Muslim majority.
And as an American who is an immigrant from a Muslim majority country yes the religion is generally antagonistic to gays and non believers.
Although most other religions (including Judaism and Christianity) aren't very gay friendly either.
Malaysia is a federation and its only one member, Terengganu, that technically has the death penalty for apostasy.
Its never been enforced and would be challenged at a federal level.
Its totally ok to not be muslim in that state but if you are and try to leave....fuck you...makes no sense.
Its like having a house where the children are abused, and they decide to throw a fancy dinner party, inviting family and other children.
The children who come will be allowed to behave however they want with no consequences, but the ones who live there know that if they participate, they will be abused once the guests leave.
Why would you go to that dinner party at all?
