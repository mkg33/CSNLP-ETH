For context and for fun, Lord Ashcroft is a major Tory party donor, billionaire publisher, and famous in some circles as the man who self-published that book which claimed David Cameron put his knob in a dead pig's mouth.
The way things are going champ most of the UK population will be down to three square meals of fingernails come 2026.
Yer propped up man's £2.2bn gulf won't even make a mark in the mind of the average Scottish voter come that time.
See he'd do well right now to recognise that the party he's throwing lumps of that £2.2bn at are actually in power right now, actually, right, now.
They are also trying to hobble any sort of drawing out process that could actually do them some good in the debate, by debate.
Instead we'll get these, Brexit-lite, hope for the shit to still cling, tit-bits of well it must be true, car crash internet "news" posts and polls that do nothing for the real problems in this Country.
Scottish voters can't link independence to gender reform?
I can't link why having an opinion on one necessitates an opinion on the other, this lot did, somehow.
Yer all playing the wrong game here, it just exacerbates the actual reason that folks even vote SNP, so I'll spell it out for you.
They're no the best, then they got power and they're still no the best, far from it but they are the best out of the other things that have been tried so far.
So stop throwing money at shit that might stick and actually engage in worthwhile debate that furthers the Country and its people.
Maybe even turn a corner and bring folks with you with well thought out and different ideas.
This shit is just playground come stand here because we think its best for you.
Low effort, dogma, binary and assumed pish.
