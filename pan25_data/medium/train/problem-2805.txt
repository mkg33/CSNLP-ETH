This "shift in attitudes" is why conservatives are fighting their imagined "culture war" so frantically.
They realize the walls are closing in on their backward 19th Century agenda of pig ignorance.
The attitudes of hatred and intolerance that have fueled them for decades are slowly phasing out and Gen Z and Millennials are overtaking boomers as a voting block and they're more liberal and tolerant than any other generation before them.
Man, the future is BLEAK for Republicans.
They're either going to have to drastically rethink their attitudes, or face continual election loss.
They could easily get 40% minimum of the Black and Latino votes in every election if they just pandered to religious morals without being racist fucks.
But of course they don't do that despite it basically being a guaranteed win for the GOP in every election forever because that would be treating non-whites like people and that's too much to ask of them.
