I don't know the overall averages everywhere but it's been a pretty active year for "bomb cyclones" and the like.
I mean… the alternative is just extended, ultra-dry conditions, which also hasn’t been great for wildfires.
At least with the rain there’s tangible benefit through the snowpack in the mountains.
Even if we view them as worse then most because they're an exporter of fossil fuels, I think much of the blame continues to fall on the west.
The people who buy the fuel and then burn it are also at fault (looking at you Germany).
The war in Ukraine might actually be helping.
Now there’s an immediate threat that is causing us to move towards renewables faster than we would have otherwise.
I don't like it when people say "thank this country we all hate for climate change" for a few reasons.
Mostly it's because it is a gross oversimplification and is often used to kick the can down the road when it comes to renewable energy and fighting the climate crisis.
You hear it all the time in the states "we can't do anything about Climate Change, even if we tried China and Russia would continue emitting.
".
We can't just blame exporters of fossil fuels for climate change.
Until countries that rely on fossil fuels move to green alternatives, there will always be a demand for fuel.
My point was simply blaming Russia for climate change because they are a net exporter of fossil fuels kinda diverts attention from the countries that are dependent on Russian fossil fuels like Germany.
If Russia stopped exporting fuel to Germany (which it largely has) Germany would continue to be a large greenhouse producer and source its fuel from other places like the Middle East or the United States.
