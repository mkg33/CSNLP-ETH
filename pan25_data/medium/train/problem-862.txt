"Rep. Daniel Crenshaw, a third-term Texas Republican, called McCarthy’s opponents “political terrorists” who had put Republicans on a “path to suicide and getting Biden reelected in ’24.”".
It is not coincidence that this is occurring while trump is coyly hinting that he will start a third party.
There is a massive amount of money at stake, and personal earnings are all these people care about.
This could go on for a very long time.
In a week, would 6 Republicans accept a compromise Liz Cheney as Speaker?
Would McCarthy accept binding concessions to Democrats for their votes?
Who else could break the performative protest by these 20 maga members?
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
And again, trump and the Maga crowd don't care about winning elections.
They care that their supporters are outraged and willing to donate massive amounts of money.
In my opinion, the best step for Republicans is to accept short term losses to evict the Maga wing from the party.
If the allow trump the breathing room to attempt a third party, they will seriously have to move left to win elections.
Just 5% support for a trump party would greatly damage Republicans.
