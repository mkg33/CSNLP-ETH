It’s actually because we collect road taxes through gas sales, so if we go all electric people won’t be paying their part for the roads if they don’t change how that is collected.
You can’t tax something else like tires, because people can just go out of state every 50k miles.
That makes sense only if they are evening out the average.
Meaning that they have found that the average person pays $300 in tax from filling up their gas tank.
Google says the average driver uses about 650 gallons a year.
Tn charges 27.4 cents per gallon.
So, approximately $178 dollars a year in tax per person earned through a gas tax.
They want to up the electric tax to $300.
So, unless TN drivers have a much higher average usage, or google is wrong, they're overcharging electric car users by approximately $122 a year.
So, they want to charge EV owners nearly double what ICE owners pay.
They know people with EVs probably aren't Republicans anyway, so its a safe group to raise taxes on, and it excites their base to hurt people who care about the planet, so for them it's win/win.
Perverts.
