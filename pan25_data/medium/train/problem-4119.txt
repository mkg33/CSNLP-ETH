Buy some thick ass leather gloves (or gauntlets, even better) if you decide to roll that bad boy out.
It's sharp as hell, and will dig into your skin if given the chance.
No need to hurt yourself if you're just trying to keep the out-laws at bay.
Yes, I'm well aware of those.
Really damn expensive though, and simple leather gauntlets will do the job for home security.. if you're laying a few miles or more, then you're gonna get cut up real good.. leather apron is a good shout as well.
Okay since yall being dramatic about the gender (I agree it is MOTHERLAND but it totally missed the point of my comment) here ya go:
Aw, Serbia misses our attention and wants a replay of the last asskicking we handed them for this type of clownery.
Sadly, NATO is not the bad guy that Russia makes us out to be, so Serbia will probably have to start committing genocide again in order to get that sweet, sweet love from us that they so obviously crave.
Sorry George, I know you’re being genocided right now and we COULD help protect you and put an end to at least the horrible murder of your people, but you don’t own a NATO passport so really my hands are tied here.
Immoral and bankrupt of all empathy?
Well that may be but you see we don’t have any valid reason to be here as said by a Reddit comment so we have to let thousands of innocents die.
