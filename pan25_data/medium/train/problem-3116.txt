This is a very poorly written headline.
Also I'm not sure why a bad chatbot would have that great an effect on stock prices.
Do investors rly only care about buzzwords and what's trendy ATM?
Bear in mind that AI is “trendy” and a “buzzword” right now not because of some fad, but because we’re in the nascent stages of an exploding market with absolutely MASSIVE commercial potential.
Many companies are recently/now actively commercializing AI, and the potential rewards are huge.
And it’s less about proving commercial viability than it is about establishing market share - and doing so early.
The companies that have dominant market share now stand a good chance of keeping that share, and becoming the new standard for AI.
This is an important time in the fledgling AI market, as it could determine long-term winners and losers.
So it’s more than just a buzzword.
People pay these insanely high prices because Google will only grow.
That is until the company starts to die, then they panic and flee into something not so insane.
Because to me, that is a ridiculous ticket price for the ride.
