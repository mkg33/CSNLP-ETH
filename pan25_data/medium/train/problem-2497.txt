(I still love the story of how a super fan made dumb pens to support Trump and sold them online, Trump found out and tried to sue him into the ground for using his trademark.
Now the super fan hates him.
).
Like a drop of fish blood to a starving shark, Trump could smell money being made off his name and wants a piece.

Didya know Trump was friends with Hitl,...er Nixon?
Yep, he had to get real close to Evil to know how to copy it.
His own sire, er father wasn't evil enough for him.
Not going to lie, I kinda feel left out that Trump hasn't sued me for voting against him or whatever garbage lawsuit off the 37 he files on a given day.
Trump: Woodward said, "What kind of silly lie can you make up if I ask you who you are?"
and I said, "My name is George Santos" and Woodward just laughed and laughed and he recorded it.
He thought everything I said was just fantastic, the best.
People are saying everything I say is perfect.
