What a crock of shit that is, Putin’s initial plan was to enter Kiev and kill Zelensky because that would reestablish control back to Russia.
How come Putin doesn’t show up in the front lines with Russian soldiers, is he too chicken to get a bullet behind his head or is he too busy spreading propaganda about the war and jailing people that say a negative opinion about the war in Ukraine.
Why not let Navalny speak and let him free, is it not a smart move if this war is going well like Putin says.
But like his narcissistic con man Humpty Dumpty Trumpy Putin has realized he can’t win and will lose as revenues start dropping off the cliff and war will cost a lot more and something has to give.
Honestly I think putin would also fully accept zelensky running away to uk.
That what he would do.
I think that was the full expectation and then say the soldiers who were sent after him were for his protection and his arrest for crimes against Ukraine.
Zelensky remaining in Kyiv was something he didn't really considered.
Something which went against what he considers is reasonable and smart.
Everyone who believes that there is no place to wars on Earth, and who believes that aggressor must be punished - you can help Ukrainian people here:
