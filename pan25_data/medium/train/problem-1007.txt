In Vancouver (Canada) it got so out of hand it got crazy.
I saw stats not so long time ago and only 4% were Canadian buyers for properties over 600k.
it became a real issue; lots of chinese buying houses that are just sitting there empty.
Same goes for condos.
A friend of mine is a realtor and even he stated that things must change because long term itll be catastrophic for some cities.
He actually once sold 12 out of 20 apartments blocks to someone that paid cash (no bank financing).
Those are still empty 2y later.
You get shit for under 600k in Vancouver.
I have friends living there and it was literally impossible to buy a house there.
Both are working with 100k+ salaries.
I was like: "WTF?"
!
For owners that do that shit, there's squatting.
Where when the cops show up you claim that there's a lease.
Depending on the jurisdiction, once those words are spoken you've declared a civil dispute exists, and cops aren't going to get involved in that.
They'll advise the owner to refer the matter to a judge, and from the time to get on the docket, discovery, extensions, etc, that can go on for many months.
