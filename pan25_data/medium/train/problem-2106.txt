I mean the GOP underperformed because, even with some electable candidates (Laxalt, Fung), they really didn’t do enough to move away from Jan 6, election deniers, and anti-abortion views, which ruined them in suburbs.
Doesn't matter he gave GOP what they wanted and threw rest of the USA under the bus in process of doing it.
People were pissed and they screwed GOP back.
They have screwed Trump once and they will do it again if he wins nomination.
This time around they might increase the girth of dong that they will shove up his arse.

There were two main factors in the GOP drubbing and he was one of them.
I’d say his historical revisionism isn’t going to work, but all evidence points to the contrary.
That’s why you see Kelly winning by 5%, Fetterman winning by 5%, Shapiro by 15%, Whitmer by 11%, Warnock by 3%, Evers by 3%, Polis by 19%.
Dems did insanely well in key swing states because moderate voters were afraid of the GOP.
That’s why the GOP did well in safe Dem states (California, New York, Illinois, Oregon) because there was no fear over their policies being implemented due to the heavily blue state legislature.
But in a state like Wisconsin where the GOP gerrymandered themselves to a supermajority, the governorship is the only thing stopping it from being a one-party dictatorship.
