Not that I'm breaking any new ground here, but it's the very foundation for the current iteration of the "conservative" zeitgeist.
Everyone from the FORMER FREAKING PRESIDENT to a random stranger on the internet exist in a parasitic relationship where lies are sourced with rumors.
They don't need to know each other but they're all hopelessly dependant on the system they've created.
From Donald trying to avoid consequences to the guy at the gas station who's in too deep to turn back now.
Depending on the traction their post gets, any "big" names that agree with them are then used as further sources because "people are saying".
It's how Fox and Trump operated the entire time.
They surf the forums and mentions to see what their most devoted have cooked up, float it as a distraction, Tucker or whoever picks it up because Trump is yelling about it, Trump goes all in because "Fox just confirmed it".
And bet your last dollar that every internet stranger you met the next day will claim they don't listen to Trump and don't watch Fox but they know every detail and talking point so it must be true because again, "people are talking about it".
