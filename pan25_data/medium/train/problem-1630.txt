and the F-111 killed more tanks than the A-10 since the A-10 couldnt use the PAVE TACK system yet.
The A-10 primarily got low risk, low priority targets since they were extra vulnerable to AA systems (especially MANPADs and SAMs) and still more A-10's were shot down than any other airframe.
That was also against a very poorly equipped military.
Yeah Iraq had one of the largest militaries manpower wise, but the quality of their hardware was absolute dogshit.
Their T-55's and T-62's were export variants without any additional armor and supposedly even lacked an electric motor to rotate the turret, relying on a hand crank (cant verify the accuracy of this, it was reported by US tank commanders at the time but I cant find anything more official than hearsay).
I recall reading somewhere recently that for Ukraine to effectively take the initiative and go on the offensive in the spring they’d need another 2 armoured divisions minimum.
Seeing all the news about any armour from modernized T55s, to Bradley’s, to French light tanks headed their way it seems like they’re trying to scrape together everything with tracks and a cannon to get the fight going.
