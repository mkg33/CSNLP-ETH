One single test shot of a laser into a gold-coated fuel pellet managed to put out slightly more energy than was put in, known as Q.
However it ignored that the energy that came out was in the form of thermal energy, which is typically converted to electricity at an efficiency of 30-40%, and furthermore that the actual amount of power carried in the laser was on the order of 1% of the electricity used to generate it.
This is only one of a dozen or more approaches to fusion, and one of the ones least likely to lead to commercial fusion power.
So while it's a great scientific achievement, it still returned something like 0.004% of the input power.
Yep, and as I said it's a great scientific achievement.
Next steps would be to figure out what the perfect solution was on that unique fuel pellet, then get the laser efficiency way up (e.g.
different wavelenhs), and maybe throw in some magnetic confinement to improve the fusion efficiency.
The main research is in ITER, Wendelstein, SPARC, etc.
and then a whole load of more speculative commercial companies such as ZAP, Helion, CFS and other.
The commercial entities range from "Genuine if left-field prospects with real physics behind them" to "Blatantly obvious frauds looking for money".
I would be surprised if one of them doesn't produce a viable fusion generator on-grid in my lifetime.
I mean flying cars in theory aren't that difficult.
The real issue is that they would be way too expensive and need to give up a lot of features in comparison to normal ones.
There actually are working prototypes for flying cars for years now.
It's much worse than a normal car for close ranges and much worse than a plane at longer ranges though.
