Even in terms of firing inert missiles, it’s known as roof knocking.
It tends to be common, it’s a tactic used in densely populated areas which will essentially shift the civilian population away before a tactical strike.
The IDF perfected this tactic.
K, air to surface missiles.
- the recent articles on Reddit of Ukrainian military showing components on an inert missile is known as “kurt”.
Oh, hey, they actually listened to my correction.
They called it a dud earlier, which would have been a lot worse, because that would mean they launched an actual nuclear warhead that just failed to detonate.
Do you ever read the projected numbers though?
Even low amounts and mostly depleted still leaves them with 100s.
It's that they start firing payload-less missiles and using incredibly expensive anti-aircraft missiles to hit random ground targets and save the good stuff for the occasional revenge barrage against Kyiv.
If they had a huge number of good long range missiles, they'd be using them instead of ones built to be effective for other purposes.
This must be the third time this article has appeared in the last few hours, it’s nothing more than utter click bait given that the vast majority of missiles developed over the last few decades have all been nuclear capable, the Kent is no different.
