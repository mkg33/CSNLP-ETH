What's so funny is as bad as it will be for Democrats and the country if they lose the House by 1-2 seats, it'll be even worse for Republicans.
A 1-2 seat majority will tear the GOP apart.
McCarthy is effectively a deadman walking.
The GOP's crazy weirdo problem (Lauren Boebert, MTG, Matt Gaetz, Louie Gohmert, Paul Gosar, etc) isn't going away anytime soon.
Nevada, Arizona, and Georgia are all still in play, which would be 51 if they happen to break the right way.
If Nevada and Arizona go blue, I'm thinking that'll depress GOP turnout in Georgia since the Senate will be a lost cause to them by the time the runoff comes around.
Also, given the average number of seats that open up during a 2 year span, Republicans gaining and losing the House by 2024 isn't out of the realm of possibility - which would be utterly humiliating for them.
