This headline makes it sound like a good thing is happening and Joe Manchin is getting sabotaged, but in reality it looks like his bullshit is only sabotaging clean energy work (which Manchin has said he supports, but he's a greedy lying bastard who shouldn't be taken at his word on that).
At the risk of paraphrasing another dumbass Senator, let's dispel this fiction that Joe Manchin doesn't know exactly what he's doing.
Not surprising.
Manchinâ€™s biggest donors are fossil fuel companies and billionaires.
He has to appease his funding base.
Just like Sinema had to appease her Big Pharma donors.
