I hate that we're still treating elections like a football game.
The score predictions, the talk of hail maries.
This shit is not a game.
We are at the actual, no-joke, precipice of fascism.
And there's nowhere to run off to.
A Republican-controlled US that is aligned with Russia will absolutely change the entire world order for the worst.
Israel is back with Netanyahu.
Brazil barely scraped by.
Orban keeps consolidating power.
Italy elected an actual neofascist as president.
Global democracy is on its way out, and a GOP takeover will snuff the flame for at least a generation.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
