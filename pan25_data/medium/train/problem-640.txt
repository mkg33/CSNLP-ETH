I'm sure this comment will inevitably show up on any post with the tag "Israel/Palestine", regardless of whether it actually reflects or contributes to any meaningful conversation.
This year the Palestinians have killed a 5 year old and 6 year old at a bus stop, a 15 year old at bus stop, a 14 year old in a synagogue, a 16 year old and his older brother yesterday and then filmed their bodies as they mocked them.
And that's just the children they have killed this year.
I'm surprised nothing as large as this has happened before.
I guess Palestinians killing two civilians, filming their bodies mocking them, then dancing in the street.. crossed a line.
Still, cars can be replaced.
Let's be thankful that the settlers have not copied the Palestinians and started shooting at Palestinian civilians at bus stops, restaurants or stabbing them to death in their bedrooms.
But yes, let's talk about Israel's moral advantage because the Palestinians sure are winning on that front /s.
Again, I don't support the settlemsnts, but you surely can see the difference between "builds houses on contested territories" to"pays people to murder random civilians".
You are talking about building on contested territories as if they are free.
They are not; before the building settlers remove previous owners, often violently.
They danced in the street and celebrated the murder of children, uploading it to social media.
Not all of them are terrorists but a large amount of them vocally support and celebrate it.
Russian Jews were actively participating in revolutionary movement which in that time included quite a lot of terror of different kinds.
This are literally spontanous riots done in response to the murder of 2 children from their community and the celebration of these murders in the palestinian village.
Vigilantism is wrong and these riots are abhorrent, but you are actively ignoring reality and a big part of this conflict.
