Wha?
I feel someone must have run in, grabbed one and put it in a cup until help comes, not sure who that would be.
Like marine biologists that get a call and are, “Let’s go, we’ve been preparing for this our whole lives…” Maybe Aquaman.
So fun fact, there is a video game called ECO with online servers that utilises a list of banned words by default.
It has your usual curse words and offensive phrases and fit some unknown reason, that phrase right there.
Guess they weren't taking any chances.
I just read that in the tanks below this main one, though they lost power, many of the rare and endangered species were saved and brought to the zoo.
(Hurray!
).
You saw that, cool.
Maybe you missed this part: "Einige überlebende Fische wurden in einer Wasserschale am Fahrstuhl gefunden.
".
That’s a good idea.
I am thinking some engineer making the Titanic pitch of it being indestructible.
I guess I see people pouring water on fish that get beached so I imagine some emergency procedures being done but I think I watch too much SpongeBob.
There was no clambulance that came.
.
Aw man, that’s horrible.
Though looking up how a parrotfish looks like (surprise, they look like a parrot- their mouth looks like a beak), I also read this: Are Parrotfish good eating?
Parrotfish are typically great eating with lovely, soft white flesh.
It is considered a delicacy in many parts of the world.
In Polynesia, it is served raw and was once considered "royal food," only eaten by the king!
I mean, if it’s dead and frozen….
Furthermore, several hundreds of fish, which were in smaller aquariums in the building, could be rescued, which were in danger of dying due to the power failure.
Yes, I am a dumbass about details since the scene is a mess and it’s saltwater fish.
I just was hopeful that they were able to save one and put it in a tank called “Only survivor of the Berlin aquarium collapse” or something like that.
Poor fishies.
