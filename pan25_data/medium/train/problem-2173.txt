China's vaccination is not recognized by Japan and Taiwan for that matter.
While people from other countries using any one of the MRNA or Astra Zeneca vaccines would get the ability not to quarantine after arriving when they were still requiring a 7 day quarantine.
China requires the same thing from all foreigners, but when countries demand this of China, the Chinese government accuses them of being racist.
Do the Chinese government not understand the meaning of hypocrisy?
The CCP hates losing face more than they hate being wrong and they're part of the ignorant elite who believes "our shit don't stink".
They claim that they weren't responsible for spreading covid the first time, so they're making up for it now.
they also claimed their vaccine is superior and refuse the help when US and Taiwan offered their vaccines, which we all know delayed the recovery time in China by a lot.
Japan used to require both sides of the travel.
Before you leave you need an officially recognized test.
That's pricy in lots of countries.
Then when you arrive, they have pictures of sour fruit on a wall while you spit into a tube.
Then you need another test before you leave which you had to pay for in Japan and that's just as pricy as whatever country you came from.
Then you would have to quarantine if you didn't have a valid vaccination passport.
No exception even if you are Japanese.
China not having a valid vaccination of any sort is the reason they must do this again.
Japan has always been accommodating but at the same time safe.
China is a spoiled child as usual.
