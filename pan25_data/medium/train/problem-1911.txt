He will be welcomed with open arms in Florida.
He’s besties with trump, Desantis is their governor, Rick Scott is one of their senators, and a good portion of FLs citizens are fucking insane or insanely stupid (I have family and friends that live throughout the state, from FT Myers to Palm Beach Gardens, so I can confirm based on my little knowledge personally that this is true).
Yeah, the only bright spot is I live by Chicago, Indianapolis is a dead/boring/lifeless city in comparison (I know Chicago has its issues, but I’d rather live there than Indy).
There are eight states I will never live in.
Florida is at the top of that list.
I have family down there and they are all loony as fuck.
Edit: For clarification my job had me move a lot for a few years.
They tried to send me to Florida.
I threatened to quit and they sent someone else.
That person was killed while there.
I stand by my choices.
Yeah.
At least they are getting their finances under control.
I just won’t live in Kansas due to family being there and they are all evil little Christian Nationalist shit stains.
The family not the whole state.
