Gotta have gas and the world is a crazy place.
But, remember this when you’re buying a FIFA licensed one love armband.
It’s always about the money.
Rare is the person that can really afford principles.
India is chosing to buy cheap oil from russia for the sake of having cheap oil to grow their industry with.
Germany is chosing the lesser of two evils for the sake of keeping an essential resource in stock, without which the economy and the people would suffer immensely.
I can name multiple countries in different continents that are worse than Russia.
If illegal war is what makes a country terrible, then the US sits atop that list.
How many civilians died in Iraq as a result of the American occupation?
Over a million.
I get it.
You're on the internet and nuance isn't your thing.
And because you'd rather be an edgy teenager than debate the nuances of options of how to source massive amounts of natural gas you'd rather just say Qatar = Russia.
Hell, just look at Africa if you want examples of worse governments.
Actual genocides occur in Africa, unlike in Ukraine where the MIC wants to promote a forever war so they can continue to sell arms now that the US is out of the middle-east.
When you start describing NK as preferable to Russia, you lose credibility as it is clear you have lost your mind.
The reason I say something is because i see it as a duty to push back against the common narrative, especially when it is wrong.
To describe the current war in Ukraine as a genocide is frankly moronic when you compare it to previous examples.
Virtually every major country has committed a genocide in it's history.
The British, the Japanese, Chinese, Americans, Germans, Dutch, etc.
