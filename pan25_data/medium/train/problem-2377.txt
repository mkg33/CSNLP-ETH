Bulbing onions are day-lenh sensitive; their bulbs begin growing only after the number of daylight hours has surpassed some minimal quantity.
Most traditional European onions are referred to as "long-day" onions, producing bulbs only after 14 hours or more of daylight occurs.
Southern European and North African varieties are often known as "intermediate-day" types, requiring only 12–13 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation.
"Short-day" onions, which have been developed in more recent times, are planted in mild-winter areas in the autumn and form bulbs in the early spring, and require only 11–12 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation.
[60] Onions are a cool-weather crop and can be grown in USDA zones 3 to 9.
[61] Hot temperatures or other stressful conditions cause them to "bolt", meaning that a flower stem begins to grow.

The people were confused.
They had never heard of onions!
It happened to be that the man had onions on his boat.
He found them among the wreckage, brought them ashore, showed the people how to cook with them, and their minds were just absolutely blown.
He taught them how to grow onions, and this man became an overnight celebrity on this island.
The king invited him to the palace and thanked him profusely for showing his people the way of the onion.
He told him that he would provide a new ship for the man to get himself back home, and to thank him for teaching them his oniony ways, he filled a large basket to the brim with gold and presented it to the man.
