It's no longer possible to determine in anything resembling the timespan of a normal online interaction on a comment thread, for example.
You'd likely need, say, 10 comments/messages exchanged or more to be able to definitively tell (and that's based on currently publicly available models.
Who knows what Google has -- we know fairly little about the performance of models like LaMDA and PaLM beyond what Google wants us to see.)
When this knowledge permeates society and becomes conventional wisdom, I'd imagine online forums and other casual forms of online communication (I.e.
forums not somehow anchored in the real world through a real group, or populated by people known personally to you) will be in for some trouble.
Assuming captchas or potentially personal online IDs become commonplace.
I'm hoping for the former, but who can say?
I don't see how they can really monetize it like they have with google though.
It would immediately turn me away.
I'm sure they really wanted that data they got from letting the world use it for as long as we did.
I cannot imagine how valuable that truly is combined with their targeted marketing algorithms and personal spreadsheet on every living human being.
