Im curious, what is yours (and other residents) opinions of him over all?
All ive heard is that he was a trump critic who just so happens to win in a heavily blue state so is he truly a moderate republican?
I am a hardcore democrat but I voted for him in his last election 4 years ago.
He is definitely moderate.
As mentioned in the article, he also refused to endorse the Republican nominee for Governor for this year’s race because that guy is batshit crazy.
I like Hogan.
He’s definitely moderate.
I wouldn’t vote for him if he ran for President over whoever the Democrat is, but if he ended up winning I wouldn’t lose a minute of sleep over it.
