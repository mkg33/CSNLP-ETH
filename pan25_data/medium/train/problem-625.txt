The ANC, the party in power, has a very long history going back to the days of the USSR.
The ANC has their roots in African Socialism, which isn't really directly compatable with Soviet Communism, but put them enough on the same side during the cold war to make them good proxies for the USSR in Africa.
The USSR supported them to varying degrees for much of the Cold War.
This doesn't mean South Africa as a nation has a strong connection to Russia today, just that there is something of a residual familiarity.
Furhtermore, South Africa is part of the BRICS group (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), a loose economic coalition that is seen as the primary rival to the G7.
This puts their economic interests aligned with those nations, to a certain degree.
Of course, South Africa is also a large trading partner with many western nations.
So they position themselves between the sides.
Also, South Africa has some of the world's richest deposits of chromium.
Chromium is a critical ingredient in making armor plating for tanks and warships.
