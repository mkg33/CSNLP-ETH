The government made striking illegal, so unions threatened a general strike.
The government blinked and backed down to citizen pressure, as they god damned well should.
The union was trying to negotiate for higher wages and the government gave them a lowball offer to get them to go away.
Obviously the union wasn't ok with this and continued to negotiate but the government wouldn't budge and so to force them to take the offer they attempted to make striking illegal.
Just a minor clarification, they didn’t “try” to make striking illegal, they did make striking illegal (and it continues to be until they rescind the law).
To add, the striking union just decided they didn’t care and other unions were preparing to strike in protest as well (my own union successfully passed a strike vote last night).
If they had continued to insist on the legislation, they were looking at public service walk outs across the province.
This is an incredibly confusing headline.
Why would there be a union to end Ontario?
And why would education workers be there?
Edit: Ok I got it, the union is ending the walkout...
I'm slow this morning.
Still a bad headline so I'm leaving my comment.
