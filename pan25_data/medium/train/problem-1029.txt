It's from a few months ago.
Very disturbing stuff.
They locked people inside their homes against their will and started giving them food through drones.
The food was scarce and some times not good to eat.
Edit: I’m not meaning that country’s backward thinking government.
I mean the free thinking individuals.
The government tries to control protests by changing their health code app to red which means they are not allowed to go out or do anything in society.
At this point, alot of people are willing to consider... fuck it, and break out of the lockdown areas on their own accord and ignore such security measures.
In Urumqi, Xinjiang province (where they lock up Muslims, send them to re-education camps , force them to be sterilized), a building caught on fire and the residents could not leave because their doors were locked from the outside (a common covid practice in mainland China).
Urumqi has been under lockdown for more than 100 days.
The mayor and the fire officials blamed the residents essentially for being too slow and also blamed parked cars.
Local people got fucking angry and protested and it was shared among citizens of other cities such as Shanghai which are already angry at countless lockdowns and failures of the government to provide basic necessities.
