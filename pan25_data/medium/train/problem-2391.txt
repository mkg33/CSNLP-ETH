Huh, so a very important and totally civilian weather balloon knowingly gets blown way off-course and no one thinks to tell anyone to call the Americans and tell them to expect some shit to float through their airspace, conveniently floating exactly over some nuclear missile silos?
Keep in mind, Chernobyl happened on a weekend, and the USSR didn't tell anyone because nobody in the West works on the weekends.
This was a serious statement a Soviet representative used when interviewed by Ted Koppel on Nightline.
What happens when the ‚Äúworlds factory‚Äù starts paying their people enough to no longer be attractive and the world switches to another factory üè≠ .
China's labor is actually starting to get expensive in the grand scheme of things, cost per hour is currently cheaper in Mexico, India, and lost of SE Asia.

Best thing we all can do to shut down and suppress the Chinese nonesense, is take our businesses elsewhere, and watch them desolve back to where they were.
it‚Äôs far from a right, It‚Äôs a privilege that they have disrespected, they should be begging to keep their customers happy.
Just a bad and nasty supplier to be shut down.
