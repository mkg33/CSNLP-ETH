I used to think DeSantis would be the ultra-bigot he's been for a few years now because that's the only way he can peel off Trump's hardcore base, and then he would pivot (and the media loves a pivot) towards but not entirely to moderate GOP politics to pull in those centrist leaning voters, after all he played up his moderate-ness in his first govern's run to unfortunately great success.
But, he has gone so far down the full-on bigot, racist, misogynist rabbit hole I don't think there's any returning and even the media seems to be finally catching on to what a monster he is.
He's finally being true to who he really is and it's ugly, just hope enough people catch on in time.
The main thing stopping trump when he was president and even if he becomes president again is the sheer incompetence from him and the people he has in his circles.
Desantis is competent for all the horrible things he also is.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
I hope trump wins the gop nom again just for that reason.
And that the Dems elect someone who is more bold than Biden who can somehow reach through to the working classes across the nation.
Desantis is far from competent…people are just scared because he went to Harvard.
The dude can’t even pass a law that won’t get struck down because he’s too focused on culture war bullshit.
