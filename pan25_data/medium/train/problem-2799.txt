I don’t disagree here, however Kazakhstan at the very least has already been shipping oil/gas (I don’t specifically remember which natural resource it was) through to Azerbaijan, while I don’t like Azerbaijan too much (mainly their government) it can be a big step in the right direction away from Russia for multiple countries.
Especially if Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan want to move away from Russias influence, and recent times suggest they do, especially Kazakhstan moving away from the Cyrillic alphabet in favour of the Latin alphabet.
I’m willing to bet neither want to be in partnership with Russia when they can do better without them.
A Union, yes.
It can be controlled by councils of workers, in a social manner.
If it does well it could be it's own republic.
Excellent, yes, a united soviet socialist repu.....wait a minute.
And with Russias weakening global position both politically and militarily the threat of an invasion like Ukraine isn’t as likely, and they know they’d get support from western backed countries in the same event.
