I can't wait for the world where retirees get de-aged and dead people get resurrected so they can go back to work for minimum wage for one more lifetime.
What a time to be alive.
They've had the same idea floating around since the 50s and from a bit of googling the first person they tried to freeze to resurrect was in the 60s.
So yeah, same shit new article.
I heard Clooney bought the rights to one of the episodes to make a movie.
1st season with the eye implants.
My favorite was the guy who was charged with a crime and gets blanked out of everyone's vision as a punishment.
Imagine signing up for this shit and then the next thing you know you come back aware but with no body or inputs, in a black void with occasional strange/painful sensations as the company tests shit by zapping your brain in a jar.
The horror.
Just die with dignity.
Reminds me of the Doctor Who episode where dead people's souls were still connected to their bodies and they were desperately trying to tell people not to cremate them because they could feel it.
