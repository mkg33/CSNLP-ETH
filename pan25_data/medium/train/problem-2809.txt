Seems like a completely reasonable request.
I canâ€™t see any reason Ukraine would break the security guarantee and lead to a war that could stretch for years.
Putin could always give up Russia's nuclear weapons in exchange for a security guarantee that Ukraine will not invade them and protect their territorial integrity.
"Speaking with members of the presidential Human Rights Council, Putin described the land gains as "a significant result for Russia," noting that the "Sea of Azov has become Russia's internal sea."
He added that "Peter the Great fought to get access to the Sea of Azov.
"".
yes.
If Russia did this and did not officially have 7k nuclear warheads, NATO would have gotten involved.
In the end, on paper, Russia can cause enough civilian casualties in NATO nations that it would not be worth it for NATO to even consider putting boots on the ground.
Seems like a good deterrence to me.
He's desperate for anything he can call a success.
What is he going to do when Russia loses Mariupol?
