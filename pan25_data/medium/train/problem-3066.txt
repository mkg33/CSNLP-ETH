Moscow isn't going to commit suicide anymore than Washinon D.C. is.
Putin may be crazy enough to issue the order (which I personally doubt, but whatever), but Russians down the chain of command would not carry it out.
They would either ignore it or remove Putin from power to save their own lives.
They're not going to kill themselves and Russia just over a territorial dispute that may go their way if they try again in the future.
Russian understanding of history is long.
“They’ll be consequences if…sanctions, assisting citizens leaving Ukraine, foreign aid, provision of weapons”… So what’s the straw that breaks the camel’s back, Russia?

How about the likelihood that your leader is dead?

From the dozens of KA-52 that have been shot down in Ukraine, I think there have been only two cases where the ejection system was used, both times saving only one of the two crewmen.
