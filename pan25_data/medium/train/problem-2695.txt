The funny thing about that wording is it doesn't say the science isn't there.
It doesn't say we dont know or haven't done the research.
Scientists and hard-working students slaving away at their PhD theses rarely are the problem.
The politicians and the corporations pulling the strings on funding almost always are.
Engineers and project managers aren’t the problem.
The cocaine-fueled executives forcing management to follow inane orders are the problem.
It’s a pattern in life everywhere I look, the people in power crushing down the ones below them with steel-toed boots.
It’s true that if someone is driven enough to seek power at all costs, they would also be the worst kind of person to possess that power.
The WHO is proposing drinking water limits of 100 parts per trillion (ppt) for PFOA and PFOS, two of the most studied PFAS compounds.
The letter’s signatories say the level will put human health at risk, and the EPA in June imposed new PFOA and PFOS advisory limits of 0.004 ppt and 0.02 ppt, respectively.
The agency is expected to make the limits mandatory in the coming months, and some researchers suspect the WHO is aiming to derail that effort.
Holy fuck, our local ground water guidelines for 'safe levels' of PFOS and PFHxS is set at 0.07micrograms/l.... 70000ppt!
Doctors/nurses/EMTs are not the problem.
The administrative officials are the problem, the higher-ups who create sleep-deprived zombies out of a nation’s brightest medical minds.
We really need to come up with something better to drop out of planes - land area vulnerable to seasonal fires is only growing by the year and the bigger the fires, the more you gotta drop on them to try stop them spreading.
How many people must live in fire-prone areas in California, Australia, parts of Canada... and how many more each year will have their local lands drenched in the stuff come fire season.
Not to mention all the animals living there.
Grazing lands, hunting lands, watersheds running to rivers and oceans.
