Not a lawyer (just some guy that took one class on german constitutional law in uni), but if it was possible to give out blanc cheque's when it comes to arms exports regulations, that legislation would not make any sense.
The only country pressuring Germany to send Leopard 2 tanks, except Ukraine, was Poland.
Finland said that they would take part in a coalition to send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine but did not request anything.
Nobody sent anything which Scholz could approve, not even Poland, which couldn't stop saying 'Germany is dragging their feet!'
without doing the bare necessities themselves.
Dragging their feet on what?
Dragging their feet on the non-existent Polish re-export request?
There are upcoming elections in Poland and the PiS government wants to stirr up the voter base, for gods sake.
And it all works all to well with thousand of people buying into this 'Germany is standing in front of a coalition of dozens of nations They are hampering the war efforts alone Enemies of Ukraine!'
BS.
