I really hate this take and take every opportunity I see it to make a correction.
It feels almost like Russian propaganda.
We Poles are not some bloodthirsty idiots just itching to attack Russia at the slightest excuse.
Our general approach to Russia is that it should go fuck itself and leave us alone.
We don't want to go to any war.
Nobody thinks you are (okay, maybe the person you're responding to is, but in general...).
But we still remember the talk of potentially swapping MiG-29s for F-35s.
Trading out the aged 80s hardware for something from this millennia.
It didn't happen but it was a huge debate for months.
And let's be real, at this point if your message is "Russia, leave us the fuck alone," it pays to have some top of the line hardware.
If they're stupid enough to try a NATO country, it needs to be as painful as possible as quickly as possible.
I think one of the big things about this invasion is that European countries that used to be afraid of Russia aren't anymore.
We've all seen what they're capable of, but even more so we've seen what they're _not_ capable of.
