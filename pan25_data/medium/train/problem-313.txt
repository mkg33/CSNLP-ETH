Goblin mode is described as “a type of behaviour which is unapologetically self-indulgent, lazy, slovenly, or greedy, typically in a way that rejects social norms or expectations".
Many romantic languages has genders applied to nouns, which is aggravating since a chair and a table have no genitals and thus do not need gendered identifiers.
The whole silent letters (looking at you: French) is ridiculous and also needs to go.
“Drive-Thru”is accepted and no one makes the throaty noise for the end of “through” any more, so might as well save people the three letters.
This would demolish written French as we know it, but I want neither of them to be the language of the future (and they are the two languages I know the most).
I majored in this language and I earned the right to hate it.
I look forward to whatever genderless replacement we get, even if it is “doubleplusgood” at this point.
Aye, I see that now.
The three choices were a bit shit this year, also 'Goblin Mode' is two words and 'IStandWith' is three, so technically 'Metaverse' should have been the only choice.
