Mate, the goal is if you commit a crime like park in a red zone without giving a fuck, for poor/middle class people that's gonna hurt your wallet and will not repeat, for rich it's a subscription and will repeat with flat fine.
With income percentage, for every class it's going to hurt your wallet and you are not going to commit the crime again.
That's the goal of tickets to not do something stupid.
If you want to talk about cops that's a whole different story.
Income Percentage fines should become standard, because if they are rich or poor, it'll fuck them over either way.
But bet rich will heavily lobby against it as income percentage fine will force the rich to abide by the laws.
