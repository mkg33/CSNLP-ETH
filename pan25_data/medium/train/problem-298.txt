\- encouraged people to reach out to younger voters, especially 18-24, they are the least likely to vote.
\- encouraged people yesterday and today to think about down ballot races.
Even if they were discouraged by the big races, they could still get behind local issues like more bike lanes and better transit options.
Hoping to get people out that don't plan to.
I only regret not discussing down ballot voting sooner.
The reality is that a chunk of people are disinterested in politics, maybe because they have people pressuring them in their families, etc.
But connecting with them on local interests might stir up more interest.
I also wish i knew more people in swing states.
I would have liked to do more in that area.
Or at least nudge people there.
