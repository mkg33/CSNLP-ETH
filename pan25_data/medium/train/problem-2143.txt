"Friends!
Congratulating each other on the anniversary, we wish success to each of us, and to all of us together.
Our people need this success because today, the information work – in the conditions, in which we live and fight for our country – is like a combat weapon.
And in terms of importance, it is in no way inferior to a Kalashnikov assault rifle.

Nah, it was mostly stolen as well, just to a lesser extent I suppose.
Also you can kinda make propaganda work even without too many resources by using cheap labor and whatnot, but you can't make good tanks and even more so good aviation if you have a tiny fraction of the assigned budget.
Take my words with a tablespoon of salt, though, I'm purely speculating (except for the part where they stole money).
Granted, Russia did spend more money on RT than it spend on ‘tanks’ and unlike ‘tank money’ this investment was not mostly stolen but was used in most efficient way.
Alina Kabaeva, the chairwoman of the board of directors of the National Media Group in Russia, has stated at the anniversary events of the group that the activities of propagandists are in no way inferior to military weapons, in particular, the Kalashnikov assault rifle.
Everyone who believes that Russia must be stopped in its genocidal war against Ukrainian people - support Ukraine: ❤️.
