To even be considered a “superpower” you have to have significant externalized influence and dominance in three fields: culture, economy and military.
China has arguably one of those covered (economy) these days, but they have negligible export in culture and a woefully sad military for their economic output.
If you’re fifth or sixth or tenth among highly contested measures, you’re not particularly significant and you’re most assuredly not dominant.
Meanwhile: It takes a few seconds of reviewing the US’ economic output, international purchasing parity influence, multispectrum military dominance and the fact that you can travel anywhere in the world and see someone drinking Coke, wearing jeans, browsing an American government funded worldwide network on an iPhone designed in Cupertino, listening to Billie Eilish waiting for the next Marvel film to see why the US is a superpower.
Americans in general need to understand that Russia and America are going to be enemies/rivals for the foreseeable future.
Everything Russia does involving the US is for the purpose of weakening the US.
Wagner has already stated they have "millions" of Americans "volunteering" to fight in Ukraine.
Any American in Russia urgently needs to understand the implications of this propaganda.
