So so so many 18-45yr olds are just staying here and hoping to not get caught on an overstay for long enough that when they inevitable do get sent home the war will be over.
The only negative I'd have about Phuket was that a lot of the food felt like it was modified to suit a western palate, and beers were watered down.
Otherwise everything was great.
I went last year and I loved it.
The Russians there aren't rude or anything, they're just there doing their thing.
Never had a negative encounter.
I even met a Belarusian guy who was hiding out there, he was nice.
He also directed me to a nice Thai-Aussie hippie dude who sold me weed.
Unfortunately I'm from Singapore and our government has made a big fuckin deal about how we aren't allowed to take drugs overseas when Thailand legalised.
I've heard of people ending up in prison or state enforced rehab because they've smoked overseas and got caught at the airport with residual cannabinoid metabolites hiding in their fat cells.
Some of the stupidest shit ever and it really pisses me off that people are still getting executed for bringing pot into my country.
