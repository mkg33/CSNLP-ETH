"An IDF statement later on Monday said according to initial findings, Zakarneh had been near gunmen who had opened fire on troops and thrown explosives and Molotov cocktails at them from roofs in the area.
".
IDF didn't know which roofs exactly the gunmen were on, they shot who they saw.
The roof she was on was of her family's house.
"Zakarneh's uncle, Yasser, said she had gone up to the roof to fetch her cat but never came back, AFP news agency reported.
".
There are pictures of that girl filming the IDF soldiers.
Just shows you that like others said - "witnesses" can lie.
Edit: you know what?
I'll give them the benefit of the doubt - maybe they didn't lie.
Maybe she truly got upstairs just to get the cat...but in the end - she stayed there to film them, and that what matters.
I would even argue that it's more plausible that it's a regular soldier, since she was hit four times - something that snipers usually don't do, as far as I know, or at least would be hard since she should have fallen.
