When I see “Marines” from any country suffer casualties like this in a single mission I know there’s an issue (USMC here).
The USMC initially mimicked the British Royal Marines to create our marines.
Marines in any country are a critical part of operations for many reasons but a huge one is their flexibility.
These are skilled and professional soldiers that usually aren’t routed like this.
Their marines, paratroopers and other spec ops members were indeed in the category of top tier operators.
But now?
Training and ability don’t mean shit when you’ve got “leaders” that are tossing their best into a meat grinder while in the safety of being in the rear.
Real leaders want to know wtf is going on.
Not rah-rah shit while sending your boys to certain death.
But the unfortunate reality is that young men die in war that old men started.
It’ll be decades, if at all, that they can replace the talent they’ve so carelessly thrown away and that, not unfortunately, is a good thing for the world.
What's even more cynical is that in many cases (Syria being a perfect recent example other than Russia) is that these men are also some of the most hardcore loyalists to the regime, so the prize for being trained, reliable and loyal is to be sent to battle after battle after battle until the unit is depleted and/or ceases to exist.
