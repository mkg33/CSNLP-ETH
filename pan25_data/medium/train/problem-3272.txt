I'm not saying I don't want those things.
They are vital.
I am saying that those methods of transportation are rising in cost and many people can't afford electric vehicles.
I agree but it's kind of implied since everyone knows what they mean and it's the same date as what California is doing with new car sales.
Since that goes with the year/manufacturing date etc.
It's a nice thing on paper but we really should workout the kinks in electric vehicles.
Esp performance in cold temperatures and range issues plus battery storage and the need to mine rare earth metals to build the batteries to begin with.
I think the first thing you should list is to figure out is the massive increase in grid demand that would be associated with everyone and their mother having an electric car that charges from the grid.
Problem is costs of trains and mass transit are rising yearly.
I literally know people who had to look for new work closer to home because train travel ate into a significant chunk of their earnings and driving isn't an option because parking near their job was like 14Â£ per day in the UK.
Similar cost rises are present in most EU nations.
