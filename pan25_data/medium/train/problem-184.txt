We are just currently tittering in a valley of instability.
Historically human labour is so valuable that they get paid well.
And in the future productivity can be so high that we can maintain minimum quality of life for all citizens in a functioning country.
A lot of the culture war posts and conversations are precipitated by bad actors, bots, and the media.
It is why we are constantly inundated with it, and why tools like Chat GPT are being pushed into the limelight, as they give said bad actors the chance to inundate us even further with more of the same automstically.
I wish more of us could see it for what it is so that we could all actually get on the same page and organize against the aristocracies that are controlling us with these tricks and tools, but sadly more people are pulled into the fake bullshit than see through it.
But right now human labour is barely priced at starvation wages, while productivity isn't high enough to sustain everyone automatically.
We just need to hold on for a few more generations.
