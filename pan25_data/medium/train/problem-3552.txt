Seriously.
Life has felt dramatically different in that time span, could just be my age and really kinda realizing things as an adult, I guess.
But even beyond that it definitely feels fucky as hell.
I see and hear about what my parents did, and think.
It's right there in the name.
It's a plot by the oil companies to make us hate environmentalists and keep buying gas.
"no fuckin way.
1) you couldn't do that in that way today AND.
2) you were 5 years younger than I am now when you did that?
".
Everything feels so freaking uncertain, it's hard to plan for my future and, y'know, BE certain about anything.
I feel like I haven't had any good 1-5-10 year plans or goals in so fuckin long because of how they kept just falling apart in some seriously astonishing fashion.
People point that to a sign that the group is a false flag, but that is ridiculous.
Just like Walt Disney's great niece (Roy's granddaughter) publicly calls out Disney for how they treat employees, a descendant can be wealthy from inherited wealth from oil and speak out against it.
It is slightly more hypocritical than just giving all their inheritance away, but it is better than nothing.
