Wasn't the point of conservatives to... conserve what they already have?
If they were indigenous people I'd understand but this?
It should be considered treason by any conservative.
And there is already a lawsuit by the First Nations in Alberta because it infringes on Treaty rights.
The claim alleges the Act infringes on the rights of Onion Lake members to pursue traditional ceremonies, associations and way of life (hunting, fishing, trapping) because it seems to circumvent the original agreements in place between First Nations and the Crown.
It further alleges the Act negates the guarantees of livelihood and freedom that Treaty 6 was made to protect.
And, it claims, their rights are being derogated (relaxed or made exempt) by substituting treaty agreements for the “fiat” of the Lieutenant Governor.
I live in Alberta and this is a stupid move by a far right fringe group to pander to their increasingly small fringe base.
Unfortunately, that fringe group is currently in control of the provincial government.
Luckily, there will likely be a provincial election in the spring, and there is a decent chance this move will cost them control.
The vast majority of actual conservatives in the province think this is a ridiculous waste of time and resources instead of actually supporting businesses.
Many are talking about shifting their vote to the NDP instead, whose leader seems to have an actual brain in her head.
