The Republican brand is destroyed.
To me...it's now the party of an authoritarian dictatorship...racism.. xenophobia...anti science and global warming, anti-vax and overall health (looks how they treated the pandemic)...anti student loans and anti-holding millionaires tax accountable.....anti-women's rights...anti-separation of church and state....a party full of liars, cheats, insanity, and absolutely no accountability.
They are the anti-American party to me now.....something from out of the 40s and 50s.
It's a party with no diversity, no plan, no solutions, and no future.
Democracy just showed that most in the US feel the same way about the Republican party.
