Yea IIRC they had to redraft part of their Constitution/repeal an article because when they reformed their government after WW2 they agreed on a non-aggression clause outlawing war as a means of solving disputes and limiting themselves to maintaining defensive forces only.

In reality, Japan will probably never really have to protect itself, at least not alone.
The Navy is really the US' main projection of power, and there's a reason that the US' largest overseas Naval base is located on Tokyo Bay.
It's based on region, both are considered Western Europe and Other and therefore they are the only non-permanent member allowed for those regions.
At least for the forseeable future, they definitely won't have to defend themselves alone.
The US has the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security with Japan.
