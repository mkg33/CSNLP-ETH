I had about 130k to get my masters in communication sciences and disorders.
I did my degree super cheap compared to many of my peers.
I live in Cali, i have a good job, I make a decent wage, it’s just gonna be 10-20 years of paying off loans minimum.
I plan to pay down my debt at the same monthly amount so I can pay down my principal faster.
But I’m not in over my head, so I have that luxury.
I’ve been very fortunate to get as much as I have with as little debt as I have.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
