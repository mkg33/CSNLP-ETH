Based on Kornacki last night, there's sort of a progression of ballots to get through, and probably today and tomorrow we'll see more favorable dumps for Hobbs and Kelly, but then we'll get dumps from same day drop-offs which if are similar to 2020 will benefit the GOP candidates.
There are more ballots in that second group, especially in Maricopa county.
But, the hope is the 2020 pattern is not as strong in 2022.
I'm reasonably optimistic about Kelly, but expect it to be close and think eventually Lake will overtake Hobbs.
I hope I'm wrong about the latter.
