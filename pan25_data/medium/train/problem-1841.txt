Edit: My dad is from Rize, one of the more conservative and religious parts of Turkey.
I’ll be honest, I don’t visit often, but I don’t censor myself when I am there.
He himself is openly atheist and has been for a long time.
It is still not illegal to not wear a veil or a headscarf; many local women do not, and at most, some people might give you weird looks.
If I were to scream out my atheism in public at the wrong part of town, there is a slight possibility I might get a public beating.
People who beat me will still get arrested and prosecuted if I press charges.
E7-E9 have their own segregated area that only they can eat at.
Staffed by E4 and below like waiters, generally have top tier food and cooks.
For the U.S. Army.
A Mess Hall would be enlisted and officers' meal service.
Then there would be an Officers Club and an Enlisted Club for relaxing and drinking.
I think the Navy may segregate the food service.
Officers eat segregated too, they have generally better cooks and weird rules about how to eat and sit.
