The pollster in Kansas (co/efficient) had a really bad read on turnout since the expected turnout for that election was 36% but it ended up being 50%.
So basically the pollster failed to have an accurate voter screen so their poll which had YES at 47 and NO at 43 ended up missing hard.
I wonder do polls capture new registered voters well?
Because if a bunch of new voters are women motivated by abortion they could be underrepresented.
They are well aware that most of their regressive policies are deeply unpopular.
This is why they are starting to refuse public debates.
This is why they are constantly lying, misleading, gerrymandering, suppressing voting, and overturning legitimate elections.
This is why they sabotage education at every opportunity.
