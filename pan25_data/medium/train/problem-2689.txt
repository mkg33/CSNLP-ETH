Well the ambassador can go stay in the Greek Islands, oh I forgot, Greece is Putin's next adversary.
To be fair, Russia hasn’t been a world superpower since it was the Soviet Union.
The world playcated Russia in an effort to see Russia become more modern but when Putin seized power that was never a possibility.
He’s ex-KGB.
He was always going to see the Soviet Union’s downfall as an embarrassment for the Russian people and looked to blame it’s failures on The West.
Like, Bro, if your enemy can made you fail that means you were failures.
Thats how success and failure works.
Should be blatantly obvious.
That is exactly what putin and the old school kgb people belive or at least are trying to sell to their people.
If someone 100 feet tall kept pushing you down, did you really stand a chance?
Was it a fair fight?
Were you just a failure?
Not saying the west kept Russia down, but the west IS a titan compared to Russia, doubly so when the USSR fell apart.
For the record, most of Russia's problems are Russia's fault, but saying that the west could have 0 impact on them failing/succeeding is just wrong.
If someone much more powerful than you decides that they are not going to let you thrive, and has the power to make that a reality, are you a failure or did they fuck you?
Again, I don't agree with it, just pointing out their "logic" isn't flawed, it just isn't based in reality.
If we wanted them to fail, we absolutely could have made that happen.
They just did it for us.
