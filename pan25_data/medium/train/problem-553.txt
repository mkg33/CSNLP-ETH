They’re pushing VR films now, and it will be on the forefront of the next media format tech.
One thing the adult industry has is money to invest in publishing films or content on new technologies, because if it’s a hit it will take off quickly with a quick ROI.
Printing presses were popularized by erotica.
Home video on 16mm and later 8mm was used to film early homemade porn, stag films for bachelor parties, etc.
VHS was pushed by being able to quickly duplicate and distribute, DVD was about generating hi-def and reduced packaging and production costs.
Blu-ray was higher quality, but also denser storage (more porn).
Your internet bandwidth, monthly membership fees, additional service fees all pushed by porn.
You can bet your tits they’ll be investing in the next format.
The biggest hit to traditional porn came during the pandi when OnlyFans took off, going from 12M users in Jan ‘20 to 200M by Aug ‘22.
I’m not sure what the next step will be, but at least 80% of the subscription fees is going to the creators/workers, as opposed to the traditional exploitive format of the actors/actresses.
