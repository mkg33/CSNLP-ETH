Cuba isn’t in a position to do either.
They are clearly still trying to get out from sanctions by the USA and may just be trying to use these talks as leverage to get points from the USA if something good comes from it.
From Russias end it’s probably just a gauge to see if Cuba is still a country it can rely on to be friendly with.
They’ve had great relations for decades after all and recently Russia went and torched all its relationships with a lot of players.
Asking Cuba to accept missiles won’t end Cuban sanctions anytime soon and Russia doesn’t want to give America a reason to escalate its involvement with Ukraine anymore then it already has.
Cuba also doesn’t have enough resources that it could send to assist Russia in the scale they’d need it considering it’s been under sanctions for the past 60 years.
2) The far more likely, it's to ask if Cuba can supply them with any equipment, including military and medical.
Cuba will probably say they're in no position to, and that Russia can't offer them anything substantial in return.
For people saying that option 1 is more likely — I'm sure Russia realizes that pointing missiles at the US again will be provocation worthy of an armed response, and very likely cause Article 4 to be invoked.
