Yup.
The nytimes podcasts either did an interview or showed an interview of a new recruit who got sent to the grinder and was injured but his mates died (when they were told they were going on a training mission) and I’m paraphrasing but were basically like “yea it sucks, we know we got lied to as well, but it’s our duty to our country/people.” I got a sense from the interview that there was a historic /cultural aspect to this as well.
Like they aren’t to first Russians to get sent to the grinder, and they won’t be the last.
My family plays that you can put down whatever you want.
Anyone can challenge it if they want to.
If it isn't in the Scrabble dictionary then you lose a turn, if it is in the dictionary then the person who challenged you incorrectly loses a turn.
“Earlier, it was reported that the wives of the killed occupiers from the "DPR" [self-proclaimed and non-recognised Donetsk People's Republic in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine – ed.]
received 21 fur coats.
The widows of the killed have lined up in the video in order to express their gratitude for "help".
The voiceover stated that fur coats were provided by "Russian activists".
