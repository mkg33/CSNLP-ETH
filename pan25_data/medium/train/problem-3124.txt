It never fails to be infuriating that republicans oppose bills that anyone with common sense and a belief in equality should support.
They try to overturn elections, they try to block people from voting, and they get more authoritarian by the day.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
But that’s the thing.
They know they are doing this intentionally and they are tricking their base (whom is already racist or ignorant as is) that this is the right move.
Republicans have been outwardly hostile towards minorities for so long that if a republican politician isn’t, they are accused of being a RINO.
They haven’t tricked millennials or Gen Z whom have diverse friend groups or who have allowed the internet to show them the powers of diversity.
The Republican Party is desperately trying to cling into an older demographic that is still holding on after so many were lost to COVID denial.
This is, hopefully, the death rattle of the extremist Republican Party as we know it today.
But as we are all aware, anything in power that is dying will fight violently to maintain its control.
So I think these “alt-right” repubs will make it worse before it gets better.
