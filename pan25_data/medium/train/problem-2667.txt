This one thing would not only secure good jobs and increase taxes paid to the treasury but it would make the UK independent for energy.
Tbh this has been a culmination of years of a weak recovery from 2008, austerity, wage squeezes and deteriorating living conditions, all while Brexit is the gift that keeps on giving.
The effects of the pandemic (lack of world preparedness, production disruptions, etc), painfully high inflation (also caused by Russia invading Ukraine) and subsequent effects is the last straw for most.
Then actually building council owned homes , at least a million of them over 10 years would also create many jobs in so many areas of the economy.
Solal panels on every roof, manufactured in the UK creating many good jobs and then a battery for at minimum 3 days power storage in every home to boost the new battery manufacturing possibilities in the UK.
The UK is relatively energy independent anyway, least not reliant on Russia for oil and gas.
Most of it comes from the North Sea whether via Norway or our own fields (just that we privatised the entire supply chain so now we gotta pay market price).
In the UK there hasn't been anything much to feel good about for ages.
The mood of the country is just pessimistic right now.
Has been for awhile.
