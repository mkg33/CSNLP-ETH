Bro if you think are doddering old corn pop of a president is "stopping" anything then I question your attentiveness Russia is still grinding thousands of conscripts into dust trying to stop Ukrainian 2.0 from retaking it's pre war borders untill winter grinds everything to a halt.
Both Russia and Ukrainian for all intents and purposes are cut off from supplying the global food and energy markets while this war continues.
And people do need that food and energy, in places like ow i dont know name an Africa country.
So skyguy (nice starwars reference btw) what will Biden do next?
I think nothing but that's just my theory.
