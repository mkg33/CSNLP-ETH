Everyone was really fucking quick to recognize Lula.
Leaders from all over the world congratulated Lula right after he won, and the same happened with political leaders within our country (even some of Bolsonaro’s allies).
I take it you're from Brazil, so correct me if you disagree with my take here, but given this outcome with the military and the fact he was completely silent after the result leads me to believe he was holding out hope the military would make some sort of indication of support or move to support him, and when he realized it wasn't forthcoming he realized he had no choice but to concede.
And to illustrate how much of a close call it was, 5 days ago CNN Brazil published an article saying that 2 of the 3 armed force branches wanted to support Bolsonaro's intention of judicializing the election results.
This idea only died because the Army, which is the only of the three branches with real political power, did not want anything to do with it.
As an American, with the fragility of our democracy, I'm glad you averted any potential disaster and that democracy continues to exist in Brazil.
May it only strenhen in the future.

Bolsonaro is (not yet confirmed) going through health issues, related to a leg infection.
Still unclear, but some suspect Erysipelas.
I don’t think it’s life threatening at all, but he’ll need to go through a recovery period.
He’s not been doing much as of late.
That makes sense, thanks for confirming.
Didn't mean to reduce it to just one thing.
This sort of quasi-palace intrigue is normally the culmination of many things.
Brazilian here.
This is a fairly accurate assessment.
There's one other factor, there were still some (not exactly spontaneous as some investigations are starting to show) protests going on from his supporters in front of army bases, hoping to pressure the military.
His silence was being seen as a way of supporting the protests without explicitly incurring in any crimes.
