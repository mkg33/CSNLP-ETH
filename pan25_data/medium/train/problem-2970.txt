Here's a clip of Biden lying about a bunch of things in response to somebody questioning his IQ during his 1988 presidential campaign.
He obviously didn't win this election and after it came out that he was lying, he was held accountable for his lies and dropped out of the race: .
The clip is from a conservative channel that seems to pretend Democrats are allowed to lie, Republicans are not, but clearly Biden dropped out of a presidential campaign after all his lies were shown to the people, while absolutely nothing has been done to hold Santos accountable.
The GOP should give Santos the boot and put somebody in his position that has some integrity.
Biden....I think 35 years is enough time to recoup from lies, but I think 2024 is going to be a rough one for him.
