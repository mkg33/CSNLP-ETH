The fact that there are any RepubliKKKans still claiming to support “freedom” is one of the great ironies of our time.
The same people who laugh at citizens in countries like NK and call them brainwashed by the govt will tell you in the very next sentence why we need the pledge in school every morning and keeping your hat on during the national anthem should be punishable by death.
So, the Trump 2024 campaign's first --and, so far, only-- stated public policy position is a platform of support for unrestrained disinformation?
Good luck with that!
