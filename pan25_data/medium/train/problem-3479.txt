I know that Russia continually reminds us that their country has the ability to precipitate world destruction.
And we would risk nuclear war with such a provocative statement.
But I am convinced that the explanation for the continuous and innumerable threats are evidence of their impotence.
And I do not believe the Russian military would follow orders to launch a preemptive nuclear attack.
Shoigu: "Mr. Putin, it appears Greece is going to send Ukraine S-300 air defense systems.... what do we do?
".
Russia's blustering has reached the point of absurdity.
If I were advising strategy for the U.S. & Europe, I would contend that they are indeed a paper tiger, and to call their bluff.
For every announcement that Russia makes threatening vague, but grave consequences for the support of a NATO country, (like releasing video of an icbm missle with multiple warheads being loaded into a silo), I would counter with a brief and consistment statement which states NATO will continue to provide any support they deem fit to assist Ukraine to regain their illegally annexed land.
Period.
