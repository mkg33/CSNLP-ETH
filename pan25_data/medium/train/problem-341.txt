I don't think anyone uploading this has actually read it.
There is nothing in the article corresponding to this headline.
This is the headline, but if there was any content in the article for that headline, it's been removed.
What it says is that Ukraine won't discuss plans of this nature, and explains why they won't.
It's literally just the wrong headline.
Russia doesn't respect them, but they do like them.
It conveniently puts all the civilians into a smaller area so their not-very-precise artillery can be more effective at the slaughter.
It would be good strategy to give them a green corridor if they leave all their weapons and equipment behind.
Untrained conscripts are worth less to Russia right now than the massive equipment they stockpiled in Kherson back when Ukraine bluffed about their offensive.
But Russia knows this too and is willing to spend as many conscript lives as they need to evacuate some fraction of that equipment intact, that’s why they didn’t even ask for a corridor while they withdraw.
