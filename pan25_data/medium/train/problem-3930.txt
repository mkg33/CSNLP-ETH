Let's introduce a bill banning teachers from discussing or acknowledging religion - including Christianity - with their students.
Just to watch every single one of these legislators have an utter meltdown.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
If a LGBTQ student (or even a non-LGBTQ student with questions) goes to a teacher, does the student get in trouble or does the teacher get in trouble?
On top of the overall ridiculous notion of the bill itself, I don’t understand the banning of students confiding in teachers.
Either way, this is just plain insanity.
Teachers spend generally more waking hours with each child during the week than the child’s parents do.
And we’re just gonna say that they can’t trust their teachers?
