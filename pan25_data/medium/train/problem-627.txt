Idk after seeing the video I saw.
I understand the people who are saying they feel bad for the Russian front lines.
Cry me a river.
Let the lesson be that you send in the heavies, you get heavy offensive.
Scare the new recruits into not joining Wagner.
Recruits need to know that that career move shortens their life expectancy to a few months.
I wish I didn't see that video.. Russia will never be forgiven for what has happened.
But god damn that poor man.
All he got was a jacket.
No medical care.
I think I need a therapist.
As much as I want to feel sorry for the Russian soldiers getting killed on the front lines, I just can't.
They started it.
The Russian people mostly support it.
Most of the soldiers fighting supported it.
They have committed countless war crimes and killed thousands of civilians.
The Wagner Group in particular has been responsible for many war crimes and brutalities.
Any active Russian soldier on Ukrainian soil today is a target and deservedly so.
They've done it to themselves.
