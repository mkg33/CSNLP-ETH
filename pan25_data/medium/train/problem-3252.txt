Ok man you do you.
Move to North Korea or some other high censorship shit hole and find yourself a job telling people what is OK to publish and what not.
Meanwhile the passengers had no clue until the pilot made an announcement because single-engine flight in modern aircraft is manageable.
This is why I hate modern scoop-it-first journalism.

Aviate, navigate, communicate (with ATC), in that order of priority.
Communication with passengers is dead last on the priority list for a damn good reason.
