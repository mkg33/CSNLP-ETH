Are you bringing up Trump so you can blame him instead of Biden?
Those Balloons were not in the air for 3 years.
Ultra Long Duration Balloons can only stay in the air for a few weeks and the US has never sent Spy Balloons into Chinese airspace.
Literally everything you just said is demonstrably false.
This happened during Bidenâ€™s administration and they first noticed the balloon before it made it very far into the air space and they failed to act.
You flew a balloon over Americans and you didn't expect them to shoot at it?
You might as well have sent it to Scotland and been surprised when they deep fried it.
To be fair, the Scottish only started deep frying things after the invention of the deep fat frier.
Prior to that they would have coated it cold porridge.
I guess it is time to float lots of civilian weather balloons over China - of course purely by accident.
And I guess best not to proactively tell them about the purely accidentally off-course balloons until the Chinese start complaining about them.
