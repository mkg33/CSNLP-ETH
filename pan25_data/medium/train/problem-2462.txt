The most recent prior Democratic president was a no-drama, dignified fellow who was called out for the color of his suit.
His wife -- the only one he's ever had -- was repeatedly called a man and vilified for suggesting things like school kids should have access to nutritious meals.
The most recent Republican president, a man who had children with multiple wives he kept cheating on and slept with at least one porn star we know about, constantly berated and even called for the prosecution of people he disagreed with, encouraged people to override legitimate election results for his benefit and apparently wanted to secretly nuke North Korea and blame someone else for it.
Yet, for some reason, this dignity hullabaloo is a "both sides" issue.
