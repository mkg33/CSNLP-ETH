Why would the right wing hate the West, the right wing government has been the most West friendly government we have had, also for the putin support, Indian citizens have a great knack to always pick the worst possible person to rally behind and thankfully our government does not give into that as an example there was immense support for chairman mao in many parts of India(even non communist ones) back in 62, when we were fighting a war with them, there was support for Saddam Hussein during Iraq war (public not governmental), etc.
And i think that is because they have not studied history well enough i mean dumbasses like to repeat the 71 line but forget that from 61 to 67 the US was supporting India, they forget that US has provided a lot of food aid during the early famines and helped in the green revolution.
And the fact that the anti Western narrative was started by the left wing ( Indira Gandhi was a hardline socialist that killed a significant chunk of our private sector that has grown because people even during Nehru's era had realised that market economy is a good idea and were experimenting with it) which these idiots have lapped up.
Both Countries have elections in 2024 , Biden would love to get some Indian American votes that may help him win and Modi who's guaranteed to win just loves to travel and score more dimplomacy PR points.
Whoever you are this guy supports you and would love to come for a tour, just don't be China or Pakistan.
