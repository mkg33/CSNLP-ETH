Wow Vladivostok.
So (jokes aside) is this people that aren’t a fan of Putin’s war and mobilization?
Vladivostok is so far away from Moscow/St.
Petersburg it’s probably like a Wild West (wild east?)
and possibly the culture is influenced less by those far away centers of Russian power.
Maybe a local mafia even.
But also, it’s a city so there would be people more aware of events than rural areas (in general terms).
I’ve seen isolated incidents of people resisting mobilization.
Any chance someone with more experience and knowledge of Russian culture wants to add something?

>Multiple gunshots were heard outside Boyko’s office just before the desk sergeant went in and found his body with five gunshot wounds to the chest.
This man sent a lot of peoples children and husbands to die.
Maybe he had a conscience but also maybe people are starting to kill the faces that lead their family members to slaughter.
