Yes we do, but we're stuck in a cycle where the only way to change the House or any of the system is to overwhelmingly win in the system itself with a huge Dem majority while the GOP has gamed the system via gerrymandering to keep themselves competitive in the House.
So we're basically trapped with it as it is.
"We could be sending people on rockets to other planets, but instead we overwhelmingly choose to send rockets into people on this planet.
".
It's a paradox.
The only time it would be advantageous for our species to have a genetic mutation allowing most of us to think hundreds or thousands of years ahead into the future would be in our current situation of eco-collapse, but we wouldn't be in our current situation if we already had miraculously and against all odds developed that genetic mutation.
I am convinced that change is going to have to happen at a genetic level before people will ever be able to sort themselves out on any sort of large scale.
