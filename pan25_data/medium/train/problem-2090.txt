Yeah … Michaelangelo there with the spray paint can, with the full truck wrap with the Trump-as-Rambo graphics … was probably one of the ones who said that Obama had a “cult of personality” following … and sees absolutely no irony in this photo.
Trump got people like my parents vote because he “Wasn’t a politician” Desantis is just someone they don’t identify with.. 2024 would be just like the midterms last month for the Republicans….
I honestly can’t wait to watch this train wreck.
lolol.

I just went from six to midnight.
