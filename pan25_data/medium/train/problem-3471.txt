What’s even funnier, Biden basically was talking to the people and border control there.
He pretty much said “if I had a wand, what could I do within my ability to help, let me know and we’ll work on getting it done.” Then Gov Abott kinda rushed up to him and shoved a letter to Biden and left.
Abott then immediately went to tv cameras complaining about Biden not listening to him.
