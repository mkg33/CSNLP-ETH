Windows 12, welcoming AI as it is inevitable , and please simma down hunting over 15 different labyrinth mazes of windows and tabs and control panels and gear icons, and sliders , and subsections and scrolling bars ; to still not find features we wish to change without clicking on far away located on the righthandside random sidebar links as to where we wanted to get to all along.
It's become a gong show with your settings that you so called streamlined.
I think it's currently worse than ever.
Yeah fine after a few patches.
On release it was a shit show like other Windows releases.
People getting blue screens because of forced updates, losing data randomly, updates that reduced system performance etc.
Partially, but the demand for remote enabling services are also beginning to decline.
Some companies returning to in office, some business returning to in person.
the blue screens started to creep in lots, at the last couple of recent optional update(s).
sometimes I wonder if MSF and hardware companies grease each other to force upgrades to the masses.
wouldn't surprise me in the least, these are multibillion dollar enterprises at stake.
