How in the fuck is that not political?
An unelected banker decides unilaterally that you should not be paid more, just because there is higher demand for your labor than there used to be.
Why should no one interfere with that?
STOP THAT RIGHT NOW it is not in the country's long term best interest.
A subject we have never cared about one jot before, but today it is critical that you sell your labor for less than what the market will bear.
To save capitalism.
