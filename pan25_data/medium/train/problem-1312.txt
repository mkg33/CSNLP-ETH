How can anyone go on a cruise, I never hear anything good.
They always get diseases, caught in hurricanes or some other crazy shit is always happening to cruises.
There’s no way in hell I’d go on one of those things.
The anti fouling paint on the hulls exterior must have failed.
The fungus would be below the ships waterline and not a threat to the passengers.
The environment the ship gathered the fungus in was probably not compatible with their final destination and this is a precautionary measure to protect the environment.
Viking, like most companies, has great ships and will probably need an extra layer of red paint to keep this from occurring again.
This is common of all types of vessels that operate in different ecosystems!
The rest of your comment sounds reasonable but "Viking, like most companies, has great ships" obviously isn't true if they've cut corners on preventative maintenance so much that they're being denied entry into their ports of call...
They do, but only as a group for things like the massive amount of raw sewage and other pollution they dump into the ocean once they're in international waters along with the notorious amounts of crime that occurs and is rarely punished properly.
