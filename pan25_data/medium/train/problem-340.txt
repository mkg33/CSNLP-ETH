COVID was a major threat to Xi’s aspirations to hold on to power.
COVID related tests, quarantines, and lockdowns were Xi’s strategy for keeping things under control, until his unprecedented 3rd term was solidified.
Xi now has a scapegoat, in the students of White Paper Protest or A4 Revolution, that he can blame for the deaths and chaos in the wake of his policy 180.
The economy will get worse before it gets better; but it will get better simply because of the end of lockdowns.
Come that time, perhaps mid-2023, Xi will re-emerge as the savior.
He will blame the U.S. and the students, as expected, but he will forgive them, if he is smart.
He will try to make deals with and promises to western countries hoping to regain China’s role as the world’s factory.
Whether his plan will success depends on how smart the western leaders are and if they had learned their lessons.

I think it might have been speculative but quite often they have been calling it correctly.
