"Truce?
What do you mean truce?
The guns are already on their way!
Peace talks... Alright forget it, I'll re-route the shipment to the Balkans.
When they say they're gonna have a war, they keep their word.
".
.. we traded the Lord of War for Milli Vanilli .. do we have any spare bioweapons engineers to give Putin next week?
this is the sort of things that get Republicans elected.
If it's anything like DS9, Viktor gets arrested and goes broke after being caught selling weapons of mass destruction.
And we won't see him again until his cousin bails him out in a crazy plot to rescue the cousin's mother.
I'd like to imagine that Viktor has a cousin that owns a bar in some backwater station overlooking a country under recovery from the previous genocidal war.
He has no weapons, even if he did, what use are they to putin?
He made his money getting weapons into conflict zones where they don’t make them.
Russia has factories to produce Kalishnikovs.
Russia doesn’t need some third world supplying arms.
