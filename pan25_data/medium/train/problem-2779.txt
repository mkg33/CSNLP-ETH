Does anyone else sense part of the purpose of these jokes are to help us cope with the real risks of a potential nuclear war?
Assuming say the risk is 5-10% as some reasonable models show, is it responsible to play Russian roulette (no pun intended) with nuclear war?
Should we be pushing harder for a peace deal rn instead of sending $45 billion more continuing the escalation cycle?
Some kind of diplomatic solution needs to be found here.
IMO, we are currently winning the next arms race (AI & towards the path of the theoretical technological singularity) that has a good chance at making nukes obsolete in the next decade or two.
I think we could play more hardball then but for now it seems really risky to play this game.
There won't be nuclear war.
If they were going to use nukes they would have already used them by now, if we're going by their "threats".
They threatened everyone with nukes if weapons were sent to Ukraine, weapons were sent to Ukraine... and nothing happened.
They threatened nukes if Ukraine fired upon "Russian territory", Ukraine sunk their "flagship" of the Black Sea, fired missiles into Crimea, into Belgorod...nothing happened.
They threatened nuclear terrorism with the nuclear power plant if Ukraine made a push for Kherson, Ukraine pushed for Kherson and liberated it...nothing happened.
There were several threats to individual countries for their contributions to Ukraine like the UK, Poland...nothing happened.
Now they're threatening nukes again because of US support for Ukraine and for inviting Zelenskyy to the US.
They're only using these threats because they literally have nothing else.
They won't do anything, they just want to scare off everyone from Ukraine.
Using nukes would have the opposite effect entirely by bringing the full force of NATO to the steps of the Kremlin.
It's not really playing Russian roulette if everyone knows there's no bullet in the chamber.
