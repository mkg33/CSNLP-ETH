Serbia denies that Serbian citizens were involved in preparing military actions aimed at destabilising Moldova up to the overthrow of power, as stated by the President of Moldova based on data transmitted by the Ukrainian special services.
"We demand that the Moldovan side immediately provide all the information available to them because we have not yet received such messages from Moldova," Dačić said.
He added that Serbia cannot but react to this, because the appearance of such information harms the country's reputation, and the participation of Serbian citizens in armed conflicts abroad implies criminal liability.
These types of generalizations are completely unhelpful and only serve to drive Serbs away from the EU and towards Russia.
Obviously the government of Serbia would not be involved in this type of plot, the risks would be far too great even if they felt inclined to do so.
However, it's no secret that a substantial of the Serbian population has a pro-Russian sentiment and thereby serves as a potential recruiment pool for Russia.
That does not mean "Serbia" is helping Russia, it means some Serbs may have been recruited by Russia.
Big difference.
