To the people saying he was an ‘accidental’ death; it doesn’t really make sense.
He was Russian-installed.
He did criticize Shoigu, the Russian Minister of Defence, but he was still a proud Russian propagandist.
It wouldn’t really make sense that Putin would order the FSB to kill him.
In hindsight, I probably should have titled him as ‘Russian-installed’.
This guy was quite an odd character sounds like.
Listen to the podcast Ukrainecast by BBC News (today) to hear some details.
He motorcycle camped across the US, Latin America, with indigenous groups, big fan of Che Guevara, super anti-Ukraine, wanted Russia to conquer Ukraine, France, basically everything.
He was also a member of a really weird cult that blamed everything that’s wrong with the world on (surprise) Jewish people and wanted to unite the countries of Eastern Europe (hey putin).
Besides this, the dude forced his wife to give birth to some (or all) of his 5 kids at home instead of hospital and there’s a TV show where he brags about only eating raw food.
Quite a character.
