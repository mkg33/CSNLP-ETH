Israel's Ambassador to Canada Ronen Hoffman, appointed by former prime minister Yair Lapid, announced on Saturday that he will be resigning from his post this summer because his personal and professional integrity compels him to terminate his position.
Foreign Minister Eli Cohen accepted Hoffman's resignation after sending a written statement saying that in view of the new government's policies, and because it is political appointment, he can no longer continue in his post.
Three weeks ago, Israel's ambassador to France, Yael German, submitted a fiery resignation letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning that the incoming government endangers the character and values of the State of Israel.
German said that Netanyahu's government "includes representatives of parties whose extreme views are expressed in the coalition guidelines, in their policies and in their declarations regarding the passing of legislation that is, in my view, unacceptable.‚Äù.
Netanyahu was so desperate to come back to power he had to take in ultra-rightist and fringe religious group.
This is the right thing to do.
If an ambassador does not agree with their countries policies, to the extent that the ambassador cannot present them to the host country in the best light, and defend them, then resignation is the correct step to take.
The Ambassador's resignation sounds totally normal and respectable to me.
(I am NOT making any comment or statement about Bibi's policies, or his (un)fitness to be prime minister).
How he can navigate governing with this dead weight will be interesting as already several ambassadors have had enough and submitted to resign their post.
