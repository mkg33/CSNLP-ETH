Lol what?
There’s only been two recorded Earthquakes in California history over a 7.5 magnitude and they both completely wrecked shit.
California has a lot of small tremors, but for Earthquakes over 6.5 magnitude, which California has only had 16 of, they completely wreck the area.
You would just never know when thing would just scatter the most after all, destruction is what it all causes.
When buildings get destroyed due to earthquake and people lose their lives that stuff is indeed difficult enough to watch over!
Feeling a weird pulse go through the ground underneath you once in a while took some getting used to, but it also wasn't super common.
A few times a year you'd feel a sort of pulse pass under and through you, and if you had a glass of water in front of you you'd see it sway a tiny a bit.
It was practically instantaneous.
People comment on it like it's weather.
If it’s anything like Vancouver island (we are very close) you are half correct.
We are constantly having earthquakes and if you look up how many we’ve had in the past year it’s probably in the hundreds but we feel absolutely nothing.
Maybe one but they never do damage.
