So liberal rules that are being debated like the student loan relief are paused, while shit like this is left in place.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
I get the point but student loan relief can't be undone once it's implemented, so the legal issues have to be dealt with first.
In this case, the impending wave of migrants at the border forced a decision to come now.
The student debt question isn't as time sensitive as this.
There has been an impending wave of migrants since the dawn of Fox news.
The question here isn't if title 42 is a good policy or not, that isn't the court's place to decide.
The legal question is can a president undo an executive order of a previous president.
The court ruling today says "oh jeez we aren't sure...." Which is stupid and flies in the face of centuries of precedent and the design of our government.
Yes the court ruled that Trump could have undone DACA but he didn't follow the proper procedure to do so under the APA and that his decision to do so was "done in an arbitrary and capricious manner".
If he wanted to he could have tried again following the proper procedure and it would have succeeded but he is an incompetent buffoon and just gave up.
