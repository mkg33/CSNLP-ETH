The FBI is doing this so they can show that nobody else has boxes of thousands of documents laying around with classified material.
It's all part of building the case against Trump.
They don't actually suspect Biden or Pence to be doing anything illicit.
It's crazy that both Pence and Biden have had or are having their properties searched so quickly by the FBI while cooperating.
Meanwhile Drumpf's properties (aside from mar-a-lago) aren't getting searched despite him lying about having those documents and then allegedly moving them around to hide them.
Once they find stuff they know was last left with Trump that some off the classified material was moved to Pence.
Hence Trump not saying anything bad about him, lately.
Pence is back in the Trump train and his ticket was helping hide government secrets.
