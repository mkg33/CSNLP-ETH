Ehh I'm not sure if he's faking being crazy to make countries worried he might follow up on threats like nuclear weapons, I mean if he was a crazy as all that I'd expect more than the hitherto empty threats.
The scale is staggering for regular people like me when you look at how much the US has given but realize how it's hardly more than a rounding error for their whole military budget... and then you realize that they're pretty much only giving them old stuff that they don't really need anymore...
Personally I find it very frustrating, Russia is the number one threat for the US army.
The other probable foes Iran North Korea and China arent going to result in the kind of massive mechanized combat that requires the full strenh of the US army.
(The Navy, Marines and Air Force are another story).
We should be giving them everything that's not currently tied down and if that's not enough we should start taking systems from our troops and giving them to Ukraine.. they're the ones fighting our enemy for us.
We don't need to hang on to many thousands of tow missiles that we have to kill Russian tanks if we send them to go kill Russian tanks.
It seems like on some level decisions are being made as if there's still some other Russia untouched by this conflict ready to invade the Baltics at a moment's notice.
There's no national security concern if some portion of the US army is short a bit of equipment for a while while we're readying replacement stuff.
An attack on a NATO member is to be treated as an attack on each and every member.
And I imagine that if you look at each member’s laws and shit, you’ll probably find that an invasion is pretty much treated as a declaration of war.
You’re acting like an idiot.
An invasion of a NATO member is the start of WW3.
Or at least the start of a war between Russia and NATO.
Ukraine is not a member of NATO.
There is no obligation for NATO to defend Ukraine.
There is, however, an obligation to defend the rest of the NATO members.
