>"People write about 2013 and 14 as if I had had nothing else to concern myself with than the Minsk agreement, and ask: ‘How could you have taken your eye off Ukraine?’ But this is too simple.
We had elections [in Germany], there was always something going on with Greece at the time, and I broke my pelvic bone," she said, referring to an injury incurred while on a cross-country skiing holiday in 2014.
While it sounds ridiculoua, it is still true that personal injuries takes something away of the capacity to deal with other issues.
This is also true for top politicans.
The problem of Merkel was that she shied away from any policies that were controversial.
In that regard, the ministers most likely followed the same idea of not engaging in problems but try to sit it out.
For example it is widely known that Merkel didn't close the borders during the refugee crisis and many blame here for "inviting welfare migrants".
When the harder truth is, Merkel wanted to close the borders.
But because she knew that then the police would have to use for force to keep asylum seekers out of Germany, and news would show the police use force, that it would be very controversial with the German population.
And to the part that is relevant to my argument: She asked her ministers if anybody would guarantee that police using force won't happen (and become the scapegoat when videos would inevitably surface), but none of them stepped up to take the lead.
So under Merkel, i don't think there were government ministers that actually would have had the balls to make controversial decisions.
And the more time passes, the more it becomes clear that sitting out problems until they vanish works great in the short term.
But long term the debt of unsolved problems comes back, and with interest.
