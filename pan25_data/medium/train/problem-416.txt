I do in-home estimates for my dealership.
The corporate sales trainer was here running estimates with me.
He had a rental car with CA plates.
He met me at this customer's house because it was easier than meeting at the office, so he had his rental car.
She sees his CA plate and says she doesn't do business with liberals from CA.
She is a moron, just one of the stupidest human beings I have ever met.
I didn't sell her anything, she was too cheap to buy the good stuff.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
