I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone talk about “non-mainstream media”.
No one will think you’re talking about some fringe YouTube channel with 12 subs if you just say “media”.
Sorry for the rant I just really dislike that phrase.
And the media.
The "mainstream" media bends over backwards to kowtow to Republicans so they are not perceived as "liberal".
So when Republicans screamed about "liberal clerks" who leaked - and because they were the loudest promoting this guess - the media jumped all over it.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
I actually agree with you.
I put it into " " for that reason.
But ... it is CBS, NBC, ABC, CNN etc.
that bend over backwards and actually end up promoting Republican demagogues, bullies, liars, publicity seekers, and loudmouths.
