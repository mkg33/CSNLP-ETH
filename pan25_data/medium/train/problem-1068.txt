Either way, 2C is really fucking bad.
Climate change disasters has been happening for at least a decade at this point.
The drought preceding (and causing) the Syrian civil war was climate related, for example.
The unusually large/many hurricanes in the US is also related to climate change, as another example.
The droughts and heatwaves in Europe, which I think is what Macron was talking about, is another, and has been happening for years now.
Like this was not the first one, it was just the worst so far(I think?).
Truly idiotic statement.
There's an important lesson about the difference between unanticipated consequences, and unintended consequences.
It's true that he had absolutely no way to know that CFCs would be a global-level threat to life: that's an unanticipated consequence.
But he definitely knew that lead was a poison, and while I doubt he intended to poison multiple generations of children, lowering their IQ and making them more prone to violence, he knew it could be an issue.
But he did it anyway, all for the sake profit: "Unintended consequences be damned", he likely thought.
