Other players will get called up and the world cup is the biggest stage to present yourself.
Players get huge contracts after world cups because they played well.
It simply won't happen.
Major FAs like Brazil, Germany, France, England and so on could have joined forces and declined to play, that would have been an option.
But those are most of the time on the same level of corruption.
I don't blame the players, it would have been a Kaepernick situation just in a different sport.
Their name would have been dragged through the mud and FIFA would have done anything in their power to discredit them.
Football is dirty behind the scenes and I don't think it's as easy to drop out of the worldcup as a player as you think without facing major repercussions.
And by "terrible situation", he specifically means 6,500 deaths so far and counting.
For a fucking soccer match.
FIFA has blood on its hands.
All those workers were real people with real lives and families.
They were poor and brown, but they were regular ass human beings at the end of the day.
How the fuck could they let this happen?
Would they have ignored even 2 or 3 deaths in America or Canada?
Forget 6,500.
