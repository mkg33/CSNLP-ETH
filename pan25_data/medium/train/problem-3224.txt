The total lack of compassion from the Turkish government toward their own citizens during this tragedy has been disgusting.
Erdogan and his government has refused to use the military for the relief efforts, has refused to work with local leaders due to partisan differences, and has now taken action to block a critical means of communication in the effort to save lives.
Don’t worry though, he’ll keep the streets safe!
The military might not be there to help save people, but a force of nearly 20,000 has been deployed to combat “looting” in a law enforcement effort.
This is significant because people have been trying to coordinate rescue and aid needs and resources over social media.
It's possible to access Twitter over VPN, but many are concerned about the increased battery consumption, since it's not easy to charge devices right now.
People had been organizing aid and rescue efforts over social media, and there were also wide criticism of places where government actions were ineffectual or outright nonexistent.
Amateur footage had started to emerge on social media where people had been criticising.
Finally, a video that shows people booing and kicking the car of a minister fleeing from them.
This is the worst thing that could've happened about the rescue efforts.
Tons of people organized and coordinate on social media, mostly on Twitter and they've done much more to help those people than goverment did.
It seems like goverment is not even trying to help, and now they are blocking communication for those who is.
I dont know is it possible the handle the situation worst.
Today, Erdogan and his entourage visited the quake sites, in the third day.
Media was banned from broadcasting his interactions with citizens.
