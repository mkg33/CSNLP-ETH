I don't think it's right to say the government collapsed.
There wasn't a vote of no confidence or anything like that.
The PM resigned and the parliament appointed a new one.
That's a relatively normal part of parliamentary democracies.
Also, in a TV presentation that Lukashenko of Belarus did, he stupidly accidentally (or cunningly - "accidentally?"
- it remains to be seen...) revealed that the plan was to annex Moldova in its entirety after seizing all of Ukraine, so as to expand the borders of Russia right up to Romania and Poland.
When the Soviet Union broke up there was this massive power grab across the former empire.
In Moldova it got incredibly bloody between the Transnistrians who wanted to join Ukraine to side with Russia and the Moldovans who wanted to join Romania.
The region was created as a middle ground to allow them to join the Ukrainians (probably now Russians) if Romania and Moldova sought reunification.
The Russian troops are there as part of the settlement.
Hypothetically the Moldovans wouldn't persecute the Transnistrians if "peaceepers" were there.
There's a similar situation in Kosovo (officially a province of Serbia) as an autonomous region with NATO peacekeepers.
Sounds nice in theory, but the presence of the huge ammunition depot there rather diminishes non-military aims for the region.
Now witness the power of this fully armoured divis.

How old is that ammo?

What do you mean there are no spares?
Well yes, but no.
It's been autonomous since 1924 within whatever country it was a part of.
It was originally part of the Ukrainian SSR, then the Moldovan SSR, then the Nazi Romanians took it, and then it went back to Moldova.
But they always had some form of autonomous government.
In the early stages of the Ukraine invasion of 2022 (e.g.
not 2014) there was a very clear attempt for the South military force group to link up with Transnistria, to supply their forces with ammunition and totally isolate Odesa.
The Ukrainians were putting up more of a fight than they had anticipated, clearly (a bit of a theme by that point…), and had held them up at Mykolaiv - so they tried to bypass it to gain access to a route to take them into Moldova and Transnistria.
Fortunately, they were repelled before they got there, primarily I think by destruction of their logistics so the armour couldn’t proceed.
This quite likely saved Odesa.
