And you appear to be attributing Heller to the "kangaroo court made up of Republican idealogues forced on the court with zero Democratic support," but that's just incorrect.
Heller happened in 2008.
The filibuster for judicial nominations wasn't abolished until 2013.
Every single justice sitting in 2008 was confirmed with both Democrat and Republican support.
Most of the justices involved in that decision were confirmed with over 90 "yes" votes in the Senate.
Two were confirmed with fewer than 60.
Not exactly the ultra-partisan kangaroo court you were describing.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
