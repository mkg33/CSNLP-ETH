I'll never understand TikTok.
I couldn't even get into Snapchat or Instagram Stories or other stuff like that.
I only have something worth sharing and ready to share once in a while, and I'll type it out or show a picture of whatever it is.
The idea of every day filming myself multiple times for content....I can't even imagine what I'd do to meet those requirements.
I teach in a midwestern US school district that implemented a similar policy this year.
One reason for it is that students were recording EVERYTHING and putting it in social media.
Closeup videos of teachers’ butts, fights, students having emotional breakdowns in the bathroom, a student who had a seizure, a teacher with MS who fell in the hallway and couldn’t get back up.
The first instinct is no longer to ignore something or even to help, it is to film it and post it in social media for clout.
Once something has been passed along to the entire student body and beyond, it is impossible to track down where it came from (and sometimes there are multiple versions from different angles).
