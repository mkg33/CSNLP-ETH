You think DeSantis is a non-starter for voters?
Trump is for sure, and the primaries will be a bruising affair for any other GOP Presidential hopefuls, but I wouldn't count out suburban white women swinging a vote for DeSantis.
I think GOP leadership is trying to thread the needle between keeping the crazy fringe on board, while trying to reclaim the "kitchen table" crime, economy, family knows best contingency of suburban voters... and all it takes is low Dem turnout to have them go from the cliffs edge to the seat of power.
Makes me nervous, but maybe I'm being pessimistic.
