Even within the mainland the previous insistence from government health ministry on only having 5k deaths since 2020 was seen as very much unlikely.
Depressing to see that the current estimates provided shows even a modest estimate to be around 60k deaths just in the month of December to January aloneâ€¦.
Their vaccine is not properly effective, and the only way to keep numbers down is by basically locking in everyone that is living/working in a 1000m radius of a confirmed case.
Since this is death count reported from hospitals, it doesn't account for deaths outside hospitals.
It doesn't account for smaller hospitals who probably don't record stuff so accurately... if at all.
It doesn't account for the fact that hospitals are asked by the government to limit what's considered "death by covid or death contributed by covid" in the most strictest sense.
It doesn't account for people who didn't get proper care because Chinese hospitals are currently incredibly understaffed and overpopulated with patients.
