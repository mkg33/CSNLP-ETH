You wouldn't survive a week without Chinese products.
Reddit makes me realise there is a much worse choice than our out of touch politicians.
What a great solution.
They’re a source for cheap decent quality products.
I always choose USA made if I can, but the point is most companies cannot afford to manufacture products in other countries.
The economic consequences of ceasing trade with China will be unlike anything we’ve seen before.
That’s how it’s going to be lmao you really think the US is going to put an embargo on China over them sending ammunitions to Russia.
Boycott all you want but the US will not ban trade with China.
Thats BS.
Companies manufacturing in the USA cannot compete with companies doing it abroad.
Stop important cheap labor altogether and in the mid term, CEOs and stakeholders will stop making so much money but the price of products will necessarily remain within reasonable ranges, because that’s what people are willing to pay.
But sadly we are trained to defend the interests of the rich at our own expense.
Of course it does stop being obtuse.
Of course if it’s broken throw it away.
You said get rid of your cell phone etc….
You did not specify “when it breaks” so one can only assume you meant right now.
