As long as they're not pretty much instantly punished for wrongdoing, in their minds they win.
They get all the benefits of their lies, they get the drama and attention of you calling them out on things, and it's not like the people that caught them can follow them around the rest of their lives warning everyone they interact with of the type of person they are, so the moment the victims/accusers return to their lives the liar just goes back to the lie and it's business as usual.
Eventually they'll even begin to play the victim for having been caught, accusing the people who did their homework of "stalking" and "being obsessed," because they only want you to pay attention to the things they want you to see.
If people begin to treat them or think of them as the person they've revealed themselves to be they'll just consider those people dead to them and find new targets that still fall for their tricks.
Lather, rinse, repeat.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
