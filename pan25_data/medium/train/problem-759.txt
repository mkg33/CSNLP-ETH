I think the reason people get so riled up is because the country has such an incredible amount of potential but it gets completely shat on by the leadership of the country, time and time again.
The private sectors in the country are great but government constantly finds a way to mess with anything they can lay their hands on.
I'm just sharing this because every single day our electricity is turned off for about 7.5 hours, sometimes less and sometimes significantly more, but this has been going on for years.
Meanwhile, whilst struggling to keep up with the maintenance of the energy grid, and while producing less energy now than in 2008 after spending over $40 bn on the grid (yes they spent $40 bn and somehow now produce even less energy), they now want to fire maintenance staff because of the colour of their skin.
I remember talking to some in South Africa's telephone company, a group of maintenance staff were sent to Zimbabwe to fix there telephone exchanges.
They were paid a lot and worked in multiple exchanges and managed to get the phone system working again.
