I mean cool, but clearly with what you quoted here, this is temporary due to increased rains.
We need a more sustainable source.
Having more wind or solar farms are necessary to make meaningful gains against non renewables.
Hopefully, there will be some large investments in those as well as nuclear energy to remove Russia and oil from their positions of power.
I saw something the other day that it is now cheaper in the US to build new wind and solar (with the gridscale batteries needed to grid balance) than it is to keep operating existing coal plants.
building coal (or gas) power plants takes even longer.
though the thing that takes longest is nuclear (and is hardest to get companies to build because it takes decades for them to pay themselves back).
That is true, but that doesnâ€™t take into account the amount of time it would take to transition.
Building wind and solar takes a lot of time.
Hopefully we see a transition in investments, but I am doubtful with how much of a hold oil/gas companies have on so many people.
wind and solar installations also create a larger number of long lasting decent paying jobs over a larger geographically distributed area.
True, but the statement before is that operating the existing plants costs more than solar and wind investment.
Also US just approved plans for small modular nuclear plants that may take less investment and time.
Looking forward to the developments forthcoming in the nuclear field.
