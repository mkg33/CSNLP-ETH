One year in and instead of a unified population Putin is dealing with his command structure falling into infighting over ammunition.
The Wagner guy seems to have used troll farms to make the Russian military look bad in an attempt to get more supplies.
However, he was just told that everyone is ammo starved in the Russian military and Wagner is getting the same unusable ammunition for their rifles and artillery.
It turns out using poorly maintained stockpiles from 50yrs ago is a bad idea.
Who could have guessed the Russian war machine was actually built like an old Lada.
Do not under estimate a lada!
I crossed all Ukraine from east to west, from Zaporozhye to Romania border in a 1974 old lada and didn't have any problem, i would even like to keep it but because of the situation i had to just leave it abandoned in the border...
The maintenance is necessary, that's the problem whit ruzzian, they stole all the money for that and proceed to say " yes supreme leader, is all done" cleptocracy...
