>In the lack of an official position of power in Russia, Rogozin declared himself the head of the "Tsar's Wolves" inspection group of volunteers, with the stated aim of testing and supplying weapons for Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Rogozin has been posting images of himself dressed up as a soldier in expensive military gear on Telegram.
And his point was that Russians are hurting too.
And he got this while being on occupied Ukraine land.
So to me, what he really said was - "Russia's in the wrong place, the wrong time, doing the wrong things- here's some evidence.
".
You lost two friends?
How many people have you helped rob of friends and loved ones?
What a fucking piece of shit monster.
We need to try again and succeed.
And?
You started it, you have foreign allies that are helping to murder innocents.
Why should anyone care you got hurt by a weapon from one of your victims allies?
I would answer in the lines of “I am sorry, please report to the Elysèe so that I can repeatedly reinstall the piece of shrapnel in question on your body until you meet a satisfactory death.
Warmest regards, Emmanuel”.
