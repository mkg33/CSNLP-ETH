Quit picking on George - he’s the perfect Republican representative and that’s what America’s about: representation!
Now if Santos were politically powerful, that's a different story.
Then they'd shovel his shit for years.
They figure more and more shit is going to come out about this guy and no one wants to have to defend him.
If they were serious they'd be calling for an expulsion vote.
Nobody imagines Santos is going to resign, and calling for him to resign is just empty posturing.
