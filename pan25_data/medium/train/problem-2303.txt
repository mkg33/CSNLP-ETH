I feel like everything these days is an investigation and the investigation ends with “oh yeah they doin the thing thats bad” and we all go “see its official!
They’re doing the thing we all already had enough evidence of to know long before the investigation” and then next to nothing happens about it.
That's not wrong but the investigation are important.
Neutral investigation by trusted bodies undermine propaganda and document the events for history.
Will it solve the problem?
No, but don't throw out the good in search of the perfect.
Agreed, the best we can do is show the countries ran by dictators how much better it is to have freedoms and hope they make the right choices.
There is incredibly strong propaganda though, every second post (if not more) seem to have a “what about the west…” comments that do nothing to add anything of substance.
>Tehran's representative at the Geneva meeting Khadijeh Karimi earlier accused Western states of using the rights council to target Iran, a move she called "appalling and disgraceful".
