Congressional subpoenas are a joke and I doubt he will ever be forced to comply with those, but he has actually been forced to comply with the NY civil suit and testified.
He pleaded the 5th hundreds of times, but that isn't exactly a great idea in a civil suit, since guilt can be inferred.
In the DOJ and Fulton DA investigations, he hasn't testified or been issued a subpoena because he's the top criminal target and not a witness.
Hopefully the only circumstances we see him testifying is after an indictment during a trial.
