Such a ridiculous thing, because they were attempting to make a statement about how they're always "persecuted" by the left....so now they're going to "own it" or some shit, completely ignoring that there's every reason under the sun to legitimately ridicule them and point out their extremism.
It just falls so flat, and is the typical victim complex that comes with the right, especially the evangelicals, who have essentially claimed the Republican party (though it's not as if the right wasn't like this before).
They fail so hard at being clever, because they're simply not, at all.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
