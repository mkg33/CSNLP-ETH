It has been done before, people need to realize that every time businesses have stopped doing really stupid/greedy things is because the Government stepped in.
I'm old enough to remember credit cards just going insane with fees and having minimum payments not even cover the basic interest fees (creating a never-ending cycle) and the only reason it got better is due to the CARD act in 2009.
Companies will never do the right thing on their own or for the "free market", Consumer protections from the government are the only way to stop the cycle.
Credit processors and companies are working on ways to pass credit card fees on to the customer even more.
My job is rolling this out and I hate it.

That's not what "tax deductible" means.
Processing fees are just deducted from revenue when determining the company's tax burden.
Say a particular gas station had $10 million in revenue, but paid $50k in processing fees for the year.
They would be taxed as if their revenue was $9.95 million.
