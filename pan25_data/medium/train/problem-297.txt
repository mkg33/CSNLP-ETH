BJP is going to win for a few more decades in UP and Gujarat now, they transformed Gujarat from open lawlessness to an orderly business savy system.
Doing the same in UP, first year in power 2017 saw the UP Police kill over a thousand goons in encounters, may sound extreme but the level of support politically connected gangsters got under SP was criminal.
Under BJP criminals surrendered begging to not be killed.
Such an improvement in the lives of people does not go unrewarded.
Exploiting people through low paying jobs and high expenses is way more profitable.
BJP in UP is a blessing but overall monopoly of a single party is not healthy for us..
I hope Congress wins few more states to give a healthy competition to BJP but not in UP, let BJP stay in UP.
I agree with this, BJP is getting loose because there's no actual chance of them losing the center.
A competent opposition should tighten them up but Congress can't do that with the Clown Prince .
This is about as surprising as Dems winning California.
Like they did look vulnerable last election due to an agitation and lost many seats in their bastion.
BUT this time main opposition party(congress) basically ignored the state and got their votes split by the new party AAP.
Congress biggest face who is on an idiotic march across India basically took 2 rallies in the state and it showed as if they didn't care.
Now they also lost a lot of candidates to the other parties but it's not like keeping those would've won the state anyway.
