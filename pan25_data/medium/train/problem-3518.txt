Seems what they're doing isn't even close to what Japan's doing to try to combat the situation.
And what I find funny is unlike China, Japan has decent immigration demand but the government, even in the face of being, in their own words: at "the brink of not being able to maintain a functioning society,‚Äù Japan is still bending over backwards to do anything other than encourage immigration.
The fact that it's standard issue to sell clean dress shirts in all major convenience stores (so you can go buy a fresh shirt because you didn't have time to go home and get a clean one), is quite telling.
The issue is I don't know if any government has successfully encouraged their own population to have more babies.
The mass decision not to have more kids is a highly complex social phenomenon with tons of factors feeding into it, many of which are hard to change within even a generation or so.
That's why most developed countries tend to rely on immigration to make up for their lower birthrates.
If Japan can succeed at it then good for them I guess, but the issue is they have been trying this exact thing for years now, probably over a decade at this point, and it hasn't worked at all.
If their government took steps to alleviate either of these issues I'm sure they would see some improvement.
They don't have to encourage immigration.
They have to encourage their own citizens to live.
I know exactly one country where it's notmal to see sleeping business men on the streets.
