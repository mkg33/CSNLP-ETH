my elderly neighbors can watch a silly news story about a local parking lot painting their lines to close together on the YouTube of our cbs affiliate.
They see thousands of comments- literally just a slithering cesspool- from (obviously foreign) bots saying how America is hopeless because of woke atheist witches or whatever… and then the elderly neighbor, whose always been a kind, gentle person, begins talking about how they heard about how the atheist witches are woke and ruining our lives… the whole thing is targeted at vulnerable groups and the resulting aftermath isn’t just sad, it’s dangerous.
If you've ever lived somewhere that's in the spotlight of a controversial take with first hand experience you get to see exactly how much misinformation is intentionally spread and its scary.
And when you look into the accounts further it's usually mass Russian or Chinese "bots" (likely just paid social media spammers) and actual people buy into it as if it were from their God himself.
They'll literally argue from their shitter in Texas about how the events outside of your front door aren't actually how you say they are and that he knows better.
Shits crazy.
