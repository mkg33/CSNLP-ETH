Over the last 5 years, I’ve lost my younger twin brothers and an older sister to overdoses that all began with legit prescriptions for oxy.
My mom was the first to discover their bodies.
I wish some of that money would go towards counseling for her, and to help our family with the burial costs.
She’s also always wanted to visit Paris, wish some of that settlement would go towards some self-care things like that.
Red States want to give the money back to Perdue and let it trickle down to the communities.
Blue States want to fund drug rehabilitation and harm reduction treatment during the process.
IE: BLUE STATES WANT TO GIVE THE DRUGGIES MONIES Lets meet in the middle.
And give Perdue its money back, and people can buy their drugs.
Win Win.
