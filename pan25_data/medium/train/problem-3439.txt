Banks don’t get to absorb into their own ledgers the funds of accounts that have problems… That’s now how this works.
The funds will sit frozen and either later be unfrozen (so the owners can go back to using them as desired) or will be transferred to some other recipients yet to be determined.
That determination process is a legal one, mired in various contracts and Swiss banking law.
Edit: note that this is “assets.” I’d guess only a small chunk of it is cash.
Shares are likely a mix of publicly traded and closely held.
Probably a good amount of precious metals mixed in, possibly other tangible assets not easily leveraged by CS.
This is all speculation, of course, but would follow from typical portfolios of other large clients of other Swiss banks.
I would assume that Credit Suisse is expected to continue to use the money as part of their pool of capital, and to pay interest on it.
Can someone knowledgeable about banking law confirm this?
If so, it is a great thing for the bank to have a pisspot of money on their balance sheet, and to know it is locked in place until there is a significant alteration in the geopolitical balance of power.
From experience in working at an international bank, they can't touch the funds unless the government orders them to.
(since this is being blocked by sanctions) So if there is a bank run, they won't be able to touch those funds.
It stays there until further notice.
Ps; in usa and Canada (& other countries too) government protects you (the citizens) from bank runs anyway.
All the bank does is get bought up and switches top brass.
So bank runs rarely happen.
