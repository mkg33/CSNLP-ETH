Incredible how inept the Russians are.
Im convinced you could probably fly a full squadron of f35's at max altitude and go undetected.
The latest stealth technology has to be effective against Russian AA systems if they cant even detect a goddamn 1970's Soviet-era Drone, modified or not.
Not even remotely advanced and hardly any stealth tech in the damn thing probably.
Honestly its incredible they pulled this off twice, much less even once.
Flying 400 miles through Russian territory and not a single detection, notice or counter towards it.
Just insane to think this is suppost to be a "world superpower" and they cant even secure their OWN BORDERS!
Russia is big but come on now... A foreign enemy object would never make it inside US airspace, much less 400 frickin miles inland.
If you have an issue with Reuters and how they handle reporting then that’s a “you” problem.
As far as I know Reuters is not a Russian biased news source.
I can’t seem to access the original article in this reddit post since it was updated, Reuters must be fairly confident to have updated their original article.
Your misrepresentation of Reuters only relaying what Russian agencies reported citing the country's defence ministry to pretend that what Russia says has any more credibility is telling.
