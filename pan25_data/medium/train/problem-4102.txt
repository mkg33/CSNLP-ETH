But actually, he thought as he re-adjusted the Ministry of Plenty's figures, it was not even forgery.
It was merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense for another.
Most of the material that you were dealing with had no connexion with anything in the real world, not even the kind of connexion that is contained in a direct lie.
Statistics were just as much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version.
A great deal of the time you were expected to make them up out of your head.
For example, the Ministry of Plenty's forecast had estimated the output of boots for the quarter at one-hundred-and-forty-five million pairs.
The actual output was given as sixty-two millions.
Winston, however, in rewriting the forecast, marked the figure down to fifty-seven millions, so as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had been overfulfilled.
In any case, sixty-two millions was no nearer the truth than fifty-seven millions, or than one-hundred-and-forty-five millions.
Very likely no boots had been produced at all.
Likelier still, nobody knew how many had been produced, much less cared.
All one knew was that every quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper, while perhaps half the population of Oceania went barefoot.
I can feel your sarcasm, so I'm going to tell you asking someone on the internet for a source while your on the internet, and then complaining when your actually given the most baseline of information available, which is actually a decent place to start to check for accuracy, makes it feel like you actually didn't want to find out.
