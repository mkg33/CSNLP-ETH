What if President Biden had appointed Hunter Biden as his Senior White House Advisor and his job was to broker peace in the Middle East and pursue diplomacy with China?
What if because of Hunter's financial dealings with foreign governments that he couldn't get the top secret security clearance?
What if Hunter failed to disclose during his security clearance process that he was 1 billion dollars in debt?
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
There are so many more what ifs too numerous to post.
What if Hunter went on diplomacy trips to China and Saudi Arabia and never gave reports of what was discussed?
What if President Biden overruled counterintelligence officials and just gave Hunter the top security clearance via fiat?
What if once on the job Hunter brokered the deal for the US to sell Saudi Arabia 100 billion dollars worth of weapons and during this process Hunter went to our weapons manufacturers and asked them to give Saudi Arabia a discount price?
What if after 2 years on the job Hunter resigns and starts up an investment firm and Prince Bone Saw, over the objections of his financial advisors, gives Hunter Biden 2 billion dollars?
Now imagine if after all that Democrats still had Joe Biden among their front-runners.
Nope, I can't even imagine that but I have to accept the other stuff is all real - just replace the Bidens with Trump and Kushner.
