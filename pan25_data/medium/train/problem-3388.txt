it's weird but when I imagine Russias full nuclear purge, I smile.
Imagine ending three century of darkness, incarceration, communism induced mass poverty and slavery, spreading their political cancer to create more poverty from the America's to Africa, and all the "moden Russia postcommunist aftermath" mind degeneration... One Gagarin but a hundred million of poor slaves and exported genocides...
They even created the Israel Palestine conflict by hiding Arafats (arab Girkin) real birth certificate (born in Egypt cuz there never was a Palestine state - it's just one of the sowjet, made up "vietcong-donezk-peoples-republics movements" exports, a terrorist state).
I tried explaining the logistics (not to mention the cost) of sending a first rate Main Battle Tank halfway across the world to people who have no experience with one and what that kind of timeline looks like.
They don't want to hear it.
If their head lines aren't filled with 'X sends Y amount of Z' to Ukraine, they think the west is just sitting on their hands.
