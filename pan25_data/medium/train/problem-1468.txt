Um… There’s a vast rift between Katie Porter and Hakeem Jeffries and, if you’re a fan of Porter, I’d highly recommend you delve into Jeffries’ track record and where he throws his support — especially in intra-party matters.
Jefferies is currently having state Reps primaried to prevent people like Jabari Brisport from coming for his seat.
I hope Brisport does.
He's my State Rep and I think he's great.
Good person too.
Met him a few times.
