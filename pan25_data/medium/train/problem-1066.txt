Interesting to read the comments in that article.
To see Republicans saying it's time for Trump to go because he's too devisive.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Trump literally said "If you win all the credit goes for me.
If you lose you should get all the blame."
Or something along those lines.
I mean.
For once Trump was honest.
Join r/ParlerTrick, make lots of fake MAGA accounts, and spend the next two years blaming the loss on the GOP on right wing social media.
Encourage MAGA holdouts to never donate to the GOP again, only Trump and his super pacs.
It's pretty much guaranteed Trump backed candidates crash and burn and that he won't ever spend a dime on actual elections.
Sow division in the GOP on MAGA/DeSantis/GOP lines while pretending to be a Conservative all over social media.
Divide, divide, divide.
