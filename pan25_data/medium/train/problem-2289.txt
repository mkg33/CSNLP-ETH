Problem is all the top dogs are ruthless wolves.
Russia is like Nazi Germany.
The Brits had several chances to knock off Hitler, but all things considered, they didn't pull the trigger.
They figured he was doing more harm than good to the German war effort, and that would not be true of his replacement.
The thing to look at is the personality.
These wolves have no disposition to play nice.
When they get control of a country and its military, it gets turned into a machine to eat other countries.
One after another.
People have this weird idea that a wolf can be negotiated with.
Just give them half of Ukraine and they will be satisfied!
It's like a spoiled rich kid, you don't cure them by giving them a bunch of money.
What do you mean?
I'm sure he'd love to have a conversation with them, at the long end of a 14ft table, with armed guards at every enterance point, 30ft from anyone else, under extreme surveillance, with everyone in the room thouroughly background checked and their private communications intercepted.
