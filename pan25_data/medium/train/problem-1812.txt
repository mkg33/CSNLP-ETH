Republic of Abkhazia, is a partially recognised state in the South Caucasus, recognised by most countries as part of Georgia, which views the region as an autonomous republic.
[10][11][12][13] It lies on the eastern coast of the Black Sea, south of the Greater Caucasus mountains in northwestern Georgia.
It covers 8,665 square kilometres (3,346 sq mi) and has a population of around 245,000.
Its capital and largest city is Sukhumi.
It is a Russian client state located just south of Sochi.
Russia is using a small indigenous minority of northern Georgia to prevent Georgia from joining NATO, and they do not need to treat its "parliamentary delegation" with respect, as that small minority has no other recourse to maintain their statelet but with Russian troops in Georgia.
Russia is doing the same thing further east in Georgia in South Ossetia.
Of course, when movements of indigenous minorities of Southern Russia occur...Russia flattens Grozny and rapes and murders entire villages.
They have a very warped view of "self-determination" that involves pushing Russian troops as far west as possible (Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia).
They were doing this pretty much out of the gate from the early 1990s, actually even shortly before the fall of the Soviet Union in Moldova.
