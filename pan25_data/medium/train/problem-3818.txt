My friend works in liquor PR in New York, and lots of liquor companies hold branded parties to get their names out there.
In February of 2020 I was my friend's +1 to a party being thrown by some Italian liqueur brand, only to show up and be told that the Italian staff weren't being allowed out of Italy due to COVID ripping through that country.
I thought nothing of it, but like a week later it hit NY and I'm pretty sure I started locking down then.
It was close to Milan but in another province of the same regione.
But Italy was only the first one to become aware of it.
Covid popped up everywhere after the very first test on non-Chinese people in Italy.
EDIT: sorry for “regione”, I meant region.
It’s the iPhone autocorrect (Italian keyboard).
Love you all who corrected me.
Eat more pasta and spaghetti and everything with a vocal at the end, please ❤️.
Pro tip, the “i” is silent when it comes after g (or c).
Re-jon-neh would be the Italian pronunciation.
I understand that certain southern dialects might introduce a bit of an “i” sound which might be why Italian Americans (at least as portrayed on TV…) pronounce the otherwise silent vowel.
