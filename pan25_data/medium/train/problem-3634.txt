Quote from the guy who was nearly killed by the leadership of the Republican party in a failed coup against our democracy, but refuses to take any action to hold anyone in his party accountable.
Either he has a backbone and fears for his safety making an actual stand.Or he doesn't have a backbone and cannot dig the country out of this mess.
In either case I see zero reason to consider him as a candidate.
Either, the system he is a part of is so broken it must be usurped by something oppositional(say a democratic party), or he cannot do what must be done to keep us safe.
They started hating him again after his "betrayal" of Trump, and his career here is totally dead again.
He's not going to have another opportunity to fix his image.
And I don't think he's aware of that and just using this as a grift, I think he's actually enough of a delusional/religious weirdo to genuinely believe that God will step in and help him out again.
