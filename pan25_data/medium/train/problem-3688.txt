W/O sarcasm, these sponsors accept that DeSantis needs to say what he needs to say, but as long as he does what these sponsors ask him to do, NBD for them.
DeSantis was able to get rid of Disney’s self governing status which I think hurts Disney a lot.
I don’t think Disney wants to cause any more damage to themselves right now.
I don’t disagree.
But I’ve read reports that DeSantis is finding a way so Florida will not absorb the debt.
Whether that happens or not, we’ll see.
But my point was regardless of the damage it will do to Florida, that move clearly hurt Disney too.
They aren’t looking to make things worse or continue fighting him right now.
There's a difference between fascism and corruption.
DeSantis may well be a fascist, but this looks a lot more like traditional American political corruption.
If you are talking about the debt it sounds like he is trying to find a way where it does not end up being absorbed by Florida.
Whether he can or not remains to be seen.
Also hear rumours Disney would pull out of Florida, but I think that is unlikely at least anytime soon as they have a massive footprint there.
Is there more I haven’t heard yet?
But my point was Disney is still focused on this that I doubt they are going to do or say anymore for the time being.
In the current economy and financial losses being reported, they are hurting so not a great time for them to take on anymore fights that could lead to surprises.
