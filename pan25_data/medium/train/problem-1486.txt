In the case of the tsavo lions they put much much more effort into killing humans than they would hunting they typical prey even despite the shortage of standard prey.
These animals would scale thorn walls, barricades, and evade sentries to reach their victims.
What makes them especially notable is that through it was found that one of the lions had an abscess which made devouring its standard prey difficult.
Again the animal discovered than humans were very soft and thus didn’t cause it nearly as much pain as devouring its standard prey animals would.
I never said big cats didn’t hunt humans if given the opportunity but the likelihood of them going after humans again after successfully killing and eating one rises dramatically.
We've got mountain lions in my area, but they don't really go after people.
Pets are taken by wildlife fairly often though.
Wolves are just as frightened of people.
We wiped them out more because they were competition for game.
They've been reintroduced in my state.
Yes I think it's wildly hypocritical to reintroduce in the mountain West, but not, say, the Northeast.
Screams nimby imo.
Upstate NY has way too many deer.
