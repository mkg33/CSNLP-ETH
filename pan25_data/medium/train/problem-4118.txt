Sounds like some serious coping to me.
You guys lost Congress in 2018, lost the White House in 2020, and then barely won back the House by the smallest margin possible in what was supposed to be a historic red wave.
Now you've got Trump continuing to hold the party by the balls and the GOP remains too cowardly and feckless to kick him to the curb.
I'm not worried at all about 2024 because the Republican party is in total fucking shambles and Trump will again be the nominee.
And that's not even getting into the fact that the GOP is facing a demographic nightmare as its boomer voting base is dying off and being replaced by progressives.
It doesn't matter whether it's Biden or a fucking ham sandwich, the Dems will keep the white House in 2024 and most likely take back the House.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
