I was too young to be aware enough of politics to be able to comment on if he was actually being run out of Indiana, but I can say if he was then Trump definitely rehabilitated him enough that the outlook for him continuing his career here was terrifyingly good.
My mom's Trump loving coworkers would always talk about how much they loved him because he's such a perfect christian and would support him in literally any race he wanted to run in.
But Trump also destroyed him, and now Indiana MAGA hates him for being a traitor.
He also lost his chance to try to capture the non-MAGA republicans because he's an invertebrate trying to play both sides by criticizing Trump a tiny bit but refusing to outright condemn him either.
So yeah, he literally has no following left.
MAGA hates him for not being extremist enough to overturn elections, other republicans hate him because he's spineless, and everyone else hates him because he's Mike Pence.
