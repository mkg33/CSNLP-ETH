I don't understand the downvotes here.
The point you raise is an important one.
To my knowledge, the divide you're highlighting is similar to the differences in healthcare between Germany and the UK.
In the UK there is a truly universal system, while in Germany there are public and private options, and both have merit.
I think a system that includes a significant public option while allowing room for a private option, if run correctly (which is a big if in this country) represents an alternative most American's could get behind, as it wouldn't be a complete departure to our system, while also having a major provider (the public option) which could negotiate with healthcare providers/drug manufacturers to provide healthcare at a reasonable price.
The benefits of this is it still has private options for providing more expensive therapies, while also having a public option which would provide necessary medical care to everyone.
Think of this as people w/ diabetes being able to get automated pumps that regulate their insulin for them, vs having to check blood sugar and administer insulin themselves as the private and public options, respectively.
