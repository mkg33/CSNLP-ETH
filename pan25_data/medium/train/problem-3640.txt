What sticks out for me in the article is the couple being told changing info on the timeline to get an emergency abortion.
Perhaps someone was more concerned about prosecution.
The article states the couple lacks the funds to travel and have rarely left the state in their lifetime.
I point that out for those saying to just go to a blue state.
Even if they had the funds and could travel, why should people have to journey far from home for healthcare????
Imagine we made a few other healthcare procedures like that?
