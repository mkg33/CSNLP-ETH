Whole generations of kids have grown up NOT having to do the math and logistics of where they will secure an abortion should their birth control fail.
Now they have to cross state lines.
They have grown up with a certain calculus in terms of abortion security.
Every time they have sex they have to think about it in a completely new light.
They have married and had kids.
And every time they have sex with their husbands, they are forced to understand that forced birth doesn't exclude them.
Because conservatives have now stated, without equivocation, that the mere act of sex is consent to carry, labor, birth, and recover from childbirth.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
