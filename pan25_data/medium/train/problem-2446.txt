This whole attempt to ban wide swaths of firearms isn't going to work.
The Canadian Handgun Ban itself isn't going to work and is jet fuel for the American NRA who justifies itself on the idea that the US government would also ban handguns and self-defense.
It will especially not work when Canada's ruling party is a minority, and the whole country seems very divided over it's future which Trudeau has failed to meaningfully facilitate following the SNC Scandal/AG firing.
Odd that when you have a knee-jerk reaction and try to bully through idiotic legislation, people reject it.
I'd bet that if the First Nations hadn't spoken up, it would still be in there.
Rural for the most part doesn't.
Majority of the population lives in the sprawling cities and suburbs.
That's where the votes are - at least a the national level.
That's the important context.
Trudeau can't expect Canadians to respect him going door-to-door collecting firearms when he fired his AG for investigating him and when he has RCMP going door-to-door removing indians for oil drilling and gas pipelines.
He needs Canadian gun owners more than they need him, either to run the bulldozers taking out native communities or to run the native communities independently from American oil companies.
