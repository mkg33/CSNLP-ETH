For those who have questions regarding any media outlets being posted on this subreddit, please click to review our details as to our approved domains list and outlet criteria.
The fundamental rock bottom truth of any media source is A: They are doing it for money, not for you, and B: Even if they have the best intentions or standards, they will make mistakes, push stories before all the details are out, and editorialize, because they are staffed by human beings.
If your standard for trustworthy media is above these bars, too bad, you don't live in reality.
Further, if you refuse to distinguish between entities operating within the above constraints, and entities deliberately selling rage bait/click bait/outright fabrications, you are also not living in reality.
