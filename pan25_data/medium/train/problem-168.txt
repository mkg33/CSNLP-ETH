Not against any help for devastated people, but it shouldn’t the rich Arabs countries offer and act such things first.
Look at Ukraine war, I haven’t read that those Arabs countries offer helping refugees from Ukraine in any matters, and they are mostly keep silent about war if they siding with Russia.
This is accurate, but to give credit where it’s due: Saudi Arabia has sent six planes’ worth of material humanitarian aid to Turkey and 569,000 Saudi Arabian citizens raised a total of $51.2 million for survivors (as of yesterday); UAE businesses and the UAE Red Crescent have engaged in sizable philanthropic/fundraising drives while its royal family has donated roughly $13.6 million to Turkey and organised 22 planes with 640 tonnes of aid for both Turkey and Syria; Kuwait has sent firefighting and military teams and pledged $30 million for relief efforts in Turkey and Syria; Bahrain has dispatched military teams and a SAR team; and Qatar’s Emir has donated $13.7 million to survivors in Turkey and Syria.
No doubt they could do more (Qatar spent $200 billion on the World Cup), especially in the way of long-term relief like offering refuge, but they haven’t entirely sat on their asses, either.
