I think it’s counterproductive to hold grudges for centuries, the only thing that matters is what this country is doing today.
Ukrainians can forgive and that’s another example to illustrate the fact that Russian claims about our nationwide xenophobia is BS.
It is true that russophobia is more common, but tbf they haven’t stopped acting like assholes, unlike Poland.
And even then, there wasn’t as much of it as Russia pretends there was.
Even after what they started in 2014 (not to mention the more subtle stuff they continued doing after the fall of the USSR), most people who spoke Russian continued to do so and weren’t discriminated against (in my entire life, I haven’t seen a person discriminated for speaking Russian other than a teacher telling students that they should speak Ukrainian in the Ukrainian language class), we continued doing business with Russia, and Russians could still visit our country safely.
After Feb 24 it did become a different thing, but can you blame people for hating a country that commits war crimes against your people in front of you every day?
How can UK quarrel with France if Germany destroys France?
I mean, it's common knowledge France needs to exist to quarrel with France.
It's in UK's best interest to keep France alive so they can continue to quarrel.
