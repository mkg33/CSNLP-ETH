At least they don't celebrate the murders of children; every society has freaks and extremists like these settlers, but Israeli society as a whole doesn't support them.
Lol how can you say Israeli society doesn't support settlers when it legalized and consistently allows them to expand settlements?
The same way I can say that US society supports the right of a woman to access abortion, despite the way parts of its government have stripped those rights.
I think both of these sides are at fault, i put more emphasis on Isreal cause theyve got US backing and still behave like depots towards Palestinians.
Lmao you really are in total denial even when the evidence is laid out in front of you.
At best what you're saying is that Trump's support of Israel allowed Israelis to express their true sentiments.
I think "both sides" isn't a good argument, and especially when only one side regularly specifically targets children, and then celebrates their death.
I think "both sides no matter what" is a cover for something else people know they can't get away with saying here.
Im not making an argument, im condemning a group of murderous racists, for killing member of a group of murderous racists.
It sounds like you have a low opinion of everyone involved, and simply relish the excuse to act in a way that would otherwise lead to a ban at the very least.
I see a lot of that here, people LOVE to attach themselves to "good causes" so they can get away with their existing impulses.
I guess that's the best you could hope to reply with, it isn't as though you can acknowledge or discuss what it means that Palestinians regularly celebrate the murder of children.
