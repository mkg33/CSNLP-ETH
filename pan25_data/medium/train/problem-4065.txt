I can’t remember seeing a single ad in favor of Tim Ryan, but I sure do think of the ad where the guy says “TAXING Tim Ryan” every time I see his name, even though I voted for Ryan, lol.
I saw the same JD Vance ad about breakfast being too expensive because of Joe Biden Tim Ryan and Nancy Pelosi 20 times last night during the Cavs game.
The electorate in this state is literally too stupid to parse through that kind of bullshit, sorry.

Notice how democrats are watching?
Watching...
I don't see the DNC or it's "troops" rallying to get the vote out.
I see more republicans slandering the left than anything else on television.
Why aren't they DOING something, instead of watching?
This makes no sense to me at all.
Are we going to lose the House now?
Then what?
Come on folks.
If the people with the money aren't going to get the vote out, let us do it Vote, people, vote!
