Yeah you do, but the thing about reducing the deficit us how easy it is to lie about the numbers.
The easiest way to reduce the deficit is not to reduce spending or bring in more money, you just adjust the budget and make it higher.
If you raise the budget by a margin greater than inflation would indicate, you will still go over but your deficit (gap between spending and the budget limit) will go down.
If you project a budget of 5 trillion and spending of 7, your deficit is 2 trillion.
Easy fix is to budget for 5.5 trillion instead amd soend the dame amount, then stick a feather in your hat about how you shaved half a trillion off the deficit.
