I live in the US, have had an okay-ish job for the last 8 years and in December finally landed what I would consider a great job (making over $25 an hour with no education past high school) and the work itself is essentially baby sitting machines and making sure its flowing fix any problems to keep it flowing, One of the best manufacturers in the entire state of Wisconsin if you ask me and I wouldnâ€™t even consider having children because of the financial burden.
We (me 30 fiance 29) just purchased a home thanks to finding one with a MIL suite already built into the basement and my fiance's mother in law putting down 100k from the sale of her old house to live down there with us.
Otherwise I think for us it was getting to the point where it would've been impossible as well.
I feel for people who don't have options like we have because it really truly was becoming like a cancer in my brain stressing about the idea that I might be just in the neverending cycle of constantly increasing rents to where I would never be able to catch up with my wage increases.
