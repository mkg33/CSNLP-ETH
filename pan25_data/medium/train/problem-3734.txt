probably start by trying to get consensus of what the Hawaiians want… not an easy task in itself.
Some options could be functioning as an independent protectorate or an entirely sovereign nation, or even retaining statehood with some provisions for independent governance, but in my opinion it should be up to the Hawaiians with the united states recognizing that the nation was annexed illegally by corporate interests against the will of the local government and without the permissions of congress or the executive branch.
>The People's Republic of China's stance on Crimea is based upon its longstanding policy of non interference in the domestic affairs of other nations.
China sees the Crimean problem as an issue that should be solved within Ukraine.
And thus, China argues that neither the involvement of Russia nor NATO is legitimate.
In the United Nations, China abstained from condemning the referendum in Crimea as illegal.
China does not recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea and recognizes Crimea as a part of Ukraine.
