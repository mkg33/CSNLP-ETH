What does anything they say matter?
Finland and Sweden made an agreement with the Turkish government.
They were doing what Turkey wanted them to do, and I'm sure that deal didn't have any clause saying "if some nutbag burns a koran, all bets are off!
".
It's not like Sweden could or would have done anything different vis-a-vis protests.
Most likely, Finland would have done anything differently if the protests happened there, either.
It's all so utterly divorced from any rationality or legitimate concerns that how are you supposed to deal with them?
If you couldn't be a NATO member if someone burned a Koran in your country, there wouldn't be many left.
Nor if you excluded countries that housed any Kurds or Turkish opposition figures.
Plenty of those in the USA, Germany, UK, France etc.
TL;DR: Not only does this have nothing to do with suitability as a NATO member, the Turks are just arbitrary and unserious here, and this just underlines it.
Turkey has an election in May.
Refusing to let Sweden in is a political ploy to appear like he doesn't take orders from the west, and give a boost to his voter base.
Its a tactic that even the most liberal democracies use during election season.
By July or August, he's going to announce that Sweden has fulfilled the agreed-upon terms and be willing to have both Sweden and Finland join.
I guarantee it.
