The past what 5 shutdowns we're blained on Republicans even going back to the Obama era where Ted Cruz decided he needed to refund the ACA by his lonesome.
So republicans demanding cuts to social security and shit will be blamed on them.
That is the no part.

Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Which prominent Dems would side with republicans on this?
I was trying to think because I know that progressive Dems weren’t thrilled about the spending but I can’t see them shutting the government down over it.
Can’t even really see the Dems from splitting their messaging that they’re anything but United (except behind closed doors) while the Republican Party is shattering.
But in the long term even with all these antics that destable the US economy that only Republicans pull for some reason the country as a gestalt sees them as better on the economy because "America" and they think social spending and taxing companies will hurt the economy, I mean just ask Europe ... Oops.
That's the yes.
