Mobility kill is a thing too, but it usually is for describing a vehicle that can still fight but not move, while mission kill implies completely out of action.
I forget what documentary I was watching specifically, but they were interviewing a Bradley commander from the first gulf war.
A pair of Bradleys caught a number of entrenched T-72s off-guard and annihilated them with TOWs.
The 25mm Cannon is more or less useless against the armor, but it'll still scare the piss out of a tank crew when they're being pounded repeatedly in the turret by it.
The 25mm autocannon has several reported kills on T-72s, but the number is small.
I believe it though.
At close range, the autocannon can be deadly because you get more chances to hit things like periscopes, the turret ring, and other less armored areas.
A Bradley is also more likely to be hitting the side armor, just due to doctrine.
Edit: Found it!
It was "The Gulf War: How To Win A Tank Battle During A Sandstorm" by War Stories.
