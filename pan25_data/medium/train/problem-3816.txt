No, he just bribed a bunch of parties in to backing him and got the premiership and the ability to screw with the police and company before he could get sentenced.
The Israeli PM can't pardon anyone.
Israel has a president (currently Isaac Herzog) which has a mostly ceremonial & non-political role which includes pardoning convicted persons.
Herzog comes from the left side of Israeli politics so not much of a chance we'll see him pardoning Netanyahu either.
BUT, the Israeli left has been dead in the water since the mid-90s, when following peace treaties signed by the left wing Israeli government of the time & the PLO were followed by a murderous wave of suicide bombings by Hamas, killing up to dozens of innocent civilians every single week for years on end.
Ever since then, the political left in Israel is largely identified in the public eye with bringing on murderous terrorism and fear.
Netanyahu & the Israeli right in general have been cruising on that sentiment ever since, as Hamas only grew in power since then and never moved away from their genocidal ideology.
Nationalism itself is not necessarily a right/left thing, it just became one as conservative forces like Otto von Bismarck wrapped themselves in the flag and then it just kept going long enough that somehow the right is seen as more nationalist.
Also, out of all the stereotypes I've seen about Jews, "normal and straightforward" doesn't really exist.
I agree with the nationalism part, but Israel is a conservative nation.
It is founded on the idea that Israel has the right to exist based on false biblical principles.
