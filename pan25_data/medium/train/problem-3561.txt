If there was a WW3 the US would be fucked if it took them 2 years to boost production of rather fundamental missiles and rockets.
In a real shooting war involving the US and her allies and other large nations, the US would have to increase their production 20-fold and do it in less than 6 months.
I wonder if this is even possible given that a single exotic chip or other component in a highly complex missile will mean that the missile won't be built at all?
Yes, we do write them checks, it's what helps them pay their civil servants, and soldiers, and food and medical supplies for families, and care for their wounded, and school programs for children, and a whole plethora of other things foreign aid is for, because their economy has been absolutely destroyed by Russia's invasion and they need cash.
This is also a tiny pittance compared to our national defense budget, and our return on investment for having Ukraine defend themselves is a huge win for our national defense, so it is all money well spent.
