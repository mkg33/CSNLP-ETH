That's barbaric as well.
There's also still people pushing in favor of child marriage and child workers in the USA.

When you say "Being murdered is often better than being crippled," you're heading towards, "I'd rather be dead than be disabled."
Which is a hell of a stray bullet for disabled people who are just trying to live their nice lives.
Honestly being murdered is often better than being crippled also what happens if you are left handed do they always amputate the right hand or the dominant hand.
I am a chemist I have seen what kind of disabilities you can get in my line of work some of them are probably worse than death.

Not in a western country no but in a country that is basicly stuck in the dark age.
Where you can get your hand chopped off do you think people will support him he is no a literaly branded criminal you realy think his community will support somebody like that heck do you think his community supports anybody.
I'm also calling out "Do you think his community will support anybody."
Yeah, I do.
They're people.
Sometimes people help people.
I'd like to think it be more like the handmaids tale.
Very clean and modern hospital but very barbaric practices.
Sudan isn't "stuck in the Dark Ages" as though they never got the printing press.
Sudan has cities, music, sports leagues, etc.
It also has poverty caused by war, the slave trade, and intermittent dictatorships.
Calling an African country "the Dark Ages" is not great.
