November 30, 2022 – The Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen (BRS) strongly opposes the proposal of the United States Senate extending our National Negotiations.
The hardworking men and women represented by the BRS have sacrificed time away from their families and their own health to keep the economy afloat through the pandemic.
During this round of negotiations, the Railroads have achieved record profits and pay outs beyond those ever accomplished in history.
In that same three years, our members have received nothing except the answer “NO" to any reasonable request while watching their coworkers get injured, have their jobs cut or being forced to resign for the sake of putting their family above the draconian practices of the Railroads.
