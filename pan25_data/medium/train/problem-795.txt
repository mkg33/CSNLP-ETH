I'm a little puzzled as to where you seem to be going with this, you seem to agree that felons are allowed to have guns in TX, correct?
Curious that Abbott cares about this issue now.
I remember seeing this happen multiple times over the last few years in Houston, and the state government didn't care.
I hope the police can stop these events.
Street racing is very dangerous.

Guns for everybody!
