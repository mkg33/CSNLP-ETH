One thought I keep coming back to is how, in the weeks leading up to Election Day we were seeing so many polls favoring the Republicans winning, which was clearly part of their strategy.
I wonder if that perhaps ended up backfiring on them.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Perhaps relying on a bunch of questionable polls to project a resounding victory was not a great move on their part.
Regardless of if those polls made any difference in turnout, they left the impression that Republicans were going to make major gains, retaking both chambers of Congress, humiliating Biden and the Democrats, and putting them on a better strategic track for the 2024 Presidential election.
But since none of that actually even happened, but they set up that expectation, it definitely seems to have made a difference in how both parties have reacted to the results.
Dems are even more motivated than ever.
GOP are basically at each others' throats.
