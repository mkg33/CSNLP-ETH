Fair point.
I speak from a purely pragmatic point of view, real change will only come from sustained pressure towards our governments to press these corporations.
Pissing off the average person only weakens that pressure.
But I agree, even going through the correct channels has moved climate reform at a glacial pace.
Activism is used to raise awareness, and at this point everyone is aware of the issue.
So these people are simply virtue signaling narcissists who should instead be doing something actually beneficial.
If anything it is counter productive, people will read the news and associate climate activism with these fools.
It’s the same with sitting in traffic to raise awareness.
You are turning the common man against you, which is enough excuse for big corporations to turn a blind eye.
Why make a change when all the focus is on these lunatics.
They do this to feel important, to feel as if they have done something of measure.
Something they can pat themselves on the back about and say ‘I am a good person’.
It’s a purely selfish endeavour.
