Doesn't even need to be by an Argentinian--you could get pregnant there and give birth here and get legal residency right away and citizenship after that.
(I'd recommend paying for the birth at a private clinic, though--I read somewhere that they don't offer epidurals at public hospitals!
).
It usually depends on your health coverage.
If you don't have a coverage, they will apply an epidural on medical advice but not on demand.
But I think this only happens on general clinics, motherhood centers offer epidural on medical authorization but not on advice.
You're actually supposed to give birth in motherhood centers (they're public and free), general clinics are mostly for cases of emergency or capacity.
That's not trying to give them any credit for the state of their economy, but your comparison is too extreme.
"I would rather be poor in America than poor in Argentina" is as far as I can go.
I disagree.
Middle class Argentinians have maids and nice houses.
A poor American can't even go to the doctor.
