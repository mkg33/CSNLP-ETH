r/collapse has quite a few incompetent commenters.
The readers vote almost entirely based on feeling.
Post "OMG millions will die" and you get upvotes.
Post "at least a billion survivors will be able to subsist on the remaining arable land" and you get downvoted.
Few see any contradiction here.
All feedback loops on r/collapse have to be positive feedback (amplifiers) there cannot be any negative feedbacks moderating climate.
There is no possible buffer and no sink in one thread.
In the next there is the buffer that is currently masking the full effect of the crisis but will soon be overwhelmed.
There was a sink which is now going to be a reservoir of doom.
And then you've got people in the third world who's only concern is, how are they going to eat today.
They're NEVER going to be concerned with the environment.
It's never going to be on their radar.
And they're the majority.
Written by someone who thinks people are rational and reasonable.
Individuals are rational and reasonable.
People as a whole are like teenagers who want their toys now, they want to eat what they want to eat, now, and they don't have time to make allowances for the environment.
