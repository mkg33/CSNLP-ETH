I know some members of Florida’s democratic state party, and according to them the party nationally didn’t give them “enough” money and they are angry.
As someone involved in party politics and while progressive, pretty “establishment,” I say good.
That money is better spent in GA, WI, MI, and PA.
Florida has been dead to me since 2000.
The Florida Dems need to get their house in order before getting a dime of out of state money.
Val Demings raised 72 million and still lost by 16 points, at that point even an infinite amount of money will not fix the complete dumpster fire that is the Florida Democratic Party.
And neither of them actually are bad candidates if you were watching them in debates and listening to them as anyone remotely democratic or progressive.
Put them in any other state and in any other race and they would have absolutely crushed it.
Crist and Demings were both aggressive and on point in their debates against Rubio and DeSantis but the red wave happened in Florida more so than any other state.
