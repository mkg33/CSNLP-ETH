You have it all wrong.
McConnell is a master game player, Trump was but his pawn.
Granted, he miscalculated the degree to which trump would go to retain power resulting in unforeseen consequences as the clock runs out, but that really is immaterial.
The prize was and is not just the presidency but the Supreme Court.
McConnell has what he wants; overturning Roe and tax cuts for the rich under the pretense of helping middle class Americans.
All done to ensure the GOP will always be in power to support the oligarchs, seen and unseen.
We only see what he wants us to see.
No one makes a move without his say so.
He cares not for that fool and is working behind the scenes to make sure heâ€™s out.
DeSantis is the golden boy, smarter and less fuss than Potatus.
Make no mistake, Donny will go at it again making trouble every step of the way.
But things have a way of working themselves out with a little help under the guise of nature taking its course.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
