It goes like 500km\hour and anything past ww1 Anti air can shoot it down.
Pilots also had to use binoculars for spotting and would use missiles and rockets and won't even use their guns as MANPDAS would fuck them up.
They basically took the greatest machine gun ever made, glued to a titanium bathtub to it and strapped on two jet engines and said, "Will this work?
".
Edit: folks you’re reading too much into this.
I was making a hypothetical where the US somehow was _forced_ to enter the conflict and a scenario where Russia isn’t stupid enough to engage with nukes.
And I was being hyperbolic when I said a weekend.
This isn’t supposed to be a thought experiment where I’m trying to analyze and break down the logistics and the likelihood of certain events in the potential involvement of the US in the Russia-Ukraine war.
We keep joking about stuff like this but the reality _really is_ that if Russia were to drag the US into direct involvement in Ukraine and if they kept fighting the way they have been, Russia would get absolutely rekt.
I think the US could retake the whole of Ukraine in a weekend with things as they currently stand.
