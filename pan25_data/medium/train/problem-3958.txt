Yeah no.
They had fiduciary duty and they utterly failed it mostly likely because of the kickbacks the CEO funneled their way: “Investors like Goldman Sachs and Blumberg Capital—which had board seats and led funding rounds into Slync totaling $80 million, valuing the company at $240 million—appear to have taken no action when, on three occasions, executives were fired after approaching the board with concerns.”.
Not that I think Goldman Sachs needs or deserves anyone sticking up for them, but the title of this article makes it seem like they had something to do with the fraud that occurred.
They didn’t, they were just the investment bank who floated the shares.
The CEO of the company — Slync — basically looted $28m from investors for his own personal use, lied repeatedly to his board of directors and fired any staff person who questioned what he was doing.
He also took that money at a time when they otherwise didn’t have enough to make payroll and employees were going months without pay.
GS has done plenty of sleazy shit, but in this case it sounds like they were just as bamboozled by this guy as everyone else.
