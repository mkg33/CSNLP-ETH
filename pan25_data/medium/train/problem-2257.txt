I was on staff there at Pioneer during that year as an incoming staff member.
I witnessed the strangling, the laughing by the older staff, the throwing the poor thing off the back balcony behind the staff area, and attempt to cut its throat, but NOT there for the final blow that killed the poor pup.
I was a kid, I knew what was happening was wrong, reported it, protested, but nothing I could do as a easily pushed around 16 yr old.
If only I could go back in time with the confidence I have now.
Everytime this story resurfaces, it makes me smile.

Sheer stupidity.
