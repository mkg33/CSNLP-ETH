He once called Elmer Fudd a Nimrod, implying sarcastically that Fudd was a "great" hunter.
People didn't get the sarcasm, and for 50 years have used nimrod as an insult meaning idiot, changing its meaning.
He wasn't just a mighty hunter.
He was also well known for being a dumbshit who inherited a mighty empire, and then fucked it up by trying to attack an enemy he could never defeat, but planning so poorly that not only did his effort fail, in addition, everything he built literally crumbled apart and his empire broke up into countless small independent states, each with their own languages....
There's also a big red button on the presidents desk that blows up every connecting road connection, bridge and railroad to russia, and 80 years of preparations for a russian invasion.

My understanding is that Hungary are currently holding up Finlands entry into NATO, because the present rules require unanimity.
Maybe NATO need to think about changing that rule ?
