Once Ukraine takes back all of Crimea and any territory the Russians claimed to have annexed, the war will be over.
Russia can then start the process of paying for the damages and figuring out how to be a country that doesnâ€™t invade its neighbors and accepting that this will not happen again ever if it wants to be an accepted part of the international community.
Otherwise it has no place except as a pariah state.
And Putin must go.
Out a window is fine but he must go.
This is laughable and childish.
The Russians can end the war at any time.
All they have to do is stop their aggression, withdraw their troops, and enter talks with Ukraine.
They are just having a tantrum because they can't have it all their own way.
they are right though.
we are prolonging this war by not just letting Ukraine have access to our long range missles, drones, fighters, and just now letting them start using some of our armored vehicles.
if we did that sooner, they probably would have sent russia home crying by now.
