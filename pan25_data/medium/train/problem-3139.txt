Not to mention completely shattering the world's perception of their military might.
So many works of fiction made their military look to be cutting edge with highly trained soldiers, but actual combat footage has shown that they're anything but.
They went into Ukraine with old and poorly maintained gear and ineffective troops that didn't even know why they were there.
I don’t think those that were in the know ever thought Russia was cutting edge.
Russia was number 2 simply because of nukes.
Their military is almost entirely still.
Nah, US military had absolutely no problem taking and holding ground, the problems came down to politicians and bureaucracy constantly undermining the military with extra tasks and a poorly defined objective.
Point only being the US military was competent, it was the politicians that turned it from an unnecessary war to an endless and profoundly stupid one.
Soviet era shit that was outdated in 1991.
All of their new fancy stuff was just for military parades, the actual money for “production” was going into Putin and oligarch pockets.
You're talking about people who either extensively studied the subject or who were given detailed briefs, complete with potentially classified information, as part of their job.
I'm talking about the general public, those who have long believed Russia to be a strong military power due to the countless pieces of media that have portrayed them as such over the past 70+ years.
