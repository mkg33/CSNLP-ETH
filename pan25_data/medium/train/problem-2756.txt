This asshat was the source of rampant corruption at the Department of the Interior when he was its Secretary under The Great Orange One, but, because Dear Leader was a master in blatantly breaking the law in broad daylight, Zinke flew under the radar.
He was pretty much at the center of the largest corruption scandal in the DoI's history since Tea Pot Dome (you know, the one that likely would have ended the Harding administration had Harding not had to good fortune to die in office, which was also the largest political scandal in American history prior to Watergate?
), and because he's a Republican that means he got a promotion and is now in the fucking House.
