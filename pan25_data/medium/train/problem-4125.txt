There is actually no law that will disqualify Trump from running or being elected President.
Impeachment followed by conviction was probably the best bet, but the qualifications for President are laid out in the Constitution and they donâ€™t mention anything about felony convictions.
Unfortunately any attempt to disqualify Trump based on a provision in the law would absolutely be challenged on Constitutional grounds.
And the GOP would not be patiently waiting for the decision from the 6-3 Supreme Court.
