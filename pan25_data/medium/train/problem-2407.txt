I lived in NY for 25 years and am aware of the rural components as well as the politics at large in the state(I still keep up).
Those tend to be conservative places, not really democrats.
They would not have went for the toughest gun laws in the country if they were what you were saying.
For years it was difficult to travel with a gun until that got brought to the courts, like other ones of their gun laws.
In many areas it is difficult to get things like pistols and the SAFE act is incredibly confusing(almost by design).
NY in general is incredibly hostile towards self defense, if you defend yourself with a gun, you will most likely still go to jail even if it was justified, you have a "duty to retreat" in NY.
Why does the New York Democratic Party suck so bad?
And I say this coming from the state with what is arguably the 2nd worst state Democratic Party, Texas.
I mean, here, the state party is merely weak and completely ineffective.
The NY party seems to be actively anti-Democratic Party.
