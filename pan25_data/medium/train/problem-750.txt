That wasn't their point, anyway the reason things cost so little are because hundreds of other retailers knock their prices down repeatedly to compete with each other so they get chosen, it's not like a company went to a retailer and forced them to sell for such small prices, they simply picked from the options that those retailers were offering, because they all want to get picked they're not going to ask for a wage befitting a completely different country, otherwise another retailer will swoop in with a lower price and get the business, as that happens over and over you eventually get to prices relative to the country they're being made in.
Owners don't just sell on the international market and make a killing, that's not how retail economics works, they sell to another company, who sells to another company ect ect until the prices are inflated.
Some people try to cut out all of that middle bureaucracy by shipping straight from the source, but with the amount of checks and balances there are to do so it's a ton of effort and investment.
It’s about 50% of the average wage, which seems fair for what constitutes a minimum wage job.
It’s just enough to live on if you are a single adult.
Doesn’t seem too bad all things considered.
Comparative to cost of living it’s about $23/hour for an American.
