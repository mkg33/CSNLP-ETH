As a Michigander, I can tell y'all that the only reason the Democrats won BIG this midterm was because we passed a prop that has an independent body draw up the voting districts.
This is the entire reason why for the first time in almost 40 years Michigan has a blue legislature.
We passed a similar prop in Utah but then the legislature ignored the maps drawn by the independent redistricting committee and just voted for their own maps anyways.
That's what happens in a deep red state where there's a super majority in both houses.
