"See, I slightly beat up my neighbor several times asking him nicely to kill himself so I could get all his stuff but he wouldn't comply so I just had to do it all by myself, why don't you understand??
Everyone here just wants to bully me".
I’m giving Ukraine a wide berth on any moral issues.
They are fighting for their survival as a people and country.
They were forced into this situation with the Russian invasion and I’m not going to make any moral or legal judgments against them as long as the Russian invasion is going on.
Russia get out of Ukraine.
Yesterday there was some quote from someone high up in Russia, along the lines of "Ukraine can stop the suffering if they just surrendered our territory that we occupied".
The Russian troops right now are draftees, and they are ill-trained and poorly equipped.
The Russian winter is going to kick Russia's ass.
Ukrainian units can get air-drops of supplies, but the Russians are going to get droned while they are hungry and cold.
Russia fears losing any more aircraft and precious pilots, so...no air-drops for them!
