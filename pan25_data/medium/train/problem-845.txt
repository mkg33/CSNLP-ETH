Zhilin had to cross the border illegally as he knew that, as an FSB officer, he would not be allowed to leave the country.
He asked for political asylum, but his request was rejected by Kazakh authorities and he was arrested.
He probably swallowed bribes that were supposed to go to Ukrainian politicians, and got found out and are about to be sent to the frontline to “redeem” himself.
They need a lot of officers there right now for counter intelligence.
No matter where he ends up, asset handler, case officer, analyst or even in an active team at the front, he will be a high value target.
Also, they can always need officers to sacrifice as scapegoats.
Yeah, and the Russians are actively proving that their monsters for what they’re doing in Ukraine.
I’m just saying that tactically speaking, sending them back is only going to add to the radicalization of Russians.
It’s not the “responsibility” of any country to accept the refugees, but it’d be a nice hit the Russian economy.
Living in a tyrannical dictatorship is not the same as supporting the tyrannical dictatorship.
I like how you're so certain that all these fleeing refugees just love their government so much.
I never said it’s Russophobia to hate them for killing Ukrainians, I said it’s stupid to make the ones who don’t want to kill Ukrainians go back and fight the Ukrainians?!
How is this even controversial in the slightest?
What?
I’m not talking about the ones fighting, I’m talking about the ones running away from their dictatorship?
How tf is that the same as fighting for your country?
What were they supposed to do?
Kill the entire Russian army by themselves?
How do you know they supported the war?
Apparently not!
What about the LGBTQ community?
Should they all just stay and be sent to prison for existing?
And if not, how do you justify allowing one group of people flee Russia for the safety of themselves and their family but not the other group?
