"Why would the democrat candidate for governor get more votes than the democrat candidate for Senate.
It makes no sense.
".
Guess what, Einsteins?
There are people who vote split ticket or just don't vote at all in certain races if they don't like the candidates.
If anything, that's a proof of no fraud.
Why would Democrats cheat to win some offices and lose others?
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Much more so in 2020.
There were 3 very very winnable senate seats and couple somewhat winnable seats that would be upsets and Democrats could only got 50.
I'm a whiny broken record, but under slightly different circumstances, Democrats could very 60 seats this January!
Obviously nothing to do with Evers being more well known as the incumbent govenor running for the same office again, while Barnes was less known as the sidekick to Evers who ran for a much higher federal position.
He's trying to imply that we are racist and that's why a guy who had a ceremonial position based mostly on waiting for an old man to die didn't win a race for being our Senator in Washinon, while a guy who was the leader of our state won a race where he was just trying to keep the same job.
Apparently this is completely unexplainable outside of racism.
