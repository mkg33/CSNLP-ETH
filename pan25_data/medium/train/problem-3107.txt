It's fair to assume that every embargoed variety of oil is being surreptitiously integrated into the stream of crude oil all over the world.
Shell was selling "Latvian Blend" out of their Latvian shipping locations, which was Russian oil cut with JUST over 50% another variety.
It was then technically no longer "Russian crude."
Ship to ship transfers, transponders shut off, it's all a farce.
It makes it harder for the countries involved, and costs them money, but the oil is being sold in a variety of ways.
The point of sanctions is to weaken an economy in order to convince either the leadership to end a behaviour (war) or to convince the populace to end the behaviour (war) by removing and replacing the leadership.
Cutting the countries main revenue stream in half is an effective way to cripple an economy.
It works even better when you can get globalized corporations to leave that country due to the threat of sanctions or consumer reactions.
China provides global manufacturing for just about every major company in every country.
Sanctioning them would cost trillion or atleast cause significant economic instability.
Sanctioning them would cut trade and result in every item made in china to go up in price significantly, assuming they dont simply boot companies that sell or are from the sanctioning country.
Basically noone can comfortably afford to sanction china.
However if they do something that could upset the market, like attacking a major semiconductor manufacturer, then a significant response would be had to protect the market.
At the cost of economic comfort.
Russia provides oil.
Thats about it.
1 resource is easy enough to replace/find new sources so sanctioning them is much easier.
