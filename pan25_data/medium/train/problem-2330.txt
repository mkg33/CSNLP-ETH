Not right now they dont.
Afterwards, fine.
But not now.
It would weaken any negotiating positions, and could cause more deaths, and at worst give russian the info to break them for good.
Its hard and it sucks, but there are reasons countries keep secrets, and although it is often abused, this is not one of those circumstances.
As macabre as it sounds, when you are in charge, you need death to be a number, and not a son, brother, father, etc.
in order to do your job effectively.
Your job is trading lives, 300 for this village, 12,000 for that city, 40 for that hill, 2000 for this stretch of highway, 400 for that bridge.
A good commander uses whatever he can to his advantage and doesn't waste lives, but nothing is ever free.
Either way, the official numbers won't be revealed until after this sick war is over.
I see every day that Russian numbers are posted but any reference to Ukraine's losses is almost always removed or corrected.
I am not saying they are lying but in every war/era there is a media narrative as well.
At the end, its the people fighting and families who are losing, these numbers are just numbers to most people not realizing each number has their own story and life to tell about.
