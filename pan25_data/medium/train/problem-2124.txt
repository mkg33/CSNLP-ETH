The absolute fact of the matter is that Russia is not going to stop.
Russia can either be confronted, or given all of Eastern Europe and every one of its neighbors.
And who knows if they'll even be satisfied with that?
Negotiating is not an option.
Putin will not come to the table in good faith.
Ukraine went to the table with Putin twice, was given what it thought was concrete assurances, and got fucked twice.
The current regime in Russia is categorically incapable of honoring any peace deal.
They will never stop.
Western society has this absurd rationale that it's possible to work with anyone.
It isn't.
We have this insane naivete that everyone is playing the same game.
They aren't.
I think Western leaders are finally waking up to the undeniable fact that you cannot treat with these people.
There is no wider war here.
Russia can end all of this at the drop of a hat, but they're deciding not to.
Because Putin cares more for his personal survival than the good of the country.
I'm not saying that makes him different from leaders elsewhere, but at least in some other countries people have the ability to protest against and change their government democratically.
