I get everyone on Reddit hates China, but it's weak sauce for Trudeau to frame leaking diplomatic communications as promoting democracy and freedom, such a naive north American response.
Xi Jinping: 如果有誠心，咱們就應互相尊重的態度來進行很好的溝通。(If there is any sincerity, we should communicate with each other in a respectful manner.
).
Trudeau: In Canada we believe in free and open and frank dialogue, we will continue to have.
We will continue to work constructively together but there will be things we will disagree on.
You will have to….
As someone who voted for Trudeau twice, I could care less what a dictator thinks.
I’m not even a big follower of Canadian politics, it’s all pretty neutral and boring up here in the north.
I barely know what Trudeau gets up to, and I think that’s the case for a lot of Trudeau voters honestly, lol.
I Just found they talk about, russ vs UKr, cop15, but they dont say the content of the information, hope we have some news soon, looks very important.
I understand hating the Chinese government and authoritarian regimes, but keep an eye on how anything China themed goes over on Reddit.
It often spills over and becomes a general hatred of the people/culture/all things China because most people don't have the nuance to separate Government from Nation.
There is a reason many diplomatic exchanges aren't recorded/streamed live to the world and why many of these meetings are behind closed doors.
If every stage of a negotiation was released to the press it would be a bloodbath of emotions and attacks and problems which would hamper attempts at achieving a reasonable outcome.
Representative democracy does not mean the population is privy to every communication a politician makes, although I can see some benefits of the transparency you allude to.
