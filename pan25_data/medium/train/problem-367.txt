my impression when visiting it was always that the linguo-cultural conservativism there is also supposed to push against politically conservative anglo-american ideas, and to get into closer contact to the political ideologies of other romance-speaking languages in Europe and the Americas.

This lead to the belief Quebecers were more progressive.
We are one of two provinces that don’t allow any cannabis to be grown, which is being fought in court as it’s goes against federal law, and Quebec set the age of legal use at 21, when it’s 18 for alcohol.
