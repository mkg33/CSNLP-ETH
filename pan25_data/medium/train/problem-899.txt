Don't underestimate it.
Being able to rapidly reverse engineer and produce high end equipment is still a hell of a an advantage.
Even if they are lower quality, the logistics and manufacturing ability is still scary.
And the more they do it and learn the more they improve their industry and skill set and come up with original and superior designs.
Having a military and industry with "good enough" stuff in superior numbers and the ability to replace/support it is how the US won WW2.
Yep you can go back even further than that, during the Punic wars the Romans reverse engineered Carthaginian Trireme and Quadreme but a ton of not trained sailers on them and still managed to beat the then Naval masters the Carthaginians at sea.
The Romans didn't care about material or human loss because they could mass produce trained armies and cheap copycat ships, the Romans generals also only had 1 year tenures so they took way greater risks to try and achieve something.
The carthaginians had more experienced mercenary Armies but Generals were Generals for life and achieving unit cohesion in armies made up of mercenaries from different parts of the world took time so they were scared of taking significant human losses... end result they won tons of strategic victories often against larger forces but still ended up losing.. badly because the Romans could mass produce material and soldiers faster.
