Wait till you see a list of all the things China and Australia have been collaborating on.
China and the west have gone balls deep into each other so long that they might as well be a conjoined twin at this point.
China is a giant mindless eating machine Pac-Man consuming the world's resources at an alarming rate.
The Dahua NVR has a function called P2P which when enabled, does send information back to Chinese servers.
Anything that hits Chinese soil, the Chinese gov can have access to it.
P2P is mainly for ease of remote access for the end user.
Users won't need to port forward or update IP addresses.
All the end user has to do is enter a serial number or scan a QR code, enter password and they're now able to view their security cameras even while sitting at the park.
So users who enable/use that feature are trading for convenience at the cost of their security.
But most users don't care.
They just want to be able to easily connect/view their cameras when they're not at home.
Of-course you can air-gap the video surveillance system and keep it offline.
But the question is, are there any hidden backdoors in the system?
Can some hacker just insert a loaded USB and just bypass the NVR's security and access all recorded footage/event logs regardless of login requirements?
I highly doubt all these video surveillance systems are offline.
They're probably behind some VLAN or isolated network, so still online in a way.
And how do you trust any previous/future system/camera updates/firmware upgrades to not have any backdoors/hidden exploits?
This becomes a very important topic especially when these cameras could potentially be installed/used at army bases, government offices, power plants or any other highly sensitive sites.
