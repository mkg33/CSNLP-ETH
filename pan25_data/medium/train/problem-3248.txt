NATO, the EU and the rest of the western world needs to give Ukraine the tools to track where exactly these missiles and drones are launched from, land sea or air, and to wipe that target off the face of the earth within minutes.
Knocking them down while incoming is grand, but eliminating the enemy's ability to ever launch again should be the ultimate goal.
We actually know their locations, we just don't have long-range rockets to eliminate those planes and ships.
And the West strongly refuse to provide us ones.
Planes are put as far as they need to be.
Provide longer range missiles and they'll move them it a bit farther.
Tu-95 and 160 have a range of about 12,000 km.
They can be refueled in air.
They can easily move them a few hundred km farther.
I don't know if they did this time, but they also used submarines in the past, especially right after Ukraine sank Russian ship.
Submarines are often used.
It's not a secret Ukraine is building a fleet of unmanned sea drones to counter ships and probably submarines.
It’s time for the west to allow the Ukrainians to fire into Russian territory.
As things stand now, the west has allowed Russia to have a “privaledged sanctuary”.
The Russians piss and moan every time the Ukrainians fire into Russia.
It’s got to end.
Let the bald dwarf get upset.
Take the gloves off and allow the Ukrainians to hit Russia where it hurts.
They ruthlessly attack civilian targets.
It’s time for a “re-think”.
