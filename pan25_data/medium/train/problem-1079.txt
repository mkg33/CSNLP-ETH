Hmmm.
Sure thing Russia has features that are according to the book elements of fascism.
And yes people has been mentioning this as such over the years.
But since the war it is suddenly a done deal that a) Russia is fascist and b) as bad as Nazi Germany.
I am just not sure if this will be seen as historical correct.
Was Japan a fascist country in WO2?
Does it if you call it like that explain its behavior in similar and useful terms as it surely does for Germany?
That is my point.
It does not, even if Japan had surely many features of a fascist country.
Nationalism is not fascism perse.
Waging war neither.
Or wanting to restore or built an empire for that matter.
All those things have been done repeatedly over history by non-fascist countries that did or did not have some elements of what we now call fascism.
Put it this way.
Putin just want to win this war to go into the books as a great man (the irony).
As a result we got this ugly war.
Too many Russians share the wish to restore the empire.
They want to be great too I guess.
I do not see where fascism comes in as a useful explanation.
Well the are technically getting American Tanks, the Ukrainians will be driving them.
They figured it was the best way to deliver the American Ammo we are sending them.
