So officials are willing to debase and weaken the branches they serve in service of their party.
You get Judges like Cannon blatantly using the courts to aid her party benefactor and a Congress unwilling to hold their party's President to account for abuse of power and misconduct(of course this applies to one party more than the other, but the structural incentives still apply to both).
You also get a Congress, which was by some measures intended to be the dominant branch, that is willing to kneecap itself through internal procedure and defer its powers to the Executive.
Because winning the party battles is more important than winning the branch battles.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
