The North Carolina legislature is contesting whether or not the North Carolina Supreme Court can make rulings with regard to the constitution of North Carolina, in particular how elections are held.
The North Carolina legislature's basis for contention is based on an archaic and discredited legal theory that states can not decide how federal elections are held.
Justice Thomas has his basis in legal theory that states should be left to decide their own fates with regard to their constitutions, and in a case brought before the Supreme Court of the United States, where he was serving as a Justice, said that only state courts should judge state laws (this is paraphrased).
The lawyer representing the North Carolina Supreme Court quoted Justice Clarence Thomas to Justice Clarence Thomas, demonstrating that his decision is clear, but in reality Justice Thomas is more of a political hack than a stalwart of principle.
