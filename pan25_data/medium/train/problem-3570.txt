For that matter, why are we even using this website?
I've never heard of "News Times UK" before, and clicking the link on mobile gave my phone cancer.
Tons of popups, redirects, and scam warning messages.
I'd ask OP how they even stumbled across this article on such a scammy, no-name website, but they appear to just be a bot themselves.
So we have AI writing articles to scam people with shady ads, and we have a bot sharing it on Reddit.
Edit: It looks like OP is an extremely active bot, posting tons of stories every single day.
And they are pretty much all related to Ukraine and Russia.
Not sure if this is some official propaganda machine or just someone trying to cash in on the easy attention they will get from such a popular topic.
Also before everyone chimes in with assassination jokes, I genuinely think this is a suicide.
The western military district has gone from being the pride of Russia to getting demolished in multiple occasions.
Russia has been working everyone overtime to try and essentially rebuild it in Belarus.
Seeing a low level official commit suicide isnâ€™t that crazy of an outcome.
this is an example of my day, the names and places are fictional, and any likeness to my real code reviewers is just coincidence.
