As I understand it the problem was not publishing the information, the problem is Assange conspired with Manning.
The conspiring with Manning is why Assange is in legal trouble.
The conspiring claim says that Assange directed Manning on how to hack/steal the documents, which he did not do.
He acted as a journalist and published the information for the public.
We may never know if the conspiring claims by the US government is legitimate because its simply a way for the Government to save face after having war crimes exposed.
It did shut him up as he now fears for his life.
After they attempted false charges out of Sweden to try and get Assange out of the Embassy, I don't know how I could ever believe anything the Government has to say about Assange.
They lie more times than not.
Why wouldn't they lie about something that incriminates them to try and shift the blame of the conversation?
