In 2014, there were seven dems who voted for the Benghazi committee which was beneficial for Republicans in the 2016 election.
Sinema is one of the seven, and she is the only one of the seven who represented a district that Obama won in 2012.
She endorsed nutjob Andy Biggs in a GOP primary that he won by only 27 votes against a moderate Republican.
