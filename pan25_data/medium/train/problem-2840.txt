...let's just say that they weren't allowed to be democratic after that - and then the theocrats took power shy of 3 decades after, and they still aren't democratic.
There used to be a government that represented the democractic will of the people back in 1953 but, well....
You’d be a bit surprised I think.
How I understand it based on what I’ve read and Iranians I’ve talked to:
Iranian cities, thus the more educated and connected to the outside world, are where you get the anti-regime people.
Outside of the major cities though, Iran can very much be a backwater that would support these actions.
In many cases these people would believe the current regime isn’t going far enough in enforcing sharia/the theocratic state.
It represents a domestic population of about 10,000 Jews who, until recently, had a better quality of life than a Jewish person would have in many Middle Eastern countries.
Until very recently the Iranian govt was fairly pragmatic.
However with Trump unilaterally tearing up the nuclear disarmament deal Iran signed up for, the hardliners gained prominence over moderates.
