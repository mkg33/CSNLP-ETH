40 years ago my parents were able to pay off their college debts, not need a roommate, and could save to buy a house with jobs barely above minimum wage.
When I was in my 20s in the 2010s I made double minimum wage and couldn't afford an apartment without a roommate, was living paycheck to paycheck, had no savings despite never going out and living on the cheapest food I could, and a single medical emergency put me in debt that took me 6 years to pay off.

They want the elderly, poor and uneducated savings because its easier to take.
