When you compare law enforcement misconduct in America with other countries, it is good to ask what are other countries doing differently.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
In 2019, CAHOOTS in Eugene and Springfield, used unarmed medics and crisis workers to respond to 911 calls relating to individuals experiencing psychological crises, responding to 24,000 calls, about 20% of total 911 dispatches.
It is a benefit to both law enforcement and our communities to have law enforcement more educated and programs like CAHOOTS that will alleviate the pressure from law enforcement to respond to multiple crises.
Our approach to policing differs in several areas including organization and training.
Law enforcement in the US spend significantly less time in police academies than those in most European countries.
Basic US law enforcement training takes 21 weeks on average, and I believe it is 16 weeks in Oregon.
As a comparison, to become an Esthetician, there is a minimum of 600 hours of training that takes approximately 5 to 8 months to complete.
Law enforcement training programs in European countries can last more than three years.
Some may argue that requiring more training will make the shortage of law enforcement worse.
That is, of course, probably true in the immediate future but at what point do we pivot and acknowledge that a more educated police force would be better to address the very challenging dangerous jobs they have.
Do we really want to expect law enforcement, armed police, to respond to every hypothetical situation involving mental health crises?
