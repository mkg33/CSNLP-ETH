It's irresponsible to publish these sorts of criticisms of Porter.
If a journalist has a trustworthy source and the source does not want to be named, that is a perfectly acceptable way of sourcing information for a story.
But if the writer doesn't even know who these people are, and isn't able to verify that these people have a connection to Porter, this shouldn't be in the story.
Well.... considering the one politician they hated more than anyone else was Bernie Sanders, that's not entirely out of the question.
Would make a good subplot for the Amazon Prime series "Hunters".
