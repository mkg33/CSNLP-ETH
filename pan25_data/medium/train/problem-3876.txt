Politically that earns them some goodwill and as someone else says continued support from nations that support Ukraine defending themselves.
From a military pov that limits your options, supply lines, training areas, staging areas are all valid military targets and attacking the enemies rear limits their options on the front lines, forcing them to pull troops and air defense to the rear, supplies not reaching the front limits their offensive capabilities etc.
"We won't use NATO weapons to attack targets in Russia" has been a common refrain during this war throughout the government, even going as far as to offer NATO final approval of any targets Ukraine strikes.
I don't see that changing when that would jeopardize the long range munitions UA absolutely needs.
The alternative is to not promise that, and to then not get them at all.
If NATO missiles are used to hit Russian soil it's bad news bears.
Ukraine can still use non-NATO missiles to do exactly that.
This guy just changed his position and he's not a defense minister anymore.
They could say that we dunno what he said in the past he's not a part of the ministry of defense anymore when they'll strike rusia.
If Russia is pushed back all the way to the 1991 borders (UA is willing to fight, the only question is if we are willing to arm them appropriately) and Russia still bombards Ukraine with cruise missiles, I suspect we'd see the political calculus in the West change dramatically.
For now, better to do everything possible to stymie Putin's attempts to make this war "a great patriotic cause" for the Russian people while ramping up support to Ukraine.
