It's finally Friday!
That means it's time to kick back, drink somethingâ€”anythingâ€”that won't lead to mistakes being made on social media, and chat about whatever is on your mind.
As always remember to follow our civility rules and save any meta commentary for our modmail.
Additionally, please keep chat non-political - we want to keep these threads light and off-topic.
Making my way through Starcraft 2: Wings of Liberty on Brutal, and holy balls is this a difficulty spike from Hard.
Multiple wins solely because I managed to destroy the objective seconds before the enemy destroyed the last building in my base.
I moved to a new place in September to downsize my life and save some money.
I took a significant downgrade from my old apartment, but it was getting way too expensive, I was too sedentary, plus I had an hour round-trip commute every day.
Now I'm paying less than half of what I used to pay in rent & utilities and my office is less than a mile away.
So naturally within the last 90 days in addition to the expense of moving itself, my car died, my GPU died, and I broke a fucking tooth.
