China is arguably worse than Russia.
The economy is larger, the population is larger, the industrial base is larger, Xi is both smarter and more ruthless than Putin.
In my country the there's a large group of Chinese refugees who are practioners of the religion Falun Gong.
Falun Gong is kind of like, Chinese scientology.
They're kind of obnoxious.
If you ever question any of their beliefs they like to remind you that Truthfulness is a central tenet of their faith and therefore nothing they say is a lie!
On top of all their practices that appear to be Buddhist in nature.... they also believe aliens walk the Earth.
They believe that "race mixing" is just an alien ploy to help take over the Earth faster.
The founder believed that through purity one could achieve supernatural powers in the upcoming battle against the aliens (The Chinese government are some such aliens).
The founder claimed himself an ability to phase through solid objects but would never demonstrate it publicly in fear that the aliens might come after him.
My uncle gave one such “newspaper” to my dad with the instructions to “keep an open mind.” I’ve never been so proud of my dad as when he saw clear through that bullshit.
So these people are absolute and complete nutters.
But whatever.
They're in Canada now they have a right to practice their nutty religion as long as they're not hurting anyone.
