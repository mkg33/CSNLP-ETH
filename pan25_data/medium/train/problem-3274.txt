Being from FL, you probably know Gaetz dad was the FL Senate President and has allegedly gotten Matt out of trouble in the past.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
EDIT: I am being downvoted, because some people think that unless you believe something untrue, you must support the guy.
I'm simply pointing out the fact that Greenberg did ALL SORTS OF SHIT he was sentenced for, while Gaetz is accused of a subset of those activities.
So, no, Gaetz is not going to get life in prison.
Greenberg is continuing to help the Feds but I think that there is more hard work to be done by the Feds and even then... :/.
