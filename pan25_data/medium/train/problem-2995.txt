The exciting bit isn’t that a rocket got sent to space.
It’s that this is the first launch of the Artemis missions that will take people back to the Moon.
They’re real now.
Back to the Moon and beyond, this time to stay.
I’m so happy to finally see Artemis I lift off, and with over 700,000 people watching the official NASA livestream even though it was almost 2 AM ET.
In short: hell yeah!
The reason this is so exciting is because it’s the first step to an actual manned mission.
Artemis I is a test flight, Artemis II is a manned mission around the Moon, and Artemis III is a manned landing.
It boggles the mind that men walked on the moon with a level of the technology that was less advanced than a modern cell phone...

even if Moore's Law fails in the future, new methods of computing may again set the industry on breakneck development speeds".
