Yeah, where else would you invade from though?
It's an island with no neighbours but North, the only land close to it is north, major threats like China are north.
The reef would make it hard to go east by sea too I think.
I doubt anyone would bother invading Australia anyway, it's just not worth the effort.
Small population probably going to make a minor impact in wars with larger nations and fairly good allies to the north through all those islands you'd have to sail past.
Yeah, invading from the north let's you disembark, setup, use land and sea and air routes, but from the actual east coast would mean a much, much longer trip by sea, the reef causing issues and obviously would be met with heavy resistance.
South coast is just absurdly long detour to pretty much the same scenario as going north or west.
One city, and nothing else.
Australia's just pretty empty.
Size of the US but only like 7 major cities, mostly on the east coast with no major neighbours anywhere but north.
I was going to suggest sending Ukraine some cool weapons, but the fucking Aussies are ahead of me on this one, and I'm damn proud to hear it.
