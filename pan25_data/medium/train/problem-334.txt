I live in the Reddest of red areas, and can’t name you five people that I know personally within 50 miles of me that voted for Biden.
I don’t know a single person that’s against what we’re doing to help Ukraine or that doesn’t think we should be there.
In fact, most thought we should be doing more early on.
Please don’t buy what you see on Reddit or think that Tucker Carlson represents all republicans.
It’s comments like yours that are harmful, as it’s pushing a narrative that’s blatantly not true, and you probably don’t even know any better.
Surely you’re seeing other people post this same bs, and now you all believe it.
Misinformation.
Honestly.
If anyone in the world thinks the US government values spending money on its people and infrastructure over the military, I have a war to sell you.
and it is not like the money is wasted, it went to pay a lot of salaries to people.
It is actually a form of redistribution, from a billion dollar corporation to a lot of start ups and their engineers.
