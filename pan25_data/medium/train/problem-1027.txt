This is the most important part.
A lot of European countries' Transgender laws still have this stipulation, and - for example in Germany - there's a law in the making that would pay reparations to trans people that had to be chemically sterilized before being able to change their birth certificate, i.e.
name & sex.
damn, that's really fucked up... why would the laws have this in the first place?
like, surely they didn't just come out and say "we don't want trans people to have children"?
In Germany, the law came into effect after the Constitutional Court judged in favor of a transgender Woman in 1978, to be allowed to change her name.
The following law came in 1980, and was since then dragged to the Constitutional Court a handful of times for violating the German Constitution.
Back then, chemical sterilization & forced divorcement was a requirement to change your name under these laws.
Subsequently, almost all of these stipulation have been declared unconstitutional (although, sadly, only in the the year 2005 to 2011).
Probably also the stigma that being trans was a mental illness in many places, and also the era in which coercing mentally ill people to become sterilized was widespread.
