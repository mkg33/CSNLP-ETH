A) I doubt a moderate coalition is possible.
This debacle shows that Republicans are split between their establishment and the wackos who just want to troll and see everything burn.
They are being carried rightward by their extremist troll caucus.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
B) With the Republican purity tests being what they are, anyone on the Republican side who does that will be begging to be primaried in 2024.
They will be the target of every Trump Toot Social post and Hannity spot from now until then.
C) Why would Democrats trust Republicans to stick to their word?
McCarthy is where he is now exactly because he flip flopped on holding Trump accountable for Jan 6.
He isn't alone either.
Who would be a reasonable, non crazy, non Trumpy person who could be trusted to buy a Democrat a small coffee with a fiver and come back with change?
There's no reason for the dems to stop laughing at the ineptitude.
If reasonable moderate republicans exist and are tired of looking like a joke, they can come crawling to the democrats.
No reason for the democrats to come in and save republicans for themselves.
