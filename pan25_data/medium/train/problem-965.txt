Also with the current climate crisis, space may be a great way for humanity to expand with out damaging the planet more and maybe as we learn more about nature and our technology improves we can even “heal” earth, for how ever much a ball of metal, water and slime can heal.
almost every chemical we have to dig farm or whatever means of extration we need (that also damages earth) is probably floating around in space for free, now its just getting to that step of farming up there and dropping it to earth.
we have a bright future ahead (either doom clouds or clean earth) .
Lolololol so easy In all seriousness though this os crawling before baby steps, once we have a single habitat anywhere on another planet…..thats the beginning of the 3rd(4th by some count) industrial revolution.
well they did test an inflateable heatshield a few days ago a few weeks back we steered a comet now just combine those and send outself a nice comet made out of usefull stuff like silica or cobalt or whatever and just drop it somewhere in the ocean easely recoverable.
just need to find one now and build an engine on it .
