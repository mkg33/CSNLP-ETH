Prop 131 passed (added Lt. Gov), which was mainly supported by R’s although you had some D’s support it but it was championed by the likes of Kelli Ward and JD Mesnard.
Now this won’t go into effect until Hobbs is up for re-election but they did this because they thought Lake would win, and then as an incumbent likely win re-election and wanted to cover their bases for the chance she resigns, removed, etc.
Keep in mind prior to Hobbs we’ve only had 1 Dem Governor in the past 30 years who served briefly until being tapped by Obama for a cabinet spot in the 2000’s.
So they figured we will hold Gov but may not always have SOS so this way we can keep control of Gov if something goes wrong.
This was also always their fear with Ducey as Gov and Hobbs as SOS - basically meant Ducey could never retire, resign, etc mid-term.
