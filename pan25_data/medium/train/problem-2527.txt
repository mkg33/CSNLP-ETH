We’re undecided on baby 2 but we live in Texas so it would be very dangerous if I got certain complications.
I need to be a mom to my kid so can’t risk dying from some easily preventable thing because people Republicans without healthcare knowledge are making medical decisions so we’d have to move.
It’s such a paradox- the family and support system we’d need for baby 2 is in a state where I can’t have a safe as possible pregnancy so it’s lose lose.
