I remember the birth of "internet only" stations, sort of like a pirate radio reborn around 2000.
It was great.
Napster was awesome for downloads.
I still have MP3 rips of those stations where you could hear the windows error prompts or ICQ chirps pop up, as the soundcards just recorded all the audio.
Although maybe with all these data breaches, and the failure of "smart home" garbage by google and amazon, maybe people are starting to say enough.
Soon enough Im sure one of these tech companies will partner with home builders to integrate all its crap into the build so you have no choice.
I used to have a rotation of family and friends asking me to clean their computers of this crap.
I firmly believe that once they figured out how to streamline the code so that it didn't cause performance issues, that was when people stopped caring.
Used to piss me off, it all seemed so simple to me.
If something prompts you to download out of the blue, DON"T!
Noone would ever listen.
The waterfall desktops and stupid emoji's everywhere were enough of a carrot for them to sacrifice performance.
