You don't actually need to provide a canadian SIN for credit checks.
It makes it easier, and less chance of being denied though.
slightly related, it just boggles my mind how the usa provides everyone with a ss number.
We pretty much use it anytime we apply for employment, financiing, even a cell phone.
Obviously many of these organizations have it either sitting on unsecured medium (to include un shredded in dumpster.
).
It's pretty much the exact same in Canada.
Your social insurance number (same thing as the US social security number) is used any time you get a job (not as part of an application, but if you get hired, you have to provide your SIN for income tax purposes), any time you get a bank account, any time you do a credit check, any time you get financing.
And yep, plenty of scenarios where those numbers have been left unsecured, and tossed in a dumpster unshredded.
Unfortunately, we don't have the ability to lock our credit reports in Canada yet.
I recall Quebec was working on legislation though .
