I mean, it's good that it's happening - don't get me wrong.
Ukraine can use the money, the new investments and the jobs being added... but Nestle's not doing this out of any sense of sudden altruism.
It is just profits.
Invest into war torn countries for cheap land, cheap labour and cheap resources.
And Ukraine being fertile land, they have those resources on the spot.
I knew a girl who insisted that she would only drink Fiji.
Sometimes I wonder if she is still alive - seemed like the odds were against her having a very long life.
Companies aren't people they neither have friends nor interests.
Nestle is made of individuals who have friends, needs, and all the fallability of any other human being.
However under the cloak of a massive multi-national company individuals can freely exploit whatever they want with near immunity/anonymity and people will never know who they are or hold them accountable because everyone believes it was the company doing it all along and the governments of the world helped them do it.
