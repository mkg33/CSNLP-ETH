Over use and not finishing the course of antibiotics when people take them.
The resistant ones are the last to die.
People feel better and stop taking their antibiotics then the infection returns.
It's a resistant organism this time.
Then they spread that.
Another antibiotic stops working for that organism.
In commercial agricultural applications for sure (main source of developing resistance) and yes also judicious use in humans (run culture and sensitivity and tailor antibiotic therapy).
It's going to be very difficult to explain to stupid people that they shouldn't be taking antibiotics for everything or that when they do have to take antibiotics that they finish taking everything the doctor told them to take.
This is especially dangerous in countries where pharmacies sell people antibiotics without a prescription.
Bro I had a homeless dude with 2 superbugs resistant to everything except 1 IV medication just straight up leave the hospital walking with a cane.
Security couldn't find him.
He left for his ss check.
Weâ€™re fucked.
