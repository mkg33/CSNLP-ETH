Let them just go home and throw empty threats all day long.
The Russians started this conflict.
Just leave so the Ukraine people can pick up the pieces and go on with their lives.
As a US citizen I would prefer to see my taxes going to rebuilding Ukraine rather than continuing to use up bullets and bombs.
It is obvious that Russia will not be held accountable.
I am only sad that so many Ukraine citizens had to suffer the loss of loved ones over this.
How senseless this was.
Lol bro come on if Russia left what do you think is going to happen, NATO allows Ukraine to attack Russia?
They even help in some way?
Keep dreaming, the best ending for Ukraine is Russia restoring pre invasion borders but they are not going to do that.
If anything NATO will start pressuring Ukraine to make some concessions and lose some territory.
Thats the problem, they just aren't "going home" instead they are tossing out vague threats, and telling the rest of the world that Ukraine is suffering because the Russians haven't been allowed to steam roll them to end the conflict faster.
Regardless of any of the questionable points you raise, Russia is not going back to the status quo that was achieved post 1990.
Trade, sanctions and dependence on russia's natural resources are not going to revert to pre war.
The deep economic ties in Europe with Russia will not be restored.
They are at an even harsher reality than where they were during the peak of cold war.
Europe finally came to the realization that their security is affected by economic ties to a murderous clepto-authoritarian country.
I whole heartedly agree, the only possible use of Nukes at this juncture would be in a MAD situation, however I do think the words "sane" and "proportional reaction" have no business sharing a sentence with Vladimir Putin.
Yeah I kind of wonder if Elon and Putin have some kind of bet going.
Like who can be most like a Bond villain?
Or maybe just some kind of self-destructive collapse-off?
