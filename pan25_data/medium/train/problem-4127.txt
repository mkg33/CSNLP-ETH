Yes, they are celibates but preach about sexuality, they are single and preach about marital love, they are man and preach about women’s rights to abort… the list goes on and on… and I was raised a catholic but happens to be in a mixed school with fairly progresist priests and the thing that always baffled me is that you read the New Testament Jesus is preaching a very leftist socialist approach (love each other, take care of prostitutes homeless and those with ilness, etc…) but then the actual Church as an organization is a shithole… it’s sad, they are hipocrites that preach the opposite of what they’ll do, and I have no doubts that if real (I’m an agnostic now) Jesus will punish all of them for all their shittiness (not gonna happen but I can dream).
It's funny really, I'm not religious in the slightest, but the general teachings of Jesus are actually pretty spot on to be fair.
He's not a terrible role model.
The rest of it can fuck off though.
If only someone had made a list of, like, the 10 worst things you could do according to God.
I'm sure rape and/or pedophilia would be on there, right after slavery.
