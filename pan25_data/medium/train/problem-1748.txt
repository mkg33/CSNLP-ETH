If Garland appoints a special counsel, I hope they go beyond Biden and look for other documents that might be in the wind.
Not sure if it'd be their responsibility, but somebody should also figure out a better protocol for tracking these materials.
Investigate it, find out what happened and if anything got out in the open.

It's apparent that there is a problem with Presidents, Vice-President, and possibly high level cabinet members taking sensitive documents home with them and then failing to return them out of malice or negligence.
Odds are, it's because some attach√© is in charge of them and figures his/her job is done once the materials are in the hands of this prominent official.
The prominent official is so desensitized to seeing classified documents that they stop treating them with the seriousness they deserve.
