The idea is that the bill doesn’t force state to license gay marriage, but rather forces them to recognize other states’ licensure.
(Pls take this w a grain of salt I have been too lazy to look at the latest bill and this article is from a couple months ago).
This really isn’t a great bill.
The language of the bill only speaks to the federal government being required to recognize same-sex marriages IF it’s recognized by that state.
If anything this bill just gives the court more cover to overturn Obergefell, and we’ll see states outlawing it without any repercussion from this bill.
I’m very nervous to see if this bill plays out well.
