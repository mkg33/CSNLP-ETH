Lukashenko is under a lot of pressure by Putin to join the war, but he has to balance this against the risk of his own regime becoming legitimate targets.
It's not inconceivable that Ukraine could cooperate with Belarusian resistance forces to knock out enough military and governmental infrastructure with air and artillery strikes to make the Lukashenko regime vulnerable.
They could also work with their Western allies to arm Belarusian resistance forces.
Suddenly the Belarusian army and police will have to deal with a flood of weapons including small arms and more dangerous things like Javelins and NLAWs.
The West absolutely could provide these weapons to Belarusian resistance forces now, but again, unless Belarus attacks first, it would amount to an "unprovoked aggression" against Belarus.
Again, if Ukraine is seen as striking first, it would severely degrade the diplomatic standing they currently enjoy.
2: Give Belarus a final chance to reintegrate into the larger European sphere, as assisting Russia with its troops in Ukraine would be the final death knell.
Belarus as a country would simply cease to exist as far as the European Markets and Governments would see it.
