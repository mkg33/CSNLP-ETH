As a birdwatcher, the bird flu is a serious problem and could absolutely lead to another crazy pandemic.
Maybe not in humans just yet, but it's devastating bird populace globally and a huge issue that now looks to be transmissible to mammals.
That a huge, huge red flag.
We just got really lucky that the CFR is <1%.
If there's a sars or mers type 15-30% CFR pandemic, especially among working age populations, we're fucked.
On one hand, stopping a fly pandemic at the early stages has the potential to be easier than stopping covid, since covid is one of the most transmissable viruses know to humanity, something that I think many people don't appreciate fully.
On the other hand, I think broad swaths of the American public will refuse to lift a finger to help prevent any future pandemics, no matter the cost to society.
And many red states have passed legislation that essentially bans their public health departments from issuing any legally binding directives for mitigating of pandemics.
It makes sense that the process for that jump through mutation might become a little easier - we've seen the effects of Covid on the immune system, and how devastating multiple infections can be too it (seems like people are basically always sick right now, right?).
It's cycling through other populations of mammals and likely doing the same thing to their immune systems, which could lead to mutation occuring more easily in a vulnerable and weakened immune system.
