Even seemingly-impotent transnational organizations like the EU, the UN, NATO, INTERPOL, etc., represent a relief valve for massive problems that would traditionally be resolved by war.

There are limits to what people will put up with, and when words alone can't solve their problem, problems still need solving.

In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
