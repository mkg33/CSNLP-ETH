That's not really how they're using it.
It's really occuring in incremental changes where pretty much everything, except the mutations allowing it to continue infection from a mammalian host, is the same.
They're suggesting when it makes that jump it suddenly is very different and can have very different properties, which isn't really true.
Or even likely considering we're talking mammal to mammal infection so it's not even a different immune system.
For the comments, it seems nobody has read the article.
It basically says that, for the first time ever, we have observed a mammal catching bird flu from another mammal.
Until now, we only saw mammals getting it from a bird, but the virus was unable to go further.
"Well it's just the sniffles, that's all."
(heads to a big office party and drinks at the pub after).
Well, to be fair, every time the virus takes a step is by the means of a mutation.
This means that the emerging virus is a different virus.
Sure, it doesn't look good, but nobody has a clue about the virulence of a hypothetical human bird flu virus.
We'll can only know if it finally happens.
