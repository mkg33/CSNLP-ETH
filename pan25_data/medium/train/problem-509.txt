Yeah, you're probably right.
I participated in a couple of different newsgroups and some incels literally destroyed them.
I think another reason might be that ISPs stopped supporting them.
I had temporarilly cancelled my internet when I moved across town.
A month or so later, I reactivated my service.
I couldn't connect with the NNTP server so I called CS.
The guy I talked to literally did not know what I was talking about.
He claimed to not know what Usenet or an NNTP server were.
I mentioned newsgroups and he insisted that I could read news on multiple sites such as CNN.
At that point I gave up.
I just read that I can access them, but am unwilling to pay for another subscription.
The ones I have bleed me enough as it is.
Usenet access can be had for very little money.
For the curious, check out block providers who sell in GB chunks (or more) rather than subscriptions.
There are also, uh, other uses for Usenet where even paying for a subscription access would make sense for some people.
But normal Usenet, that you and I probably grew up with, is very much alive and well.
We just probably donâ€™t get access as part of our ISP bill every month.
Instead, I pay $5-$9 every few years because buying 1TB for a couple bucks lasts forever unless one is pirating massive amounts of media or something.
Just reading and engaging with groups lasts for a really long time.
What companies sell blocks of data?
I'm not into pirating these days and I'm not sure I can get anything there that I can't get from Reddit.
But I'd be willing to 'risk' a few bucks to explore.
