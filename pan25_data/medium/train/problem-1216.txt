This so so much.
In the fifa doc on netflix, one of the last things the Qatari bid leader said is 'we invite you, we want to show the world arabian hospitality.
We are a welcoming people'.
On a business level this isn't welcoming.
They knew what they were signing up for by bidding to host.
They invited the world cup knowing beer is a big sponsor.
Especially in the western world with football.
And now they want to play their 'our culture....you need to respect us' card.
Think of it logistically.
Bud will have shipped millions of beers to Qatar for this.
This impacts how much beer they can make profit on and how much may end up being written off as lost stock etc etc.
All of this matters in a working relationship.
After the dutch guy was threatened etc etc.
Its a shocking shocking look for Qatar on a business level.
Their written word means nothing at this point.
Qatar must be glad that god is so amenable to these loopholes.
If you drink or promote drinking you will suffer eternal damnation - unless it is beer from an approved promoter who only sells outside before and after games.
