A large chunk of Moldovans are outside the country, working in the EU.
A third of Moldovans have Romanian citizenship and are EU citizens.
So those 65k are probably not in the country.
They probably could, but they've ruled out military intervention in Transnistria and are sticking to that.
Perhaps once they're no longer dependent on Transnistria's gas power plant and are fully connected to Romania's grid, they'll change their mind.
I believe when it was ruled out Russia could still airlift reinforcements in since they weren't blocked from 90% of Europe's air space.
Plus their military isn't exactly equipped for such an operation.
According to Wikipedia they have 6.5k active personnel + 2k conscripts as well as 65-70k reserve personnel.
Moldova's military has a budget of $25.5 million which equals to 0.5% of their GDP.
Moldova has cut off the access of Russian replacement officers to Transnistria.
But Moldova cannot risk an all out war since they barely have an army.
Zero planes, no AA, 2 helicopters, no tanks, no artillery, no rocket artillery, infantry equipment from the soviet era.
If Russia decides to lob some cruise missiles at Moldova, they are completely defenseless.
Until recently they have been led by pro- Russian politicans who sistematically dismantled the country and tried to make it as dependent on Transnistria/Russia as possible.
