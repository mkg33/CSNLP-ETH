I've always heard this said, but I've never heard a better solution.
Getting the United States directly involved in another conflict was not going to happen, Obama enacted what sanctions the executive department could, the other sanctions were passed by Congress and by the time they reached the executive Trump was in office, sending weapons was a gamble because Ukraine was still the most corrupt nation in the EU even post revolution, and the gamble ultimately proved right because the entire Ukrainian department of justice was forced to be replaced in 2016 because they weren't prosecuting corrupt people and their businesses.
After the war in Ukraine is over, handing over these criminals could be one condition for easing the sanctions.
These guys aren't worth much of anything to Russia if on the opposite end they could get hundreds of millions of Euros worth of sanctions lifted.
I suppose that Russia will rather kill them and hand over the bodies than see them humiliated in the Hague but in any case these people will live in fear for the rest of their short lives.
To be honest I'm surprised if they haven't already been killed years ago.
