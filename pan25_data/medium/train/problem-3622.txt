I really don't understand how SCOTUS can overrule the decision to not proceed with another president's policy.
I've never heard of something like this.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Especially considering the whole basis of the policy is the theory that Covid would be brought into the U.S, which should have ended when travel restrictions ended.
This seems like the ultimate overstepping of authority (even if there are other rulings that have been more damaging).
It's because this court (the current conservative majority) are not ruling base on any precedent but on whatever whims they think will help their conservative agenda.
That and they will never allow Biden to have an easy win and only bend to allow Republican presidents' wills/whims.
Title 42 wasn't just for the pandemic.
But specifically to keep Covid out because they claimed a bunch of dirty immigrants were infecting everybody.
SCOTUS actually has more reason to say it's no longer necessary, even if they think it was necessary to begin with.
This just seems like a far, far bigger overreach than any other ruling.
Like they're holding a previous, defunct, administrative policy to the same authority as a law passed by congress.
It just seems to have passed under the radar because the subject is less impactful to most Americans than something like abortion.
