This is quite amazing.
For nature and humans of the region alike!
With global warming and population increase, water salination tech will be essential for this region.
I'm also glad to see drought damages being reversed and good neighbourly cooperation 🌍🕊️👑☝️.
Imagine if other people surrounding Israel were more peaceful… there already was peace with Jordan, Egypt, UAE, why couldn’t there be with others around there.
Yeah Israel can continue destroying gravesites of Palestinians and taking their homes Expand the settlements, who knew that things could be so great if we just surrender and accept whatever my neighbor determines is peace.
What a wonderful world!
Takes a lot of energy to desalinate.
If you can indeed supply the energy from renewable sources, this is a good thing.
But at present, Israel, who discovered large amounts of gas in the last decade, is likely relying on fossil fuels to enable it.
Again, fine if you can capture the CO2, but there is not a proven-to-scale method to do this, just yet.
