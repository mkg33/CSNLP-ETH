It's unnecessary.

It really is an amazing thing, Don't have to worry about carrying cash at all in Delhi.
Can pay online for even a single chewing gum of 1 Rs.
And it's free to use as well.
I don't know much about UPI, but is it not different from Credit cards?
Its more like a debit card, no?
Currently UPI is primarily based on Debit card/Bank account.
But UPI with Rupay (Rupay is similar to Visa/MC) credit cards for select banks is live.
So you can link your credit card to UPI and scan qr codes to pay just like in UPI.
But the catch is only merchant transactions are allowed unlike UPI with bank account so you can't send money to your friend via UPI credit card.
Also since only Rupay Credit Cards are allowed and that too only for select bank accounts it's really still in a beta phase.
Also UPI itself still has issues to solve as its pretty bad anti fraud system and chargebacks are close to impossible in UPI.
So if you get scammed you most likely aren't going to see that money again compared to credit cards where you can just raise a chargeback.
