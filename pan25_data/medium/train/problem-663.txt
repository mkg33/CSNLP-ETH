Why is that?
You can deliver these pesticides in a far more Precision manner if you just make better sprayers and then you're just not spraying anywhere near as much pesticide to get the same effect.
The EU plans to reduce hazardous petisicides that use chemicals linked to causing cancer as well as banning petisicide use in environmentally vulnerable areas.
So is this a volume reduction or is this more of a stop using extremely toxic and dangerous ones and start using safer ones.
Do it now with any type of pesticide just by making sprayers that spray the pesticide directly on the plant instead of the entire field.
Doing it that way has been predicted to reduce pesticide use by 80 to 90%, so there's probably a reasonable path forward like that.
Depending on what percentage of farmers are still dependent on these agricultural practices, that would lead to mass famine.
Even 80% might still do so.
It takes possibly multiple growing seasons, additional costs, and a pretty significant amount of education to convert from conventional agriculture to more organic methods.
Productivity likely goes down at first as well, as a farmer practices and gets better at those growing methods.
So I guess the takeaway is that an increase in demand for agricultural exports will slightly help Brazil and Argentina's otherwise dysfunctional economies and benefit Russia in the long term.
It will also probably slightly change the diet of Europeans since processed food made from cheaper imported ingredients will displace expensive protected artisanal foods for the mainstream population.
