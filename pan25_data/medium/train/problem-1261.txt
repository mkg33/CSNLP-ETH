All of this would indicate that Hutchinson was not being treated like a client, she was instructed to lie and obfuscate to protect his real clients - the gop figure heads who were footing her bill.
Hutchinson was also instructed that she didn't need to say what she heard in the meetings she was in.

Yup, there was.
Her lawyer was being paid by trump and when Hutchinson asked her lawyer to disclose who was funding her legal bill, as he's required to do, he refused to say.
He was telling her to not download calenders and stuff so she could say "I don't recall" but a lawyer would have just asked her "do you have any materials that would inform you" she'd be legally required to say yes, she has a calendar.
I’ve run into that on a small scale I worked for a small company gobbled up by a large one and a lawyer working for the company gave us advice and basically said we couldn’t work anywhere else that in any way could possibly compete with the new company(for example it was so broad I couldn’t quit and start my own business and sell candy bars to their customers)We asked for our own lawyer surprise they didn’t want to do that.
I had a friend who is a lawyer and they said the contract was worthless because it contradicted federal law.
They can only enforce direct non compete not prevent you from making a living by selling their clients things unrelated to what the business did.
