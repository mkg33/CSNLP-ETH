An honest question: Why would they're government care about them doing a hunger strike?
Nobody is forcing them to do this and hunger strikes come off no better than a child holding their breath to get their way.
The difference is the parent actually cares about the childs wellbeing enough to stop them.
Your mother will stop you from holding your breath because she cares for you.
The government will not stop you from hunger striking because they do not care about you.
If they do not care about your well-being in any way then why would they think that hunger striking would cause a change in thought?
What are you on about?
Egypt is a corrupt dictatorship that routinely jails tens of thousands of political prisoners.
They're not doing this because the government gives a shit about them, they're doing it because the government probably gives a shit about an international reaction to journalists dying in Egyptian prisons.
100% the government doesn't care about them dying, but those people have some little hope the international community might shine a light to what's happening to them.
Don't know if anything might happen out of this, but these people don't have a lot of options.
Anything is probably better than being held in prisons here in Egypt.
Our prisoners get treated worse than street animals.
