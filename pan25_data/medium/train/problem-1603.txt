Here's a pretty good thread on the court docs on Twitter, I think the moment that still stands out to me is Tucker calling for one fo their network reporters to be fired because her fact-checking of Trump's Dominion tweets was 'hurting the company" with this line: "the stock price is down."
Pretty much says it all.
It all begins and ends with Rupert Murdoch.
I don't think he even has much concern whether he's a great influence with Republicans or Democrats as he has a desire to have influence.
I mean at least his first influential ties with where with the New York Mayor Koch going back to the late seventies early eighties.
it's time to stop pretending that republicans are an actual political party and acknowledge them for who they are; a bunch of grifters taking advantage of an ignorant population.
However the very reason he was able to get Fox was because he had ties with Reagan and he required a special exemption from the government to do so.
Rupert Murdoch has no principles and you can thank his daddy for that.
He was groomed to be what he was just like Trump.
Although unlike Trump Rupert Murdoch is a successful businessman.
Not ethical by any means but successful.
Yeah, I’ve always kind of wondered what exactly he was doing in Britain.
That’s interesting do you mind sharing a bit in regards to how the laws there make it better?
