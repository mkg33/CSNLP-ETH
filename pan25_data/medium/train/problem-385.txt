Heâ€™s not wrong, but at the same time India must live with aligning themselves with Russia on this issue against basically the entire rest of the world.
Woah hold your horses NATO and EU is not entire world there are 192 countries on earth you realise that ?
Why all the support to Ukraine and non to Armenia ?
?
Do you even know about the war going on between these countries ?
As an Indian i can say it depends..nobody knows where the world gonna go as it entered in another geopolitical mayhem of power politics.. definitely Russia gonna be damaged for a long time however loosing Russia as an ally in Asia..what other major workable power exist in Asia?
A sanctioned Iran, China?...lemme remind you Russian and china effectively has leverage over the enitere Central Asia and Chinese still enjoy an upper hand in Asian countries..
If they want to use Russia solely as a cheap fuel station then probably not much.
If they want to rely on russian military assistance like they did in the past then good luck.
