im not willing to sell out my friends that they constantly attack so they can just magically "save the country" whatever the fuck that even means!?
they are too far out of step with the rest of us and the world.
they were the ones who tried to overthrow our democracy violently not the other way around.
im not compromising on becoming breeding stock, im not compromising my freedom of religion and freedom from religion.
they can fuck right off.
