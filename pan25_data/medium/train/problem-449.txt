Religion is a practice in insanity.
Mixing it with power is a macabre nightmare.
And we live on a planet where people never stop doing it.
Don't come at with us with that "it's not religion" bullshit.
Religion has been the reason for millions and millions of horrific murders and countless more oppression to billions.
So yeah, sometimes, we sane people need to look around at each other and fucking empathize with each other about the nightmare that is living in a cult planet.
If you don't like that, tough shit.
We at least deserve to relate to one another while living through this horrible chapter of history.
I can only hope humanity somehow moves past the dark ages where such ridiculous nonsense causes such heinous trouble.
I could go on and on and on, but the truth is that Muslims who don't act this barbaric way are the ones Muhammad would have killed.
Um, it actually does, mate.
It represents the barbarian pedophile Muhammad's vision for an Arab Abrahamic Revelation quite accurately.
Fortunately, the nations of Islam will return to the third world where their ignorant superstitious nonsense has kept them since the pedophine barbarian Muhammad lied about an imaginary god to the ignorant, gullible, and cowardly.
“My grandfather rode a camel, my father rode a camel, I drive a Mercedes, my son drives a Land Rover, his son will drive a Land Rover, but his son will ride a camel.”.
When the oil runs out, so will the modern world's need to placate the savages, barbarian kings, and theocrazies of Islam.
They can then go back to just killing themselves as they have for over 1,400 years...for no reason at all.
سوء الحظ أن الإسلام سوف يسيطر على العالم.
الحمد لله.
لطالما تعرض العالم الإسلامي للتهديد من قبل المتوحشين.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided.
It won't do anything to have an attorney, but it might give us an excuse to arrest another one.
