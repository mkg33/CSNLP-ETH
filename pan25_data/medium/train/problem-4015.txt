I heard the former CEO on NPR pointing out that the artist decides whether or not to use Dynamic Pricing and honestly I don’t really see a problem with the artists choosing to do so.
Theoretically the big fans can get cheaper ticket by buying sooner.
The actual problem is that Ticketmaster actively enables scalpers to buy up a bunch of tickets first.
They guy was making it sound like it was Taylor Swift’s choice to sell tickets for thousands of dollars, but no Swift capped the ticket price at $499 (although I don’t know how transparent they are that the actual price to fans will be higher after fees nor whether the fees are also dynamic).
The problem I see is how many people had to buy scalped tickets for way more.
