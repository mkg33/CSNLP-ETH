That said, it does NOT guarantee the rights of people in conservative states to get married should Obgerfell get overturned :
I can't wait for the vote to take place, it'll be nice to not have to worry on behalf of so many people that I know and care about.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
FYI, sadly we still have Prop 8 on the books.
California courts, county clerks, etc.
are not enforcing it due to Obergefell v. Hodges, which supersedes a state constitution.
I believe there is a petition drive to get a ballot prop to repeal Prop 8 just in case.
I want to be clear that this sucks balls, but right now, with the votes we have, our options are "don't protect ourselves at all" and "at least make sure that our marriages remain acknowledged once SCOTUS does what we all know they're going to do".
We're going to have to keep fighting, but I think it would be stupid and shortsighted to not at least take the opportunity we have right now to set ourselves up to fight from a position of power.
It's a hell of a lot easier to fight, to organize, and to remain politically active when you aren't trying to figure out how to survive because you suddenly don't have insurance or are having to go to court to establish rights to your kids or to make decisions for a sick partner, or suddenly might not even be a legal US citizen anymore.
