Trump is already not going to be sympathetic to the argument that he's harming the GOP and should step aside for their benefit.
At all.
So they won't get anywhere with that kind of approach.
The only thing that might get through to him is to convince him that he will suffer an even more humiliating electoral defeat, and that his base won't buy the stolen election rhetoric again.
That's going to be a tough sell, since his ego will make it hard for him to accept that he can't win and everyone will know that he was too afraid to try.
And he knows that as of right now his base are still parroting the stolen election claims, so as long as they'll still believe that he may think he has nothing to lose.
Republican thought leaders might try to un-ring that bell and stop spreading the big lie, but there's probably not enough time to turn things around before Trump makes his decision.
In general, be courteous to others.
