They couldn’t be more obvious about their inferiority complex, and it’s manifested in the worst possible way.
Hey, sometimes it is the Mongol's fault that Russia is so bad due to the mongol yoke and not just an excuse to blame someone other than Russia fof russia's issues.
Why on earth would you make this about the Russian "national character"?
All regimes through history justify their conquest and imperialism with the language of defense and victimization.
This is just propaganda 101.
Portraying millions of Russians as fundamentally having inferiority complexes is lazy stereotyping.
Blame Putin, his regime, and their actions, not the "Russian national character" for Ukraine.
Do you think the enlightenment reached Russia ?
I don’t think it did, and they know it.
It is literally a country many decades behind the west in practically every measurable metric of progress, and they know it.
There is something wrong with Russia , something that has prevented it from improving in the way that empires have over the past century ( France , Germany , England for example, who committed appalling crimes/genocide against smaller nations, but who have largely faced this reality and grown better from them.
This process isn’t complete, England still doesn’t really acknowledge or face up to honestly what it did to Ireland for instance, but they are better than they used to be).
