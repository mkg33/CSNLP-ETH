In essence, the population has been largely non-religious for decades, but a lot of people identify as “Christian” for cultural rather than actual religious reasons.
The number of people who self identify as belonging to the Church of England who actually go to Church is less than 10%.
The main change is that people who lead non-religious lives are now being more honest about it.
None sarcasm aside this is probably it.
A lot of friends who used to hide behind Christian are now openly pagen or one of billion ways people call those who follow the Nordic gods.
I only really starting admitting it after work went to great lenhs to show it would be a good thing and celebrated by them and i would not be treated like some looney lol.
(Got to thank Iceland the country for that one to be honest as that was example work used to show I would be ok lol).
I suspect it is the same in the US.
Most obvious in the cities but from what I hear from coworkers who live in rural areas, there is little to no social life/acceptances without being a Christian, though it is changing for the better in more recent years.
