Yeah you really have to wonder what their endgame is here.
All they’ve gotten is negative press, if they just didn’t host it then most would probably never realize its this bad down there.
Their endgame is simple: promote their nation as a "new Singapore" for engineers, and a place to do business and financial operations.
They know that oil is finite and consumption is bound to go down in years to come, and need to recreate their economic core.
Except that they got all wrong: no amount of shiny buildings can really get over their regressive, backward, culture and government system.
Anyone qualified and experienced with a 6 to 7 digits income would choose places like Netherlands over Qatar any day and time.
Even Chile and Uruguay or some Brazilians states are more competitive in that regard.
These folks wants shill and life quality, night life and freedom, not a glass box with offices inside.
And their own citizens (native ones) simple can't hope for to carry on their nation with their current income levels in a service economy.
Thus, they are not competitive enough to attract this kind of ultra qualified and specialized professionals that they hope for to live there.
