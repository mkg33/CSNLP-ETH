Same.
I want the GOP camps split as close to 50/50 as possible to minimize their chances in 2024.
As happy as I am to see conservatives turning on Trump, it's going so fast that I'm worried they'll all be united in support of DeSantis in a couple months, giving him two years to solidify is base.

I'm hoping Trump's inevitable meltdown occurs closer to November 2024 and he really starts taking shots at their party, beyond stupid name-calling and empty threats.
He's likely to announce he's running again, which most of the Republicans don't want.
It's unlikely that he'll endorse someone to run, especially not DeSantis.
