It's kind of disingenuous to compare an intelligence failure from 2003 that was the result of Neocon groupthink within that US (Bush) administration that the US has admitted was an intel failure and to use it to paint all US intel going forward as unreliable.
Well that, and if the Russian Federation crumbles, there's a massive land mass of potential new countries, many with nukes, each unpredictable and potentially power hungry.
It would be like having a neighbor who smokes too much pot and occasionally gets in paranoid arguments with anyone who will listen, only for them to have a heart attack, and immediately gangsters move in every house on your block.
US intel also said Russia was planning to invade Ukraine when even the Ukrainians didn't actually believe it (and much of the world) because it was so far outside of the international norms for Russia to do such a thing, the conventional thinking was from everyone else was "no way" or "that's too crazy it won't happen" yet the US intelligence community was like "yeah but you don't just move all those troops and resources not to use them".
