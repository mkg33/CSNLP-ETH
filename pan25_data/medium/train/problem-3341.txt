It's about holding the debt ceiling hostage to get the budget cuts they want in the next budget.
The debt ceiling gets hit in July-ish, with no option other that default remaining in September.
The current budget runs through September, and all essential functions continue to operate past then.
They are hoping the threat of a US default and subsequent economic turmoil (massive inflation, massive devaluation of the dollar, mass unemployment, servere depression) will allow them to make their long desired cuts to SS, medicare, and medicaid.
They only do this when a Democrat holds the Presidency, because they know cutting entitlements is incredibly politically damaging and they know through their propoganda networks they can blame it on Biden.
Nobody fears a shutdown.
Everyone should be terrified of a default.
