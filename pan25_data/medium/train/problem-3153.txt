Ok but aren’t the minks in cages?
How did they eat wild birds while they are enclosed and the openings look way too small to fit a bird through?
Literal passage from the article: “Recently, an HPAI H5N1 infection was detected at a mink farm in Spain, where there was possible spread of the virus between the animals.”.
Millions died from COVID which was mild compared to other viruses it could've been dealt with in 2 months if China and the US wasn't so obsessed with capitalism.
I just hope one of these days one of these COVID variations doesn't kill 5% of the planet.
One thing I do know is that if it does happen 10% of Florida will die.
90% of those 10 % will be conservatives.
Its a pride thing at this point.
They refuse to use any type of foreign vaccine despite how OBVIOUSLY superior they are to their own, to the point millions are unnecessarily dying, and they don’t want anyone to know that their homegrown vaccines and lockdowns aren’t working.
This now simply requires them humbling themselves and asking for help, which I personally don’t believe will ever happen.
People who are homeless, can't afford masks (FFS medical companies are marking up and forcing scarcity on.
To literal masks), and people In the global South would die too.
