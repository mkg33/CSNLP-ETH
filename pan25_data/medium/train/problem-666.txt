I was a registered Republican for 20 years, figuring that way I could at least vote for the least extreme of their candidates ( or vote for the most exteme, unelectable of the bunch, which I did one year when I cast my ballot for Bachman).
I think it would be an excellent strategy for all of us to embark on, and could actually make a difference if enough people went along.
But no matter how many times I explained to my friends and family, no one got it.
My gf was so embarrassed seeing a an R next to my name when we’d go to vote that I finally had to switch to independent to appease her.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
I’m glad to see at least one other person in the world tried that strategy, and at least 5 others thought was a good strategy based on upvoted.
My point being, if there was an organized movement to rework the Republican Party by joining it to vote in primaries or field our candidates that want to put an R next to their name in elections even if they’re not actually trying to further that platform, I would eagerly do all I can to help.
Amazing that Republicans vote for criminals.
Are they just naive, or do they think they make great leaders?
Why not just hire the mafia to run the country?
