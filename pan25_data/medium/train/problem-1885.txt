The air ones I don't think we'll ever get a concrete update because air drones are more valuable and the more secretive they are, the better they work.
We're still not sure what happened to the Russian airbase.
I was surprised that the drones actually are very important, guided weapons cant do much if dont have a good target, and the drones with cameras can find them.
And drones are cheaper as well.
It can move around if need be and can be unpredictable.
That's why the sea drone Ukraine sent last month did damage.
It evaded Russia helicopters attacks and crash near a ship.
Ukraine had stated months back that they were developing drones capable of very long range attacks.
Can't believe the war has dragged on for so long to the point that they reached experimental stage.
10 months is long time if you are serious about the development and scrap the red tape.
Look at the tank development in WW2.
The war was started with PZ.III and ended Tiger II and Elefant TD.
Its basically incomparable and it happened over 4 years.
US developed nuke in that time.
