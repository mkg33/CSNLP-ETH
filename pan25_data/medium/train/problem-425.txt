Well, not true at all.
Finland just had ungodly great diplomatic plays during Cold War, that maintained relations between west and east, and even build the bridge between them and created the fundamental for Europe security.
It was not a coincidence that Helsinki accord was done in you know Helsinki.
Do they get VAT refund if the use the missiles outside their borders?
And is a missile considered to be consumed where it’s fired from or where it lands?
They actually get VAT refund for purchasing them.
But that amount is equal to what the seller must pay.
Finns have always been in a precarious position with border right next Russia.
Spending money on defense is not cheap but necessary.
You hope you never have to use it but be prepare.
Of course, but guns and shells were not the reason Finland did so well during the Cold War years.
It is quite the opposite of your claim, Finland did great because itself realize to stay within influence of both west and east, it’s not that Soviet did not want to “liberate Finland from west”, but diplomatically Soviet thought it already done so and Finland was well within its influence.
Finland always maintained a very credible and strong defense force, but it was always viewed as deterrent and not something of a level that could crush Soviet or Russia war machines.
Secondly, this is war, unbelievable for me to say this, but war is serious, you can play diplomatic neutrality, but how far will you take stand?
No way Finland out of all the nations will stay still while another Europe nation is under attack.
