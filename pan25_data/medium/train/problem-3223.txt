I’m going to guess the major GOP donors get involved to prevent [further] disaster on the right (probably threaten being primaried or if applicable, funding a recall), … but it would be devilish fun if the Democrats helped elect a speaker alongside moderate Republicans.
He or she wouldn't need a majority vote from the Republicans, but a majority vote from the Democrats with a handful of moderate Republicans willing to go against their whip.
This is what happened in the Ohio House of Representatives a few years ago - though, said Speaker ended up being arrested, impeached, and removed for bribery not long afterward.
Oops.
