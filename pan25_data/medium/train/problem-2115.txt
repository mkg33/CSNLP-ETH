Naturally, Fuckwork Orange responds to Paul Ryan with the thoughtful, measured eloquence for which he's renowned:
>“Paul Ryan is a loser, Mitt Romney could have won without him.
I won twice, did much better the second time, and was 233 Wins out of 253 Races in the Midterms.
Paul Ryan is destroying Fox, and couldn’t get elected dogcatcher in the Republican Party!” Trump said in a Sunday post.
If Desantis is the 2024 nominee you can bet your ass this sub will be upvoting post saying that Desantis is actually worse/more dangerous than Trump.
It’s not about Trump.
It’s not about Desantis.
It’s not about Ryan.
It’s about demonizing the political opposition whoever that may be.
No sanity will return to the Republican Party, only worse shit.
The best we can hope for is the base shrinking out of existence in a few generations and the current democrat party becoming the right wing.
I feel like a rejection of Trumpism will not happen, even long after he is gone.
It is an ideology that thrives on reactionary takes and social media revenue is based in extremism driving as views.
