As a reader of history, I cannot tell you how common it was before govt regulation became a 'thing' in this country to see stories of 'adulterated milk' - like many grocers had a regular practice of lacing cheap MILK with all sorts of shit like plaster dust to extend their stock to more bottles.
The obvious fact that a lot of the milk drinkers were children was an understandable source of concern.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Very sadly the profit motive drives a lot of otherwise 'good' people to do very bad things ('for the sake of MY children is a common pretext) - in other words, honest govt regulation is vital for the nation's health and well being.
