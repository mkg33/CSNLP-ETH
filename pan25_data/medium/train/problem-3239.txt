Of hardwoods for sure!
It'd be nice if a similar pressure emerges to protect our boreal forests one day too (and help countries like Canada/Scandinavia bolster softwood prices too etc).
Issue is Canada already has far cheaper stumpage than say the US or other countries that sold off most of their lands to private holders.
Canada would be reluctant to reduce supply because they are known for their cheaper softwood.
Canada's softwood lumber prices will basically never be bolstered; we cut the worst deal with the US, which guarantees a poor outcome for Canadian softwood lumber.
In the past few years, Canadian timber company's have been buying Southern Yellow Pine forest tracts and mills in Georgia.
So they may have found a way to get even.
Good for them.
I think that's smart.
Limit tree cutting to what is sustainable and collude to drive up price.
Win win for the planet and their economies.
Between these three countries we cover the vast VAST majority of the world's tropical rainforests.
This is positive.
So interesting to see them working together and identify with each other over their a) resource that historically was hard to avoid plundering, but b) the rich biodiversity and more that also makes these forests an incredibly important asset for the whole planet.
By taking on a stewardship role, these three countries could boost their influence internationally in many areas of science, conservation, medicine, indigenous relations and more (issues all three countries have struggled with, but could one day contribute to advancing).
