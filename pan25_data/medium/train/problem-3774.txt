Yesterday there was a nation wide rally to support the “INE” which is the National Electoral Institute, which oversees elections and guarantees democracy in Mexico.
Current president Lopez Obrador, wants to basically eliminate said Institute in favour of a body which he can control, effectively going back to the PRI which ruled Mexico for over 70 years.
Current ruling political party, MORENA, has been trying to deviate attention from this event by organizing a free baseball match on the spot where most rallies usually happen, by turning on floor fountains to get people wet, by calling an ambient contingency in Mexico City, which stops cars from circulating in the city, thus making it difficult to attend.
Still, independent sources claim an attendance of over 500,000 people just in Mexico City, with many more thousands attending in over 20 cities.
While current government claims attendance of just 10-12 thousand people.
“Fernando Belaunzarán, one of the promoters of the protest, said 200,000 people participated in the march.
Authorities did not confirm this figure.”.
