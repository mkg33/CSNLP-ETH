I don't see Finland saying no (nor "we'll just join with Sweden later") to joining if ratified, but the constantly growing amount of hoop jumping demanded for possible ratification has become too mutch even for finnish politicans.
With an open front in Ukraine, they could never afford an other one with finland, even alone.
The terrain is on Finland side, and the whole logistic to bring an army to Finland doorstep could be disrupted very easily.
There's no guarantee that Erdogan won't just make up a new obstacle Finland has to overcome if they tried that.
Finland as a nation would rather not be swept up in the political election games for some wannabe dictator and be forced to make unnecessary sacrifices.
Best to cut the political bullcrap and just wait until after Turkey has had their elections.
Finland is in the EU and more importantly uses the Euro, if they were attacked every country using the euro has to either join the war to save their economy or change their currency and basically destroy a big part of the EU from within.
And if the EU is at war NATO will be in some way too.
It would be an even bigger blow to all the values Finland holds dear if they bended to Turkey now and abandoned Sweden.
That will only happen if they are 100% certain Turkey will never let Sweden in.
It's still election season in Turkey, I can almost guarantee that Erdogan would milk that situation for all it's worth and would make impossible demands from Finland as well.
The fact that Erdo said that he wouldn't means less than nothing.
It's just not worth it.
Both Finland and Sweden can afford to wait until July and let cooler heads prevail.
