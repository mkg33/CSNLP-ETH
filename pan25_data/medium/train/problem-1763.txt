the west will decline to punish russia over it because it will be an escalation.
But nato will move air defense to "protect" Polands border.
(IE act as a buffer zone preventing another accident).
The real decisions are always made in the hallway, or in the coffee kitchen.
You call people into the conference room to communicate the decisions, not to make them.
That's usually because the meetings are not important and they're stuff that could have been replaced by an email.
Meeting are for wasting time while feeling like you're doing something.
Talk about the last meeting, how nothing has been done and plan the next one.
Meetings are for the sake of just having a meeting.
Management would have a meeting every day at 9AM on the dot.
Talk about the machine data and why performance was down which was tracked by our software.
Thats it.
No plans on how to fix problems, no input from machine crews or feedback to those crews.
The current hope is that Poland doesn't jump the gun and do eye for an eye.
Which will drag all of nato into war with russia.
Which will have the secondary benefit of making the far western parts of Ukraine be shielded by Nato air defense systems.
