What is it like there?
How are they cleaning it?
Is farmland impacted?
I grew up in NE Kansas and so this story is on my mind, but I canâ€™t find much about it beyond the number of gallons leaked.
No clue just yet.
I want to go see the impact but I haven't had to time since I work all the time and to my knowledge it's blocked off ðŸ˜• I'll ask around and keep an update.
Huge clean up effort though , that they are trying to keep under wraps.
Farmland, underground water reservoirs are being affected though also the water.
They just won't come out and say anything.
First off we can just discount ship for north america.
If you are planning on canadian sand oil then ship from BC-Houston-wherever is fucking stupid, may as well build refineries in BC.
We need tighter regulations and to make them account for inevitable leaks, maybe a sleeve around the pipe or a drip pan running the lenh of it.
And every yard of pipe should be monitored so they can catch leaks when they start.
But mainly train because it is multi-purpose (similar to truck...nothing like pipe) and because as we decrease our addiction to oil the cost of putting in train lines will not be lost.
The article i posted states that the 'best' idea is to build bigger, new pipelines.
But it also presupposes in the opening paragraph that "Oil is going to keep moving, in increasing volumes due to our new energy boom" (granted this was written in 2018).
New generations are not as horny for oil or combustion as previous ones.
People running shit in 2050 are not going to be as gaga for oil as the modern crop of geriatric addicts.
