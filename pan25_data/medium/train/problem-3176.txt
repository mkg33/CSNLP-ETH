AI is a powerful tool not just for bad party's but for everyone.
Part of the reason I believe we're seeing all this upheaval is because the mechanisms of old are desperately trying to cling onto a dying age, and things like the internet and AI will only continue to democratize information and labor.
People think things like AI will make us easier to exploit, but quite the contrary.
It'll make it harder to exploit us, things like UBI's and regulations will become a necessity, even for the wealthy who's invested in the old, they'll have to adapt to survive.
AI was once used by the Imperium of Man, but there was a cybernetic revolt where they turned on humans.
Machine spirits are a bit more complicated.
They're basically what actually makes any piece of technology work or not, in the eyes of humans.
There are some stronger machine spirits than others.
Some of the stronger ones are able to function completely automatically and even able to directly communicate with psykers and through technological means with those part of the mechanicus.
