The war of opportunity was Iraq.
Afghanistan in the 90s and early 00s was a well documented, well known, legitimate state sponsor of terrorism.
Al-Qaeda operated openly in Afghanistan with the Taliban's blessing.
When Saudi Arabia stripped bin Laden of his citizenship and left him stateless, the Taliban welcomed him and gave him Afghan citizenship.
The leader of the Taliban met and discussed suitable targets for al-Qaeda to attack internationally.
After 9/11, the US demanded bin Laden's extradition and for the state government of Afghanistan to close al-Qaeda's bases and training camps, both of which were refused.
States are not allowed to aid and abet paramilitaries on their soil to attack foreign states.
If Putin as head of state met with Wagner to discuss attacks on foreign soil and then Wagner blew up a train in Germany, will you not hold the state of Russia responsible?
Something I've only appreciated more recently is how much members of the Taliban are such fucking losers.
I saw a video of them finding a couple of bottles of wine and a bit of vodka in a house and denouncing the (former, escaped) occupants as denegerate sex-obsessed perverts.
Like fucking hell that's barely a decent teenage drink in a park on a quiet weekend.
