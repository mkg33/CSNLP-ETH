It's crazy that the US can use and supply Abrams in Iraq, and now argue the logistics would be impossible in this European war.
Their solution is that neighbouring countries, like Poland should.
Shouldn't they encourage Poland to buy more Leos in that case?
Do they have another reason?
It can't be money since they donate a lot of equipment like the HIMARS and Bradleys etc.
Exactly and potentially starting a nuclear war is just well shortsighted at best, I mean don’t get me wrong war is terrible but when something like ww3 looms over, it’s a tough call to make.
Always stand up to bullies, because eventually you’re going to be in a fight with them whether you want to be or not.
Yeah, I mean I’m pro Ukraine in this conflict, but this is just a way to keep the military industrial complex pumping.
It’s proven to be a very effective way to put tax dollars in the hands of rich assholes for 100 years now!
It’s an easy decision to make, imho.
It’s just one of those choices that unfortunately comes with risk.
However, it’s still an easy choice because if we choose to back down every time someone rattles their nuclear sabre then they will certainly rattle it again and again , and eventually we will come to the same point of having to finally take a stand.
The only difference is we will have already lost a shitload before growing a backbone.
