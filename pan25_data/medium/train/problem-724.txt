Most of the Russian positions in the Donbas are stabilized and defensive.
They've committed to taking Bakhmut as a point of pride/arrogance/honor, and have been attacking the city nonstop for months.
For some strange reason they keep supplying materiel and troops to this specific offensive, and they've turned it into a WW1 Verdun style trench slaughter of their own troops.
So yes, they've been doing this for months, and Ukraine keeps hanging on to the ruins of the city.
It's important to note that the Russians compare it to Verdun, and liken their own tactics to those of the Germans.
It's like they've forgotten how much of a disaster Verdun was for the Germans.
Ah, but the point was to inflict disproportionate casualties.
A 10% gap wasn't enough, despite people claiming success they were intending a 2 or 3 to 1 ratio.
Moreover, bleeding the French at Verdun didn't achieve any of the larger aims of the Germans.
The amount of resources expended in the offensive was obscene compared to what they actually got out of it.
And in the case of Bakhmut the Russians are suffering much higher attrition than their adversaries.
So, while the Germans at Verdun arguably achieved something of dubious value the same really can't be said about the Russians today.
