The has confirmed that Russian and Russian-backed forces have committed grave and widespread war crimes in Ukraine.
The Commission found mass graves, with corpses showing “visible signs of executions on bodies, such as hands tied behind backs, gunshot wounds to the head, and slit throats”.
It also attested to indiscriminate use of artillery and explosives by Russian forces “without distinguishing between civilians and combatants in populated areas”.
“Children have become the victims of the full spectrum of violations investigated by the Commission, including indiscriminate attacks, torture, and rape”.
With the truth of these war crimes now a matter of public record, is there any prospect that the perpetrators will be brought to justice?
Russia – along with China, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States – is able to wield a permanent veto at the UN Security Council to thwart any resolution it wishes.
In addition, Russia – as with China and the United States – is not a signatory to the International Criminal Court, and denies the court’s jurisdiction over its citizens.

When will this war end?
It is so sad and devastating.
World is suffering.
More the drag, weaker both these countries become.
They both will be wasteland.
No possibility of even restitution, as there will be nothing to provide restitution for.
