I don't give a shit about the GOP's talking points du jour, and I won't be wasting my time arguing within the narrow framework/narrative that conservatives already set for the public.
And that's why I'm done debating with most folks.
It's not a debate when one side will say whatever is necessary to "win.
".
I'm done arguing with them.
Now, I'm organizing with others and putting in the work to crush the GOP electorally.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
That's what I've realized over the last 15 years.
They were frustrating under Bush, and the Tea Partiers were maga-lite, but everything after 2016 is pure intentional ignorance or provocateur.
They know what they are and what they're doing, even if they "don't watch the news" as so many of the older GOP voters like to say.
Of course reality is they're watching Fox or OAN every chance they get.
And they absolutely believe it, but make zero effort to do a thought experiment to consider the real consequences of those beliefs.
