There's over 5000 collapsed residential buildings, so even best case scenario, if we say on average each building had only 50 residents at the time of the quake (4am) and 50% magically survive a complete collapse , well that's still 120000 dead.
This is not going to be good at all.......
This is just the initial toll.
Still places without help.
It is soon going to be geared towards recovery missions rather than rescue, sad to say.
It sounds like some cities haven't yet seen meaningful response from emergency crews.
Also, there is hesitation to dispatch military personnel for some reason.
I hate to say it, but the final toll could easily be 10x this 5,000 figure.
The reluctance to deploy the military is obvious.
So far erdogan has only deployed search and rescue to cities that voted for him.
Those that didn't haven't received as much as a phone call.
Again Erdogan hasn't called for the military because he doesn't want the military to get any popular support.
He wants his AFAD to be the only ones in the spotlight.
