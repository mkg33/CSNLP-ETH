Greed is part, but the core of the curse is that a few people can control the resources and their extraction.
The few on top are then no longer beholden to the approval or disapproval of the majority.
The quality of life of the majority in extraction nations is irrelevant to production of resources and leaders don't rely on most of them to produce anything of value.
Rulers of these extraction nations pay off a small circle of countrymen/ tribespeople/ oligarchs to be their fanatical protectors and then import security, workers, and tech from elsewhere with the money they are making hand-over-fist if they need more.
Being terrorists has never stopped the West from buying oil from countries in the past, unfortunately geopolitically it has worked out that most of the oil comes from terrorist states and everyone needs to stay warm and producing power.
Renewable/alternative energy forms are a national security risk, pushing towards these instead of Petro is going to insulate the US and other countries from oil cartels and terrorist Petro states.
