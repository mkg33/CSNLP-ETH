It's past time that ATACMS should be sent.
There are literally 3,700 ATACMS in US hands already made and ready to go, this is literally the perfect war for them.
In almost all wars with the US, the US Air Force would have bombed all the high-value targets long before the US Army gets to them.
ATACMS has a "measly" 190 mile range, while the USAF was sending B-52 bombers from the continental US to bomb targets in Iraq and then flying them back home.
Even Tomahawk cruise missiles have a 1,000+ mile range.
The US Air Force and Navy is the primary long-range striking arm of the US military.
Thus the US would be fine even if we gave every ATACMS to Ukraine.
The Ukrainians already know how to use HIMARS and M270 GMLRS too.
If we don't send them, then it was a waste of money making them if they never get used and just collect dust in a warehouse somewhere, plus it would be supporting the freedom of an underdog nation.
Lastly, ATACMS is going to be retired and replaced by Precision Strike Missile anyway.
Better they be used to support a worthy cause than destroyed because the whole system simply got retired.
It would also cost money to properly dispose of them too.
S-300 is a completely different beast than patriot.
It's like a desktop vs laptop when it comes to gaming.
The desktop will obviously be better, but it has more baggage and hassle, the s-300 is far more nimble and MUCH cheaper to operate.
