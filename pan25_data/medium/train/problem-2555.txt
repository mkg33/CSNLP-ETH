I've been reading the book Justice Deferred by Orville avernin Burton and Armand Derfner.
It's about the US Supreme Court handling race issues (I'm at the Civil Rights era now).
Despite the names of the authors, it's a super interesting book that actually uses narrative flow, unlike many history books.
If this were Biden's only legacy (it's already not, to be clear), it would still be such a massive benefit to people.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

Anyways, they've made the point multiple times that while the SC is obviously important, having competent judges who uphold civil rights throughout the judiciary is crucial as well, as those judges are much closer to the action and are able to step in more immediately when there is a problem.
