China has friendly relationship with Saudi Arabia (and Iran) for many decades now.
And given the current geopolitical conditions: Russian-Ukraine war, Sanctions/Price-Cap on Russian oil , therefore China needs a more stable/back-up energy source.
SA almost always a top 1 or 2 energy source for China, therefore China needs to maintain a good relationship with SA.
SA invests way more in Europe and USA than in China and now Xi want SA to invest more in his country.
Do you really think that Saudi Arabia cares about that?
If anything, they're probably bitter and asking why they've been so nice to their mortal enemy and when they will stop cooperating with them.
I'll bet you anything that as the amount of money Saudi Arabia invests in China increases, they will start to attempt to coerce the cutting of ties with Iran.
It’s simply comical that you mention ‘disregard for human life’ and the name of the country in which 60 million people were killed by their leader to prove a political point…in the same sentence as implying that said country is merciful while the West is unquestionably evil, is…ridiculous to say the least.
I hope you realize the irony in your statement.
