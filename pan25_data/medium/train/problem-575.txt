Not for lack of trying but the cowards are afraid of hurting someone's feelings.
Look what happened when Biden called the MAGAs fascists.
If I ( I'm straight, cis, male, and white so my experience may not be the same as others) call someone a racist, homophobe, misogynist, or a transphob the reaction is usually straight to hostility from the other person.
My own dad threatened to hit me for calling him a racist (which he is).
Those words do work and elicit a response but it's not nice to say them and god forbid we don't take the high road every damn time.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
