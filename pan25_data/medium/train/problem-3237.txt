I live in a rural area and talk to trump loving Republicans every day.
These are, for the most part, people that previously weren't interested in politics.
The type of people that didn't vote because "both sides are bad".
They vote because they like trump, not because of duty to the republican party.
Some of them are just kind of trump supporters as a fuck you to the status quo.
It started as a joke for most of them and then it got real once they realized he could win.Once trump isn't in the picture anymore the majority of the trump supporters I know will go back to ignoring politics altogether or writing in meme candidates.
The GOP will scapegoat Trump for this and rebrand.
DeSantis is the future of the party.
I'm not sure if this is better or worse but I'm fairly certain finally that the Trump lead GOP is truly over and done.
His candidates lost bigly, and the far right rhetoric of many of them cost the party what should have been an easy midterm swing.
Folks over in /r/conservative seem to be sharing that position as well.
