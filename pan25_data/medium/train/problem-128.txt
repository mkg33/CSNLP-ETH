What?
Its a valid question.
The EU isnt purely an economic alliance and Hungary most certainly isnt representing the EUs core values.
On top of that Hungary isnt even a net payer, meaning they get tons of cash while simultaneously shitting on the EU.
They were the most eager of all, to the point that they waived the 7-year initial period during which people from those new member countries could not move to that country (unlike, for example, Germany) and years later the high number of EE immigrants was being leveraged to push for leaving the EU.
The whole thing should've been done way more carefully (I do think it's in overall a good thing), not rushed under pressure from some countries that were not really team members and were defending geostrategical interests of big brother across the pond.
German auto and other industrial companies need cheap labour and tax cuts for their production facilities, both of which Hungary provides.
Also a market for their goods to sell.
It is and always has been the reason.
