Cole County Circuit Court Judge Jon Beetem in a written judgment dated Monday sided with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in a years-long lawsuit against the Missouri Attorney General’s Office.
He ruled that the office under Hawley, now a Republican U.S. senator, had “knowingly and purposefully” violated the Missouri’s Sunshine Law —and fined the office $12,000.
He didn't even get fined - the "office" got fined - the office he hasn't even held for years.
Taxpayers are paying the fine to themselves.

tells Jodie Foster’s character (Elle?
), “First rule of government spending: why have one when you can build two at twice the price?”.
