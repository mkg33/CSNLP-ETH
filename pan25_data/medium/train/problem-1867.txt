If you're a Democrat, just imagine what you'd be feeling now if Trump was still president after 2020 and your friends, family, and everyone you trusted on TV told you every day, over and over that Biden had really won the election, but evil Republicans stole it from him and gave it to Trump.
While this sort of news might not be enough to make you grab a gun and start shooting, you probably wouldn't be surprised that in the face of all this "injustice" and "corruption" that someone else would use violence to fight for the cause.
Or you might feel outrage and desperation, and maybe you'd resort to violence to make sure the "other side" doesn't take over.
