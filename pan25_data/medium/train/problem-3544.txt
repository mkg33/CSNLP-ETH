I have a small understanding so I say this not as humour but as an expression of my understand… agree or disagree tell me why… i wanna know.
But are they even of use to each other… would it not just be both parties combining their problems?
I believe they would try to use each-other to no ultimate gain.
Russia would have to tanker all that oil in so I don't see it.
That said, I don't know if Cuba needs large amounts of fertilizer so that is on the table.
Actually, Cuba has a reasonable supply of trained medical professionals, including doctors, that could help Russia out a lot, especially the wealthy types.That said, I don't know what Russia can send back that is worth a shit to the Cubans in any meaningful amounts.
The US could end the embargo and compete for influence in Cuba, undermining the Russian position in Latin America generally.
But that would be too sensible.
Cuba has a shitty government, sure.
Not trading with them still allows Russia to have more influence there than we can.
The embargo seems to be an emotional reaction rather than logical geopolitics.
