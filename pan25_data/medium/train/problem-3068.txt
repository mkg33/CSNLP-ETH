Are they also going to stop farmers from just cutting them down?
If these were trees that were going to be cut down, isn't it better if they are replanted elsewhere?
I hate to be cynical, but I have a feeling this is less about protecting trees and more about the government wanting a larger cut.
They grow locally.
There's a baobab tree of some kind just down the street from where we live.
But she buys the fruits (when they're in season) from local roadside vendors.
This is correct.
One reason (out of many disparate reasons) that Kenya is poor is because most industries other than subsistence farming get undercut by the government.
I wonder if they are mistaken and the demand in Australia is locally sourced.
Importing live massive trees to Australia seems impractical.
We have really tight biosecurity laws on stuff like that as well.
My wife makes this tea from the baobab fruit.
It tastes like a really mild version of rooibos tea... and it's a nice dark red color.
It makes a nice enough drink and she drinks it for health reasons.
But now that I know what's in it, I'm going to have this drink more often.
