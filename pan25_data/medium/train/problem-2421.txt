Bonus 2: GOP will claim victory and take credit anyway for his noble Pelosi-esque move of stepping down (though a bit late since both will have been in their 80s) for the newer generation to take over by claiming their badgering and dRaInInG tHe sWaMp worked and because they rooted out the corruption of the eViL rAdIcAl dEmS and their pOlItIcIzEd fBi and DoJ hIt-sQuAd CaBaL.
All the while, they'll be oblivious to the fact that a younger, more desired and able person will hand them their asses when that person empathizes with and encourages even more young people to get out and vote for people who hear them and aren't visibly ruining peoples' lives for the sake of more power and rage-fear-theater.
The GOP is incredibly predictable, and the base is incredibly gullible.
