Especially since you can presumably get at least one by doing that thing that nobody expects where you kill someone in cold blood.
You know, shooting them from behind because there’s no real reason to suspect anyone is going to just shoot you on the street apropos of nothing.

not defending their actions but its a bit hypocritical of redditors to claim "there is nothing wrong with living at home", and then vote this as the top comment.
Its a bit like the views here on body/appearance shaming; its terrible unless the victim has political opinions that reddit disagrees with, then its peak humor, legit hilarious.
I think you missed the point of my comment and thus gave your bad faith disingenuous reply.
It's very common for people to express one opinion out of virtue while believing in the opposite on some level which slips out from time to time, either explicitly or via mannerisms.
If your stance is that people who claim "virtuous opinions" are 100% genuine in those opinions, that is extremely naive and I wouldn't bank on that.
For example, nearly everyone you run into now claims "being gay is ok and acceptable".
How much do people get mocked for just exhibiting gay tendencies?
Not even fucking close to zero.
Yeah, and we get a lot of your TV.
We are a fellow anglophone country, right next to you, with a much smaller population.
I would absolutely bank more on the former, especially with views that are not universally concrete.
For example: living at home, being fat, etc, things that people claim they are virtuous about but subconsciously are not.
