You clearly show you know nothing about thus conflict and got brainwashed.
In 1967 Syria, Egypt and Jordan attacked Israel with the sim to destroy it, Israel won in 6 days and captured lands from all of these attackers.
That’s the disputed lands of today.
Israel gave Egypt land back for peace, Jordan refused to have talks with Israel till the 90’s, so in that 30 years Jews moved into that land, that’s the settlements, the Palestinians want a state on the land Israel took from Jordan.
The Palestinians got their own independent control of areas of that land (where they are the majority) in the 90’s in peace talks with Israel.
And the Palestinians refused peace deals giving them around 97% of the disputed lands as they Israel itself as their future country and not only these lands.
(Saying no by blowing up Israeli schools, restaurants and buses) .
Ignore all that, why wont you.
It looks like Iran is just trying to shift attention away from raping and murdering their own children by threatening Israel.
