Not sure where you got your information from but the entire city of Baghdad was without power for at least weeks.
The only place that had power was the Palestine International hotel only because the Marines had brought in generators into the hotel to set up a base of operations.
Source: I was there with 11th Marines providing perimeter security for a two week rotation while waiting for Army 4th ID to arrive.
Hospitals were closed and their sick and injured were brought in to be treated by the Navy Corpsmen since like I said the entire city including the hospitals were without power.
In the dark it was easy to see the flash fire from adjacent building while we were getting shot at almost each night.
Dark and quiet mostly.
But thatâ€™s a story for another time kids.
2 million?
Where did you get those figures?
Last I heard it was about 800k but that included deaths due to the sanctions and bombings in the 90s AND all deaths from the invasion itself and the insurgency afterwards.
Time and time again Russia shows no regard for normal Ukrainian citizens or their needs and yet they somehow still have the audacity to call it a rightful "operation".
