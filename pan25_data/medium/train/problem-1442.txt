Russia has never negotiated peace in good faith and it is obvious that if a peace agreement does not restore the borders to the internationally recognized boundaries and provide Ukraine security guarantees from further invasion, Russia will try again.
It might not be Putin, but someone will try to invade again.
Hundreds of years of attempted subjugation inform our outlook on this matter.
"We do not consider statements that deepen the war conflict to be correct.
Instead of such declarations, an immediate ceasefire and peace negotiations are needed!"
the ministry said.
They're trying to buddy up to Russia while trying to not anger the rest of Europe too much.
So they're going with this faux "fairness" position.
Also, any agreement that gives up land will go down very poorly in the country.
It is our land, it is the land many people died for and many of our families were born and raised on.
The village my grandparents are from, where many family members are buried, has been destroyed, and "realistic" peace agreements would have it given to Russia.
This is not something I can ever find acceptable, and I know the sentiment is shared by many others.
