António Guterres warns in speech to general assembly that ‘chances of escalation and bloodshed are growing’.
The head of the United Nations, António Guterres, has warned that further escalation in the Russia-Ukraine conflict could mean the world is heading towards a “wider war”.
The secretary general laid out his priorities for the year in a gloomy speech to the UN general assembly that focused on Russia’s invasion, the climate crisis and extreme poverty.
Moldova would make the most sense but the russians have been more active through propaganda and threats toward finland and the baltics.
Though those countries would be way harder to take and attacking them would surely escalate everything manyfold.
Then again the original plans were seemingly to blitz through ukraine and take the northern parts of moldova.
But we haven't heard much of that since.
(Or i haven't at least, i could have missed something).
It's hard to imagine a feasible next step after ukraine for the russians.
Not that it looks like there will be a next step anytime soon.
But i will not put anything beyond the russians.
They make bad decisions.
