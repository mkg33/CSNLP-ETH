Think too about all the new things we learned about Hershel Walker after he won the primary and forced a runoff election.
But after that second election, we started learning all sorts of brand new information, for example Hershel didn't live in Georgia and he paid for even more abortions.
Those things should have come out in the primary, and again in the general.
But apparently not.
This guy is a bottom of the barrel dumbshit.
How in the fuck did none of this come up in the primary?
If you ever needed more evidence that democrats and the media are incompetent, itâ€™s this dummy getting elected to national office without a hint of his lifelong buffoonery.
If the Democrats overwhelmingly control the house and Senate, voters across the nation will start expecting them to enact meaningful change instead of working primarily for their corporate donors.
It's not incompetence, it's by design.
