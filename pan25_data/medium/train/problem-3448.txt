The Golan Heights (where this occurred) is considered Syrian land occupied by Israel because there has been no formal end to the war and therefore no treaty.
Israel gained control of the Golan Heights during the 6 Day War (1967).
Meaning Israel has controlled Golan for 55 years.
Syria only controlled it for 20 years.
The occupation of Golan isn't covered by the media the same as the occupation of the West Bank.
Largely because the Druze who live in Golan are content.
Yeah theyâ€™ve been going at it for a longgg time.
I spent a good bit of time in Israel and around the Golan region.
Had the opportunity to spend time amongst the Druze people and honestly had an amazing time.
They were just vibing in the midst of a very tense war zone, being lovely people, making the worlds most delicious hummus and falafel.
Yeah the Druze are bad ass and great friends to Jews.
They help defend people in the IDF and take no crap from anyone.
, When Palestinian terrorists stole a kid on life support(killing him in the process), some armed Druze got them to give the body back, it was terrible that the kid died.
Either way, both are poor parallels to the situation in a Golan Heights.
A more relevant comparison is how I feel about the Soviet Union taking control of Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland and eastern Germany after WWII.
I feel that the Allies were more than justified in taking territory from the Axis.
And that it was done in accordance with international law.
By 1967, Syria should have known that Israel would keep any territory that it gained in war.
And they chose to roll the dice.
