I’m a doctor.
Currently got $340,000 in student loan debt (which is down almost $100,000 in the last 2 years).
I don’t qualify for forgiveness.
I support it, but also know it’s not a good answer to the problem of runaway cost of education and predatory loan rates (by our own government).
I fortunately earn a great wage so I’ll do just fine without the one time forgiveness of $10,000.
That being said, I think the lack of interest during COVID has done more for me and others than a one time payment can ever do.
If they want to solve this issue they need to invest in citizens’ educations, not profit off of them.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
