Ever since flipping the Virginia statehouse lost by 1 vote (after Republicans violated the unambiguous rules for counting ballots and just decided that one extra ballot meant to check Republican, followed by drawing lots which, surprise, Republicans won like always) I've never thought my vote doesn't matter.
Vote tabulation rules said "where a person checks multiple selections on a single race, that vote isn't counted for that race".
Nonetheless, they just said "well, but we want to" and counted it for Republicans.
