More than that, though, as to the comparison to Alphabet or Apple and their relationship to the US government, China's entire internet infrastructure is wholly owned and operated by the Chinese government.

Vast differences exist that are important to some people, less so to others.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
