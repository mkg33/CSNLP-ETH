I am Buddhist.
If some nutcase decides to burn Buddhist scriptures, I will shrug them off and continue my business.
The most crucial thing is Buddha’s teaching, not the book containing it.
I said it’s pretty disrespectful, but would you do that to an image of Muhammad?
(Yes I know, there are no images of Muhammad because it’s not allowed in Islam).
He said “fuck no, I would get killed for that”.
Ugh, everyone involved in this mess needs to grow up.
It is a book.
The only time I have a problem with people burning books is when it isn't their book.
If it's your property you can do whatever you want with it.
I’m a construction worker, and we were doing renovation work at a High school.
Someone put a high vis vest on a statue of Jesus, and taped a smoke in his mouth.
My foreman says “that must piss you off”.
That said, to publicly do something just to piss people off is such a childish behavior.
The only thing you prove by doing it is that you're an ass.
Unfortunately, as long as the other side reacts then the asses get what they wanted.
