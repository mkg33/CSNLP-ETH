This subpoena bullshit is a microcosm, but Republicans have no rock bottom.
They have no level they won’t stoop beneath, and Democrats have allowed Republicanism to fester because they continue to constantly play nice and are far too accepting of fascist bullshit I’m the name of “bringing both sides together.”.
No amount of playing nice is going to stop insane people from calling you demonic radicals when you do even extremely mild policy changes.
Maybe the Democrats should stop trying to fucking appease Republicans.

Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Although it would be a real fuck-you to R's if he does a Trump, he really shouldn't.
He needs to honour it, to show how much Trump was such an anomaly.
Doing otherwise would set a precedent.
It’s not about playing nice.
Once you condone fascism, even fascism-lite, it’s hard to come back.
How can we be anti-fascism if we engage in it ourselves?
There is a danger to following their lead and it has nothing to do with appeasing Republicans and everything to do with honoring our democracy.
