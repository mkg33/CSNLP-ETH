Not this time America.
You got away with it with that woman who didn't have diplomatic immunity but you pretended she did and then wouldnt even think about signing an extradition warrant for her to return to stand trial for the teen she murdered by driving on the wrong side of the road until recently.
This time the UK judges aren't taking any chances with America pissing us around.
Break our laws and expect the consequences.
Its what we would expect in America so why shouldn't it be the same here.
Yup.
Break the law in another country, face the law in another country.
I just went to Italy and always have the understanding that when I’m in a foreign country, I follow their laws.
"So what you're saying is you're legally employed by the US military industrial complex to drive or maintain some of the most advanced vehicles and equipment the US has to offer yet you can't handle a Honda accord?
What makes you think the US Airforce has any jurisdiction here to make a fair and impartial judgement?
".
In the UK, murder is a kind of homicide.
The most serious kind, but you there must be an intention of causing injury or death.
I don’t know if negligence can rise to the level of homicide, but I wouldn’t be surprised.
