It's completely absurd that someone would try to portray a new Russian Kyiv offensive as a viable plan on a military strategic/operational level.
Ukraine has had almost a year now to prepare fortifications, the terrain is heavily disadvantageous to any attacker, and it doesn't even divert many Ukrainian resources as they can use mostly TDF to hold the region.
Ukraine was utterly unprepared the first time around and even then the assault failed despite Russia committing a large force + their most elite troops there.
If Belarus were really bothered, maybe they'd stop pushing migrants across the border into Poland via the Białoweiża forest and focus on their own thing.
I mean we will see how much influence Belarus actually has over it's army.
Considering there is a Belarusian military unit in Ukraine fighting Russian that can always return home I doubt they actually deploy or it lasts long than Belarus government.
Also a civil war in Belarus would force Russia to divert military power to Belarus.
