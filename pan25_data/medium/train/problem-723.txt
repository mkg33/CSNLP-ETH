Yeah, sure.
If these dictator regimes didn't lie and con people all the time with propaganda, then you may be able to believe these assholes from time to time.
90% of all legislation is passed by bi-partisan and they all go to the same parties, the same schools, the same social networks.
To think Democrats are sterling and Republicans are duplicitous is to reveal you yourself are brainwashed.
Equating the two major parties of the US to be morally equivalent because there is seeming corruption within both ranks is a disingenuous argument.
The OP wasn't stating the Democratic Party Politicians are "sterling", I don't think anyone would ever say that.
Whataboutism is a shield for the most corrupt in the GOP (or, internationally, for autocrats) to deflect criticism and excuse their crimes.
Well the world isn't the US and I'm not American as everyone on Reddit immediately assumes.
Generally in liberal democracies as opposed to the corrupt, Iranian theocracy, at least there is an opposition fir several parties.
At least there is a wise free media to debate and expose the issues, at least the people can vote them out.
At least the judiciary can send politicians to prison if needed.
As long as the law enforcement can independently charge and investigate corrupt politicians.
