I was hoping a Brazilian could answer a question I have: The election between Lula and Bolsenaro was pretty close, but have recent events changed opinions much?
I can't imagine that after what's happened that Bolsenaro would be any more popular, but have there been any major shifts in opinion?
One I've heard was "the exact same thing happened in Dilma's impeachment (left wing president), people broke everything, and nobody called it terrorism".
I asked for evidence and they showed me a video of protesters breaking 1 glass door and getting beat up by police.
After I pointed out it is way different in size of destruction, police response, etc (ffs the original constitution was going around people's hands) they just said "no it is not this video, it is in another one, let me find it, I must have deleted it".
I'm not Brazilian, but if it's anything like in the States then probably not that much; some non-Bolsonarist conservatives, and maybe a moderate fringe of the Bolsonaristas, might have moved away from him or started denouncing him, but I'd assume that would have begun to occur when he started casting doubt on the integrity of elections (so, a while ago already).
Apart from that, I assume those that didn't like him still don't, and those that like him have doubled down on their extremist delusions, much like with Trump.
When we say people are living in a parallel reality, it is not an exagerattion.
Their even believe they have proof of things that they don't.
They conjure the images in their imagination and think they are real.
