Nevada race will be close but every projection and election guru says Dems are favorites right now.
That’s 50.

Lake was supposed to be the next Republican superstar.
She was being rumored as a potential running mate for the next Republican nominee.
She also encouraged armed poll watching.
This assumes she isn't in prison in 2024, lol.
I fully expect her to go further in calling for an armed insurrection than Trump did on January 6th.
This is 99% likely if Lake wins AZ due to AZ’s nature as being in play as one of the two newest swing states.
Ohio and Florida aren’t swing states anymore and too expensive for Democrats to play in.
PA, AZ, GA, WI, MI, that’s the battleground and Lake, despite being a true fascist, has camera presence that is perfectly suited or the media to give her credence when she should be ignored or derided.
