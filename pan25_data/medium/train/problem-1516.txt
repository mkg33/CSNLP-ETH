They don’t even care about the laptop, not them or their followers.
They just want to use it to say “see your team is doing it too” cuz to them it’s a team sport and they want their team to win no matter what.
They don’t care about themselves or their country, politics is entertainment to them.
Because their lives already suck or they want to hold onto power however they can.

With an article basically "proving" the raid was wrong because "trump took the documents for his ego not monetary gain".
That wall thing is just a glaring homage to their xenophobia.
Our stuff is so much better over here we gotta keep everyone out our stuff = dumpster on fire.
