Edit: My biggest hangup was always the ridiculously poor decision making.
It’s the flight home.
You can’t smoke it on the plane anyways…throw it away and get more when you get home.
Not worth the risk, and ‘oops’ isn’t an excuse…go through your stuff before traveling.
There’s always the possibility he’ll get sent to Ukraine.
The Ukrainians have made a habit of dispatching high priority individuals regularly during this conflict.
On the other incentives matter and maybe we generally shouldn’t be swapping random hostages taken for transparent reasons for people hostile powers want.
And really people should know not to travel to Russia/China/Iran etc.
Not insensitive, spot on.
That Bitch new what she was being over there.
Trading her for a person who has killed many US military personnel is beyond disgusting, it’s ATROCIOUS.
Still not sure the swap is good, even with the context of the USA having done these sorts of swaps regularly for the past several decades.
I am under the impression the dude got caught because his high profile clients went out of business, and he was trying to find new ones when we got him.
