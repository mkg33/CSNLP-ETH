Fun fact, ensuring access to food was at one time considered a vital national defense interest.
During World War II the average American soldier and seaman gained any where from 20 to 30 pounds because they had 3 solid meals a day.
Before entering service many did not have secure access to food or regular meals.
It was noted that the average draftee was underweight and exceptions were made to ensure the bodies needed to fill out the military were there.
It's also been noted that access to food and regular meals has major implications on children being successful in school and impacts the development of eating and metabolic disorders.
There are also correlations to mortality and overall health.
The food crisis is an understated issue I think.
With prices so high already and SNAP benefits ending, we're at serious risk of a major starvation crisis in this country, and it just seems to be ignored in the midst of record profits.
The opposition to programs like SNAP is far less based on facts and more platitudes like "boot straps" and "rugged individualism."
It's another self inflicted wound on the country by political leaders blindly following an ideology rather the pragmatically approaching a serious problem.
