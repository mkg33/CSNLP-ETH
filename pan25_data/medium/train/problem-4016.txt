Look at World War 2 numbers.
Their strategy has always been to outlast by sending wave after wave.
They lost more than a million men in the battle of Stalingrad alone within a 6 month period.
I get the impression the current demographic really doesn't have much desire to die in Ukraine for an absolutely pointless cause.
True but they're threatening them if they don't.
They still seem to be fighting since it's a stalemate at the moment.
Ukraine needs longer ranged missiles to keep pushing.
Putin's just going to keep targeting energy infrastructure to draw this war out.
Russia lost hundreds of thousands of able-bodied men two months back when they announced mobilization.
The same will happen again.
True, times have changed.
But so far they're sticking to that playbook.
Fighting mostly with artillery, waves of infantry and counting on winters.
is it even remotely possible that some Russian citizens believe that Ukraine/west intends on invading Russia, and therefore brainwashed into this "special operation".
Modern military strategy: Send tactical strikes and focus on disrupting the enemy for maximal efficiency.
Russian military strategy: Throw people and rockets at the enemy and hope that the enemy forfeits before you run out of things to throw.
