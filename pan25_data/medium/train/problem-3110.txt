Regarding the incident, the Chinese do not seem take a sophisticated approach (which likely has more mileage in a heavily censored country) and Xi (leader of a "democracy with Chinese characteristics" and completely full of shit) may have just been feigning a belief that "leaks" had occurred (in what appeared to be staged confrontation given the camera--and translator moving out of the way).
His lecture and posturing makes little sense in any context if presumed honest.
There is straightforward motive for an autocrat to try to establish a pecking order given rapid escalation between the two countries (eg forced divestment of Chinese mining companies in Canada, arrest of alleged Chinese spy, and pronouncement of Chinese interference in Canadian democracy).
I found this whole thing super interesting because the YouTube video is a wall of pro President Xi and anti PM Trudeau comments.
Thereâ€™s a second YouTube video entirely with Chinese characters and all the comments translated to English are pro PM Trudeau.
Then this has been posted on Reddit multiple times and the comments are mostly pro PM Trudeau (and reasonable comments at that).
