"When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, it promised to “return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives.” In virtually every instance in which it’s been returned to the people, which has mostly happened by ballot initiative and referendum, the people have acted to protect reproductive rights.
Perhaps that explains why less than a year after the fall of Roe, conservative activists are trying to put the issue of abortion access into the hands of a single man for whom no one ever voted.

"State's rights" has always been a weird argument.
They basically only argue that when they are losing.
They wanted abortion to be federally illegal, after Roe it became a state's rights issue.
The same was true for marriage equality.
If they do ever achieve a state's rights victory it's back to arguing for making it federal policy.
They are also very much against state's rights when a state decides to do something that doesn't agree with their agenda.
When Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage, conservatives were trying to get the federal government to block it.
