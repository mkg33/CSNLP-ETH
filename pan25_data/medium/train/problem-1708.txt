You want to stop people from taking it in?
Make their lives better.
You can't do that with a promise to plant more trees and push electric vehicles.
People need their bellies fed, and their fears of financial destitution and homelessness to be alleviated.
Only then can you ensure propaganda finds no fertile soil.
If you fail to do that, than it is on those that failed to do it.
“We have K-pop.
We have K-dramas.
But we don’t have K-comedy.
What’s something that the world can laugh at that comes from Korea?”.
What i dislike about k-stuff is that trend that every story have to revolve around a love story.
So far i didn't found any that didn't have a love centric story.
:/ I would like to found one dark detective Korean series that is not "Ho i am a hardass that will forever be alone."
Pop the hardass female counter part.
Some sexual tension build up and bam they end up together.
:/.
I mean there there is some exception like squid game and Sweet home.
(Both master pieces) but usually it's always revolving around love.
