He is the most victimized man in the universe.
He’s been a Jew, he’s been a gay, he’s been a migrant worker.
He’s done it all and we should feel sorry for him and give him more money.
Oh yes you did Don't play innocent Innocente like a little Infantino We're wise to you, you hypocrite football fan.
My prediction is the after this one no world Cup is ever held in the middle East, and probably Fifa will be forced to change.
I hope at least that happens.
Right.
They promised westerners that there will be places to drink beer, then they only let pregnant women in.
They've broken so many promises: no cooked kosher food for Jews, for example.
Food stall vendors denied food, water and bathroom breaks for 7 hours.
I hope FIFA is paying attention.
Yeah you're right Fifa will likely go back to these terrible places.
Power and money is all the thing terrible people care about, and for sure that is Fifa.
Well, "ever" is a long time, but there are plenty of hellhole dictatorships elsewhere, so it should be a while before Afghanistan or Iran get a turn.
But the days of the World Cup being held in democracies seem to be over.
Hosting the World Cup is great for political leaders (especially if they're corrupt), but it sucks for the people.
So countries where the people have a say in what happens aren't going to host it.
They removed it a few days before the games.
That is garbage to anyone that spent big money to the games.
If the plan was never to sell beer than they should have announced it from the start not a few days before!
