His speech is very telling.
He’s basically saying that he doesn’t like how the budget is under scrutiny and wants to go back to the “old way” of just having the government give them whatever they want without scrutiny or questions.
And if anyone wonders what the old ways were here's a good podcast from Dan Carlin with Fred Kaplan (author of The Wizards of Armageddon):
They were literally throwing random numbers like "we need 1 000 nukes to destroy x", and they would be given it lol.
Which is crazy outdated.
Maybe those numbers made sense in the era of B52 swarms delivering bombs but in the 21st century an ICBM attack is pretty much unstoppable.
Multiple warheads on a ballistic entry from outer fucking space along with a ton of decoys are not something that can be defeated.
Full stop.
We don't need 4,000 nukes.
Spread some ICBMs out on submarines and land based silos and you're fine, 200 will do.
400 if you want to be super duper over armed.
"Oh sorry, we can only destroy 25 major Chinese population centers and 250 million people while still accepting a 50% failure rate AND keeping half the nuclear fleet in reserve" boohoo, sorry we can only destroy you to 2 full fledged superpowers in nuclear armageddon in an era where only one other superpower exists.
