I still remember my assistant debate coach in college telling me about an acquaintance of his who went to Bob Jones and the time he got kicked out of the library and risked much worse.
Apparently, one of the staff members thought he was staring inappropriately at a group of girls he knew--and by that, I mean just noticing that they were in the room--and decided to tell him about it.
He responded by letting the staff member know that it was a good thing he was wearing his glasses, lest they get pregnant.
As one might imagine, it went over quite poorly.
