The reason this EU-NATO partnership is significant is because Sweden and Finland want to join NATO but are being blocked by Turkey.
While Turkey has the power to do this they don’t have the power to block NATO and the EU from more closely working together which means Sweden and Finland can get more of the benefits of NATO even if they’re not able to join outright.
It should be remembered that one of NATO’s biggest strenhs is that the militaries all coordinate and standardize everything so they can essentially work together as one big unit rather than 30 independent militaries.
We will happily help them secure their freedom, but let's not make light of what this war costs for the People of Ukraine.
For all the bickering and arguing, we Americans see Europeans as Brothers and helping them stand strong benefits everyone.
I can see a future with a Europe that is whole and able to defend herself alone, standing shoulder to shoulder with America as equals sharing the load as we perpetuate not American or European, but Western Hegemony over Planet Earth.
