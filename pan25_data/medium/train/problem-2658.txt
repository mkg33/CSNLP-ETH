Modern slavery isnt like Roman slavery or that practiced in pre-Civil war USA.
Its about controlling, usually vulnerable people forcing them to work, withholding wages etc.
Including charging them for air tickets and accommodation via a debt that thry have to repay.
Then paying them such low wages, that they can never pay their debts off (indentured slavery).
It's highly unlikely that they were chained up, branded and whipped.
Especially as thry worked at care homes where they met the public.
It seems that a a care agency that they through.
First raised the alarm.
Due to their disheveled appearance and that they were always hungry.
I knew a night cleaner who's boss kept getting him deals on used cars and would loan him the money for them...
The he'd have to drive for hours and spend most of his money on owning a shit car (gas, maintenance, insurance, paying back his boss) and rent... Then his boss got him a place closer to work for a decent price, but it was his boss's second property....dude made minimum wage and was paid on salary, he was in his 60's...it was the closest thing to slavery I've ever seen...
