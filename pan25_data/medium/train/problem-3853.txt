I agree.
We shouldn't underestimate the anger and humiliation that stem from the past.
That said, at least China seems to be more rational and I hope they see the failure of Russia and use that as an example.
China have developed a lot in the past decade, but they are still far behind the West in terms of military and economic power.
I imagine Xi is begging Biden to pretend his threats are credible so he can continue LARPing as a strongman.
Look no further than NATO last-gen hand-me-downs utterly obliterating Russia’s best equipment… Yea, China buys theirs from those imbeciles.
From everything my chinese ex (plus her family and acquaintances) said over the years, I think it's safe to say China has an enormous chip on its shoulder over what they call "the century of humiliation" and will have for the foreseeable future.
I hope they understand that this is not the time for war, because this is not something they can afford at the moment or even years in the future.
China have a lot of problem they need to solve.
For their own good and the good of the world, they should focus on that.
