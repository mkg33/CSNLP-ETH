I can understand point 1 holding right up until the 20th century when the Supreme Court started to side with legislatures in eroding the right to contract.
Point 2 doesn't hold much water though because it still needs something to attach to for equal protection under the law.
If there is no right to contract freely, meaning the state can regulate contracts, and that regulation is applied equally to all persons, and the regulation does not violate some other protected status provided by the Constitution, then I fail to see where the "Constitution has always protected gay marriage.
".
