In australia we’ve have an ongoing civil case surrounding Australian special forces killing innocent civilians (confirmed crimes of war) - they all seemed to take great pride in the people they killed.
They took videos & photos with the dead, took commemorative items from the dead (were drinking from a dead person’s prosthetic leg) amongst other horrible things - they all definitely seemed to enjoy it.
& the main person involved is arguably one of Australia’s most awarded member of our special forces.
In one of the Jack Reacher books, the main character breaks down why people join the military.
Some do it for patriotism, some for family tradition, some to escape their living situation, some for the opportunities, some for personal growth.
And there’s also some that just want to kill people.
Huh... A guy that doesn't value human life and takes pleasure in destroying it is a Republican conspiracy theorist and avid denier of reality?
I have an older work colleague who recently told me he joined the Marines for that reason when he was younger - It made me walk back a few of the heated arguments I had previously had with him, where he was convinced the democrats were antichrist, and that dinosaurs never existed - these almost came to blows!
