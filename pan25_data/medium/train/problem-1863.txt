And that 300 billion in frozen Russian assets should also be forfeit and given to Ukraine to rearm and rebuild.
Don't wait for peace, do it now while the extra money could buy Ukraine what they need to win the war.
The funds don't necessarily need to be released right this moment based on the way the lend lease program works and is set up right now between partner states.
Literally, whatever the priority is can be done, but it likely doesn't make sense to rebuild anything other than critical infrastructure and maintaining services.
I'm not surprised that they said so, I'm only surprised that Russia isn't already using that as a means of terrorizing their own population into further submission.
The money is frozen and can be used once the war ends but will highly likely go to setting up a repayment plan once Ukraine has done what they need to.
Ukraine is Russia's current Vietnam or Afganistan.
They can't win and the longer they stay the worse it gets for them in every possible way.
Except that during Vietnam and the US, British and USSR's attempts in Afganistan there were no international sanctions.
Imagine if the US took property from the families of war protestors during the Vietnam "police action."
Its a shame Putin didn't learn much from that embarrassing chapter in US history.
