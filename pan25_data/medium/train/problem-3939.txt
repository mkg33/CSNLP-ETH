I have low faith in it.
When a goverment has all the power, all the money and the military on their side.
It's really hard for them to lose their power.
Authoritarian governments have survived for years.
Look at North Korea, Cuba and Venezuela.
They might never be liberated.
Maybe I'm overly pessimistic, but hey, I've lived through some of it, so I think I'm just being realistic.
The real world is usually darker than we are lead to believe and history is written by the victors.
The reason for including her age in the title?
The reason for the comma?
The reason for including her age but not writing "years old"?
There's a famous book (and movie) from Korea with the same style of title, Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982, so it's not that unorthodox of a title.
The idea is to make it sound like someone introducing themselves, it gives auto-biography vibes.
The title is a self-introduction with the main character stating her name and age.
It's about the story of a 15-year old girl who marries an adult businessman, get divorced after four months and then finds out she's pregnant with his baby.
She then makes the decision to keep the baby and be a single mother.
