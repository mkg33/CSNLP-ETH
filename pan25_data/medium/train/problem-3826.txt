Nancy Pelosi earned a fair share of criticism, even from inside her tent, but that tent never grew unruly, and rarely was anyone confused about who was in charge, unlike with the Republican caucus.
Well if nothing else, he negotiated his own job down to the point where any random person in the House can attempt to get him kicked out.

Please if you have any questions or concerns.
I'd think the main difference simply comes down to the number of votes.
Pelosi had a majority, and McCarthy didn't.
So of course they're both going to have different levels of being-in-charge.
But perhaps I'm mixing up cause and effect.
We know why McCarthy didn't have a majority.
But why did Pelosi?
Surely there must have been "more progressive" Democrat reps who didn't like Pelosi, because she wouldn't allow _their_ desired legislation to get a vote, or otherwise wouldn't do things that they wanted.
