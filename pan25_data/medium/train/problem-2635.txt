The Russians have been giving them tech for decades though.
This is not even in dispute.
While western intelligence agencies are pretty hush about it for whatever reason, it is that Russia began formally supplying them with surplus Soviet rocket engines sometime around 2015.
But to go from their shitty SCUD knockoffs to legitimate multi-stage missiles and SLBMs takes more than just a few rocket engines.
It requires a degree of materials science and electronics sophistication they clearly do not demonstrate elsewhere in their society.
Many have even suggested that their newest second stage (which has been a game changer for them) is effectively manufactured in Iran, smuggled into NK in parts, and the assembled there.
Or do you really think a country which can't even build its own airplanes somehow managed to build advanced ICBM tech?
Nah, they aren't spending much money on it.
In fact Russia is likely giving them the tech and paying them for these provocations.
But if youâ€™re making rockets that you plan on just firing into the sea as a bluff?
I could see them building that entirety on their own.
Then iteratively improving on it over a generation with imported components.
