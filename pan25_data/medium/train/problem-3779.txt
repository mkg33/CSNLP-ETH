Authoritarians don't care about the "scandals" they scream about.
They don't care about sincerity.
They care about power, and they care about scoring political points against those who they view as weaker than themselves, by whatever means necessary.
The view the world as "us vs. them", and they trust the "leaders" of their team, and will regurgitate whatever the leaders of their team say, and view submission to their chosen leaders of their team and signaling a membership to their team to be the utmost moral action one can do.
This leads to them screaming about any infraction (or even perceived infraction, or even a completely contrived infraction, such as Marin) on the other side, the second they hear anyone else on their side talking about such a scandal.
It doesn't mean that they actually care about it, just that they have some ammunition, whatsoever, to attack their opponents with.
As a sober alcoholic, I will say that attempting to stop a few times never killed me (obviously) but I would not want to be in public during withdrawals.
The shakes, the insane anxiety, the cold sweats...
The anxiety alone will make you look like you've lost your mind.
The drop of a pin could scare the shit out of you.
