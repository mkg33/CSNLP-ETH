Iâ€™m starting to think that many past presidents likely have some number of classified documents in their office or in their home.
I firmly believe that if that guy stole any secrets, it was to help some people in need somewhere, a case of stealing a loaf of bread to feed a community.
I think Biden is the original owner of that Corvette.
He is probably never selling it, but it also very rarely moves.
Its not like he's out there commuting and doing burnouts everyday in a 67 Vette, even though there's a video of him doing the later with Jay Leno.
The difference, however, is that Biden found the documents and turned them into the national archives.
Then he found more in his house.
He turned those in as well.
And as far as we know, he only had a few.
Trump had hundreds of classified documents spread across dozens of boxes and fought giving them back to the archives when requested.
He ignored subpoenas.
He did not cooperate and broke the law.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
\- Trump (apparently willfully) doesn't return documents: Get asked, get asked again and again.
Get raided.
