That's not discrimination.
From my comment on the other time you linked this article in this thread...
The true measure of a leader is not the powers they take, but when when they relinquish those powers.
It's a hyperpolitical war & he's banned the legality of any Political opposition to his rule.
I didn't expect another European Hitler arch either, but here we are.
Yes I don’t like the content because it’s manipulative and paints a false picture of what is actually happening, the so called “”authoritarian”” he signed is actually to help them integrate into the EU, you dumbass/troll got clickbaited.
Tl;dr on the article, complaining that Ukraine won't drop Ukrainian language requirements for minority groups nor give them special legislative representation.
Some examples are...
- an independent e.g.
Romanian newspaper can't operate out of Ukraine without publishing everything in both Ukrainian and Romanian, and the Ukrainian government won't sponsor the translation for them just so they can meet the requirement.
All this is not quite in the spirit of full proactive support for freedom of speech, but it's a very far cry from anything authoritarian or discriminatory.
Replace Romanian with Russian in the examples, and I think the problem with the asks becomes immediately obvious.
- a Ukrainian village that happens to be largely e.g.
Romanian speaking can't fully convert everything to Romanian without also including Ukrainian, the country's language--even after a local government vote to do so.

- an e.g.
Romanian minority group does not get legal priority when considering other legislation, nor gets its own special legislative representation.
It's not discriminatory to not provide special treatment to minority groups in lieu of an official national language.
It would be strange to me to see Romania or Hungary or what have you not having any enforcement on using their respective national language in their be own countries.
Though I do suspect Ukrainian policy goes further than some EU country ones do, given the at best tense history with their much less friendly immediate neighbor.

Don't know enough to comment on compatibility, beyond that the recommendations mentioned in the article weren't followed.
But I do know that some similar EU membership commissions have previously recommended rules which were not even followed by France and Germany.
Based on that alone, I'm skeptical about the compatibility claim.
But happy to be educated!
