They also appear to be showing off how well they are doing in the excess calorie department.
I always wonder how it REALLY plays with poor, half starved North Koreans.
Are they truly brainwashed, or is there immense rage buried deep under a protective disguise of awe in the name of self preservation?
Remember about two years ago he looked like he'd lost a bunch of weight?
There were rumors that he may have had some health issues or was purposely trying to be healthier.
She is kinda scary and seems to be way more dangerous than her brother.
Wouldn’t surprise me, if she is just waiting for the right moment to have those two removed.
He seems to be having health issues considering he constantly disappeared from public for weeks at a time.
I can’t help but wonder if she’s just waiting for him to die and biding her time/building her support so when he does she can take over.
Also very interested to see how the top brass will react.
Currently it feels like North Korea only has two likely successors and both are female.
It’s a fairly misogynistic culture from what I’ve read so I’m curious to see if they would just let it happen or if there would be more energy to overthrow a female ruler from the old men who run the day to day things.
As a woman in NK she most likely has to be endless harder, tougher and meaner than a male in order to get the same respect and fear out of her people.
I am just worried that she is also way more aggressive and unlike her chubby brother, she means business.
