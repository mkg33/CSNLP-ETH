An inspector with 22 years of experience earns 1864.19 euro gross per month, with a bonus payment of 425 euro gross (I'm not sure if this bonus is monthly or annual).
According to the SNCF, between 2012-2015 an on-board customer service agents in the middle of their career earned 2400 per month, station managers earned 30,996 euro annually, and drivers earned 34,741 annually.
And that's before including the bonus.
The French government statistics website INSEE says that the average net salary in the private sector was 16.30 euro per hour in 2020.
At a 35 hour week, that's a net salary of 2282 per month, so yes it would seem that ticket inspectors are being underpaid.
Union leaders say the strike is meant to draw more attention to rules requiring that members work three weekends per month and sleep away from home for more than 10 nights per month.
The conductors' union met twice with management without progress before the strike.
Other unions joined in support, and have filed strike notice for both the Christmas and New Year's weekends to put pressure on SNCF.
So is this strike about money alone?
What does it mean exactly to give the strikers more "recognition"?
Or is the real issue the workers want to be reclassified so that they qualify to form their own official union?
