It's not just about taking people's money; he's an extreme narcissist who needs to be the center of attention like a drug addict needs crack.
His ego craves the adulation of his huge army of worshippers, as well as the immense power of the presidency (e.g., standing on the world stage with all the world's leaders and being taken seriously by them, being able to single-handedly shred treaties, commanding the military, complete immunity from prosecution).
Yes, he's a grifter, but he's driven by a lot more than just his desire to enrich himself at this point (which makes him a lot more dangerous).
The most beautiful thing in the world would be to have De Santis with the Republican nomination and Trump running as an Independent.
Would be an incredible mess and so enjoyable to watch.
