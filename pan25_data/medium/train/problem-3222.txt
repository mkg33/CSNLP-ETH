Here in WV it's hard to overlook the fact that many people simply vote red because it's their tribe.
And within the red choices, the colorful and crazy candidates seem to get more votes than competent and careful ones.
WV pitted the chair of the WV Republican Party, McKinley, against a relative newcomer, Mooney, in the last Congressional primary.
McKinley had done far more for the state, Mooney was endorsed by Trump.
Mooney won.
And Mooney, too, voted to deny the Presidential election on Jan 6.
