It also has the effect of draining resources away from universities.
Wisconsin eliminated tenure for their college professors years ago.
Along with the wage freeze of the time, it created a brain drain of professors leaving for greener pastures.
Wisconsin universities in a bid to remain competitive with their out of state counterparts, found alternate ways to compensate professors.
One of the solutions was to increase research budgets for professors, and they came up with the money by cutting other resources to other departments.
It basically creates a situation where the university cannibalizes itself, taking away resources from students in an effort to keep the best professors.
This article is morbidly hilarious to me.
I can list on more than one hand the amount of conservative professors who tried to sneak in their republican opinions on completely unrelated subjects in very inappropriate ways—an abuse of authority if I ever saw one—and have also been pushing hard for their own tenures.
Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?
Bwahahahaha.
