And then what?
Let's think about the situation here: The EU's has been fairly consistent over the past decade () so to no one's surprise that means renewables are replacing some of the existing fossil fuel power plants.
Subsidies cover part of the cost of construction, generation, and maintenance and they sell all of the power that gets generated to customers for money.
If there's a power deficit due to a lower "capacity factor" they have to make it up by spending even more of their money to build more renewables which further eats into their profit margins.
Based on the numbers above that's an effective power generation rate of 7%.
I don't know about you but frankly I don't see how that is a winning proposition even if there were massive subsidies.
They might be unwilling to go green for CO2 levels.
But thereâ€™s a persuasive argument that oil, gas and coal can be in short supply.
But nobody can switch off the Sun or wind.
Self-reliance appeals to conservatives, so this idea of making our own energy is sensible IMO.
