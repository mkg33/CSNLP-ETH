Turkey has a centralized online healthcare/hospital system that keeps records of every doctor's appointment, every diagnosis, every x-ray, etc.
you've had.
If they've ever had their mouths x-rayed, it's in the system.
This is somewhat true.
Only the people who have been fingerprinted, most identifing features archived and sometimes DNA samples taken are counted.
Government officials say they are buried only after these are done.
Ofc with how large the area is, there are some dead unofficially collected by their families who dug them out.
Or the dead who is still under rubble.
They will have to be registered dead at one point though, so after a few weeks we might get the actual final death toll.
I would assume they also use dental records, since they are often used for identification in other cases as well... Because they are often the last thing to be destroyed on a body.
Yeah, that's quite useful.. We don't have such a thing as dental records to be used in situations like this one where I'm from, that's why I was asking.
