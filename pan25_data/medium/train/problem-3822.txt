I didn’t get a supplement because the premiums are kinda expensive so I got the Advantage plan which at least limits my MOOP.
Mine is with a good local non profit insurance company.
Being in NY, I can switch to a supplement at any open enrollment.
Perhaps the companies are being paid too much per enrolled person- I don’t know.
I do like having the option.

This is not a Medicare Supplement.
They Supplement actual Medicare.
Medicare Advantage is instead of Medicare plus Supplement.
You replace a government insurance plan (Medicare) with a private for profit insurance plan.
The Supplement is also private but it covers the 20% copay in Medicare Part B.
