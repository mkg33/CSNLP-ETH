If you zoom out enough, it's ww3 in all but the world's soldiers.
It's the world that funds and the media that fuels, and Ukraine is the theater.
when all the world's economies are tied together, everyone is entangled in some aspect of everyone else's affairs.
That’s an odd take, I would have thought the war was fueled by Russian aggression … the west has collectively provided aid to Ukraine to defend itself but the war would be over tomorrow if the Russian withdrawal their troops from occupied Ukraine territory, so the only fuel is Russian militarism.
its also a safeguard against direct conflict between countries with highly interdependent economies (actively reducing foreign investment and logistics is a predictor of future war), as engaging in war with a trading partner would harm your national supply chains.
“no, it’s the consequence of globalization” could just as easily be “yes, it’s the consequence of globalization”.
Two sides of the same coin.
If it’s on the coin, it’s still the coin.
