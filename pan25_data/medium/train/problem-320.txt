"Precisely at civilians.
At ordinary people.
At the market, elevator, gas station, bus station, residential building.
The list of the dead so far includes ten people, there are many wounded.
".
But why always compare with america?
Everyone knows that they are a warmongering shithole of a Country, built on blood.
Why wanna be like them, i dont understand.
Well, it's quite simple: every victim of fighting age (above roughly 13 or so) is an enemy combatant.
That's how America declared every mosque they bombed a terrorist training cell.
At least 10 people are dead after Russian shelling bombarded the eastern Ukraine town of Kurakhove on Wednesday after Russia launched a "deliberate strike" at civilians.
President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the strike on the town as "very brutal" in his nightly video address on Wednesday.
Kurakhove is in the Donetsk region, which has seen some of the heaviest fighting since Russia's war on Ukraine began.
Shame America and other countries can't send some troops over and fuck up those sad excuses for existence known as the Russian army and it's higher ups.
