"In fact, virtually every time a Latin American country replaced the electoral college with the popular vote, the change came in response to a major political crisis.
For instance, in Brazil, direct presidential elections were held for the first time after its monarchy was replaced by a republic in 1894.
In Colombia, the change came after a military dictatorship was overthrown and replaced with a new constitution in 1910.
In Mexico, direct presidential elections followed a revolution in 1917.
In Venezuela, a free and fair election was held for the first time in a brief interlude between dictatorships in 1947.
And Argentina undertook a major constitutional reform a few years after getting rid of a military dictatorship and establishing democracy in 1994.
