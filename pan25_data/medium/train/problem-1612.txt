Ya, I'm actually kinda confused by the article and I suspect it's because the writer has no clue about technology.
If you have a relatively modern car, it's going to have a SIM (likely eSIM) chip _somewhere_ in the vehicle.
Whether this is embedded in an ECU or in it's own package, it's gonna be there.
It's also going to have all the other bits which amount to a cell phone, as the SIM chip itself doesn't actually do any of the things the article is talking about.
It's just a storage device which is used to identify the cellular device it's plugged into.
Whatever the brand name for it is (OnStar, etc.
), that fancy stuff which is supposed to do crash monitoring, or let you use the internet right from your car, it's a cell phone built into the car.
It leaked oil and she failed to mention to me that I need to be constantly checking it and adding more.
I borrowed it while my car was being worked on, for a trip I needed to take back home a couple hundred miles.
We were newly married a few months before and I didnâ€™t know much about cars back then or the quirks of her car since we always used mine when we were together.
Well the trip went fine or so I thought and a few miles from our house it threw a rod.
We ended up selling it to some guy for $400 who was going to restore it.
I like to imagine it has had a good life since then.
My wife still talks about that car all these years later.
It was a nice car.
