Drug overdoses with terminally ill seniors as euthanasia should be taken into account.
I personally know of an old couple in their 80's who took their own lives together this way because they were both terminal but didn't want to spend their days in agony dying slowly.
My buddy had cancer, his doctor prescribed twice the pain meds for three months.
He took a 90 days dosage at once.
Had transferred everything he owned.
His family knew.
This happened in hospital and I have long suspected she was helped on her way but the medical staff.
My grandmother passed away in her sleep in the early 1980s only weeks after being diagnosed with multiple cancers.
I have no proof, but I would thank them if it was true as it saved her months of pain and suffering that was never going to change the final outcome.
If a country or society refuses to have an adult discussion about euthanasia, adults will make their own arrangements when the time has come.
Biological pain responses aren't all cognitive, and whether or not you remember it is not the only factor in whether or not pain has negative effects on a patient.
While some drug deaths among seniors are from accidental misuse of drugs, many are suicides from overdosing on opioids, Kuerbis said.
When all you have to look forward to is more years of pain and the society you live in refuses to even discuss euthanasia, many people take matters into their own hands and this is where you end up.
