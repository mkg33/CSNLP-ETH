My uncle died in the closing weeks of the war hit by German artillery.
We were told that no body was recovered.
It took almost sixty years but I found his grave.
He has been mourned and he has been honored.
I never gave up.
Edit: here's just one instance where what you said was wrong.
One was even used against the others during the Nuremberg trials.
They found my dad's uncle's body in the 90s on a random mountain in Vietnam.
Theory is their military plane couldn't see it.
Doesn't matter.
If you fought for the Germans in WW2 were fighting for the Nazis.
As was seen at the Nuremberg trials, "just following orders" isn't an excuse.
And at the very least, nobody in the German military in WW2 should be seen as a hero unless they started working for the Allies at some point.
It actually does matter, I can tell you know nothing about WW2.
I'd say do your own correct research, but it's clear that isn't going to happen.
It would be like the afghans calling us all republicans when we invaded after 9/11.
"Just following orders".
That's not the same thing.
I never said all Germans were Nazis.
I said that everyone that fought in the army was.
They had a choice.
They could have deserted.
They could have surrendered.
But instead, they chose to fight for the Nazis, regardless of whether or not their enlistment was voluntary.
