The exit polls showed big differences in how people think inflation is effecting them depending on party affiliation.
Other voters aren't immune.
Fact is the media has been emphasizing inflation and falsely tying it to Biden all year, while rarely covering the great parts of the economy like quality job growth.
We could have inflation drop to 0% and most Republicans would still think inflation is high and creating severe burdens for them.
Republicans in particular consistently view economic conditions through a hyper-partisan lens.
The stock market soared under Obama but most Republicans think it either dropped or stayed flat.
Most Republicans think Trump was great on jobs despite weaker growth during his first 3 years compared to Obama's last 3.
Jobs under Biden are outstanding so far.

This is how they operate on all levels.
Crime may be going down but Republicans are fed a daily dose of BS about democrat crime policies run amuck by propagandists, and cops nightly.
People have said crime has gone up every year since the 90s (except 2001) regardless of the fact that crime, especially violent crime is plummeting.
The right-wing constructs separate realities for their followers for everything.
Edit: I simply included this link to reinforce the point made above, that the markets did very well under Obama, despite what Republicans 'remember'.
