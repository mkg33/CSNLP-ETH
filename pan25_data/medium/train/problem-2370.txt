They were sending guys out onto the battlefield with WW1 era rifles only 2 weeks into the campaign.
They had to resort to using Ukraines cell towers for communications because their own just didn’t work.
We really can’t be sure of anything, especially technology actually working or being new.
The nuclear arsenal is (supposed to be) the ultimate deterrent, for every country.
That they're reduced to using their delivery systems in this way shows a level of desperation not many would have considered possible at the start of the year, and is still difficult to comprehend even now.
This also increases the risk of an 'accidental' radiological incident - an incident Russia, and the world, absolutely cannot afford.
You're absolutely correct - a properly constructed nuke has multiple safeguards to prevent an accidental detonation.
However, a regular explosion next to some radiological material would be an absolute nightmare to contain, and would make the orphan source incident in Goiânia look like a walk in the park.
