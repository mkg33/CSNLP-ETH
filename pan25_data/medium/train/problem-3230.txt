If companies would care about having jobs that aren't actually based on giving way too much work out to the employees because having flexible hours means they can force their employees to work unpaid overtime and that are paid well employees would flock there.
People can't move to the cities these companies are looking for workers because they can't afford to live there on the wages that are offered.
Also most companies are unwilling to switch to home office.
Also germany: Cost of living exploding over the last 10 years (especially housing).
Wages stagnating.
Companies raise their prices every year because of inflation but have let the wages stagnate because "Some people in the team work here for 10 years and they still only make the money they got back then so I can't hire new people for more" and then act like them not finding employees is because nowadays people are lazy or demand unreasonable things like not having to work 10-20 hours unpaid overtime a month or expecting more money than the absolute minimum needed to live.
