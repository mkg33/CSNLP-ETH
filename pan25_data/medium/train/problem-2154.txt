Last year I was installing heat pumps and upgrading thermostats to make American homes more energy efficient.
It was kind of odd because as soon as I explained how I heat pump worked most people were just flabbergasted and didn't want them installed anymore.
As soon as they figured out they didn't work on gas they didn't want them.
In all fairness heat pumps really don't work all that well on a massive house with six bedrooms three bathrooms and a basement movie theater...
I have a modest two bedroom home, but a lot of these will to do Americans wanted nothing to do with the heat pump after learning that they would probably have to run it most of the winter in order to keep their large homes and a nice 72° F. They were more worried about their energy bill but then the fact that they would no longer be on natural gas which can get arguably more expensive than electricity during the winter months as demand rises.
> According to Bundesnetzagentur, Germany’s natural gas consumption dropped by 14% in 2022 compared to the average consumption for the past four years.
Industrial demand fell by 15% compared to the average for the past four years.
Between October and December, industrial gas consumption fell by 23%, and consumption by private consumers and businesses was 21% below the previous years.
