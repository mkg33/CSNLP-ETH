The British government has talked tough on the Protocol and made noises about unilaterally altering it but hasnâ€™t actually done anything in reality.
Look at removing air access for EU airspace, see how long this position lasts for, whilst being a teachable moment, had enough of their Brexit, gloves should come off.
No i live near the where they want to put up the border, I recall the army checkpoints / bombs / sectarian violence etc.
You don't fuck around with this stuff, the English brexit ministers didn't even read(they admitted it) the good Friday agreement (Northern Ireland's peace agreement).. it's 24 pages long .. ending decades of violence.
Given that the Majority of people in Northern Ireland support the good Friday agreement and the protocol.
Happily, I think the EU is going to be more pragmatic than that.
Even Leo Varadkar has said that the way the treaty had been implemented is too strict.
The English can shove their new notions where the sun doesn't shine.
As an EU citizen I'm sick and tired of hearing about it.
