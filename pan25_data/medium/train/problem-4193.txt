Of course they are, there's a massive ethnic cleansing campaign underway in E. Jerusalem.
Oh you don't have the right permits from our occupying force that won't give you permits?
There goes your home.
You build a home without a permit in a lot of the US - you have to pay to tear it down.
You also can't build on land where you don't have title to the land.
There is an entire industry built around this basic concept in countries like the US.
About the only major exception I am aware of in the US is in Puerto Rico where the government actually has very lax rules on proof of ownership, permits and such but that is also why so many homes 5 years after 2 major hurricanes are still damaged and ineligible for FEMA funding for repairs - no proof of ownership for the land and the homes weren't built to code or with permits.
Besides, we have an example of the law not being slightly fair to those under its jurisdiction depending on whether or not they're jewish - Nokdim is blatantly illegal since it exists outside of established borders, but is it being torn down?
No, it's expanding.
