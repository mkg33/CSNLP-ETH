COVID wasn't the only problem in recent times.
When Russia and Saudi Arabia had their trade war it dropped prices per barrel into the negative.
This caused multiple shale mining operations and numerous refineries to shut down.
Then, the previous administration went and made a two-year deal with Saudi Arabia to lower production output.
Once that agreement ended, in mid 2022, prices started to fall at a rapid pace up until Russia and Saudia Arabia agreed to lower production again.
Not to mention oil company profits are up significantly due to price gouging.
Biden desperately needs lower oil prices to get reelected, and he can't authorize "drill baby drill" here without pissing off constituents.
So he asked Saudi Arabia to drill more.
They said "only if you exonerate the Prince for the Khashoggi murder" and Biden said "cool, but let's wait until after the midterms".
We shouldn't be.
The sale of vital infrastructure to foreign nations is a national security risk.
Even if they don't use it against us directly, if we ever have to forcefully nationalize a company and seize it from a foreign government, it will impact our ability to trade in the future.
