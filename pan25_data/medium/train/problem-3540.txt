Definitely allowed to pay - while Arizona does regulate the use of paid canvassers to some extend (not all-out prohibition, just more paperwork), it's only for ballot proposition campaigns and not candidate campaigns.
One of the big AZ firms for signature collection, to that point, .
And worth noting that this is 45,000 valid signatures.
As someone who has both collected them and challenged others' validity, the legibility and completeness of these will inevitably be challenged if she's anywhere near the threshold, especially if she ends up paying for them (and I'm unsure what kind of volunteer base she'd field, although that didn't stop Betsy Johnson in Oregon this last cycle).
The typical rule of thumb for candidates here is to add 25% to your minimum required number, and given the specifics of her race it'll be higher for her.
I'd say her campaign will be aiming for something around 55k to start with.
