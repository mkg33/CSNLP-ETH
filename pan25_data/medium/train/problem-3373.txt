Unless the entire world tests for China arrivals, the entire world needs to test for the entire worlds arrivals...
Just a few countries testing for people from China, solves nothing.
Because it will just spread to the countries that don't test, and then from those to the rest anyway.
The UK has 90% vaccination rate, and will do again if needs be.
You can't zero covid the planet, only protect yourself.
The world, the entire world, simply can't stop a pandemic anymore, travel is too easy.
Humans are useless.
You are right about humans being useless.
I'm in an airport in Australia now waiting to board to fly to another country.
Looking around 3 people plus me are masked even though covid is rife here.
Having said that more airport ground staff and crew are wearing masks now than when I flew into Australia 2 weeks ago.
We got lucky that Covid was relatively tame for a possible global pandemic, and for the same reason, are screwed.
the first stupidly deadly one that comes around, wave goodbye to society as we know it.
IF anything, the most deadly thing about covid, was that it just wasn't deadly enough, and now people will be even less likely to react correctly to a very deadly one.
