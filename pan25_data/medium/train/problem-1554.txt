I worked with a guy who was former Special Forces and he told me part of his initial training was being stripped and interrogated by a female soldier.
Well at some point if SERE school they start slamming you into a wall while pouring ice water on you and shit.
So it kind of a question of how rough you like it.
This does nothing to prepare the subject for capture.
This is just bullying with an atom-thin veneer of legitimacy, that only morons would believe.
The soldier who claims he has PTSD from the training and is suing the government claims that he was forced to simulate sex acts with a toy doll and forced to renounce his Christian faith and masturbate over a Bible.
Australia, are you cunts alright?
If you REALLY want to "prepare" combatants for real challenges, start with a course that has no end date.
Put them on a calorie deficient diet.
Make them build useless things under impossible conditions, like runways in Burma, during the monsoon seasons, and if anyone gets lippy, you force them to stare at the sun, while buried up to their neck in sand.
Yeah, put combatants on that regime.
If they quit or die after 3 months, they're not fit for service.
(Essentially, that's some of the things that the Japanese did to POWs).
Suffice to say that you cannot teach "interrogation resistance".
Everyone talks, sooner or later.
