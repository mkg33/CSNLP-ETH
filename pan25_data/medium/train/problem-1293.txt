As an Ohioan, I love the city of Cincinnati, but unfortunately, despite its cultural different making it feel likes it’s not in Ohio, it is.
I’m from Michigan and very pleased we’ve been able to break the GOP stranglehold in our legislature!
I’m hoping for good things and it seems like they’re gonna try.
So I’m keeping a close eye on Michigan and the laws they pass in the next few years.
I won’t be living in Ohio forever regardless lol.
