Yea that is definitely creepy.
I remember stumbling upon those sites now and then that would have random webcams from around the world.
Sometimes they were as you said, warehouses and bridges and whatnot.
However, while webcams and the ability to access them are nothing new, it's one small facet of IOT, which itself is still a pretty new concept.
I'm talking about IOT as a whole, which has many aspects that are currently developing.
Now it feels like the kids grew up but never stopped acting like kids.
The world is running out of proper adults in the room.
We're in an asylum and the inmates are running it.
Of course, nobody thinks it's just a matter of countries trolling each other for the lulz.
It could be surveillance, could be a simple test: "lets get a look at those planes of yours and what they can do..." or a distraction for something else.
I have decent faith that the current administration has some competent people at the controls.
Now, we literally have the world's two largest economies and strongest militaries throwing balloons at each other and screaming about it on social media.
