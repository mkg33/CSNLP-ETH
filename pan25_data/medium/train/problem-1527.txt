It's an interesting position to be in, to be sure.
I understand why the US became a world power in the way that it did, and I don't entirely disagree.
The philosophy of "I have to do it because someone else will otherwise" is compelling, if somewhat dangerous.
It worries me that one nation which, as we've seen recently, is still fragile and capable of great social and political upheaval is in such a position of power.
Right now, that power appears to be in stable, capable hands.
But if that changes, the results could be catastrophic.
Give Trump or someone similar to him another go in the saddle and the power the US wields may be used to cause harm rather than protect against it.
I don't disagree with you, just adding my two cents I guess.
Itâ€™s weird how they try to do the same with US bases.
If the Chinese tried to mess with Guam or Hawaii they would be cut off in the middle of the ocean since they would have to get past Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Australia.
I would include the Philippines but they seem to be getting more China friendly.
