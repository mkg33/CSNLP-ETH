I say give it to them since there is a mechanism to do so apparently, but it would be an interesting precedent for the govt to broker a deal they thought was fair, to then change it at the last moment to benefit one side.
Maybe it makes sense anyway though as the railways are willing to tank the economy over it?
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
