Got a really bad feeling about our Taiwanese friends, we'll need to watch out during April or October 2023.
With Russia and Turkey setting their examples this year, they've paved the way for China (and anyone else) to do the same to Taiwan - use force to seize strategic objectives even if it's a really bad idea.
As will resupplying Taiwan.
The reason Ukraine hasn't fallen is simple - it has a border with Poland.
It goes both ways, being an island makes Taiwan isolated from its allies as well.
Its also a small island, so there isn't depth to trade space for time without losing the cities.
And the Taiwanese haven't done a good job of arming themselves, they don't spend enough and haven't taken enough steps to arm themselves.
It cones down to two questions, does the US fight immediately, and if so how quickly can the US get a huge amount of millitary power into the fight.
from my understanding, the quickest time to mobilize for war in the US is 2 days.
obviously not everything will be there but thatâ€™s the time to get the aircraft carriers out of port.
but, much like the lead up to the Ukraine war, the Chinese buildup leading to any invasion of Taiwan will give the US and other governments sufficient time to get ready and deploy.
