The article says "En tidligere leder" ("A former leader"), not "Den tidligere lederen" ("The former leader").
That is an important distinction.
Here is an auto-translated version of the article:
For anyone wondering, my understanding is that "The" leader implies that he's some head honcho in charge of majority of the Wagner group.
"A" leader is just anyone who had people reporting to them, so any colonel or lieutenant would qualify.
Never said just march them into minefields, that would be a war crime.
I said de-mine the territory they themselves mined.
If they didn't want to clean up their mess, they shouldn't have made it.
Also, Ukraine is well within it's rights to use these prisoners for such labor after the war ends.
(Possibly sooner?
Idk much international law about punitive labor for POWs, but given the history of it even in the West, I imagine it's possible).
Article 32 of the 1929 Geneva POW Convention provides:Â It is forbidden to employ prisoners of war on unhealthy or dangerous work.
Conditions of work shall not be rendered more arduous by disciplinary measures.
Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Geneva, 27 July 1929, Article 32.
