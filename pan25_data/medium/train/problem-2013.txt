I think the likes of McConnell, aka the "old guard" who still understand notions like decorum and appearances, will realize the problems that come from remaining associated with Maga-flavored republicanism.
I'd fully expect the high end of the party to try and distance itself from those positions a fair bit, and try to do so in a way that they retain the support of the crazies...somehow.
Remember when it turns out that Dewey actually lost, how he ginned up a terrorist insurrection with a rigged election excuse to overthrow the government and install himself as dictator?
Somehow the old guards was decimated by the Tea Party, then by MAGA.
I can't believe the survivors won't take a revenge if the opportunity arises.
They too are probably nostalgic of the days when they were respected and could work with the other said of the aisle.
