It's called concentrating solar power.
Also with appropriate investments in transmission, storage, and demand management you can basically solve the problem.
They often boil and intermediate like sodium, which in turn boils water to supercritical temperatures.
Not trying to be pedantic, just think it's kinda cool.
No that doesn't mean we are there yet but it's still good news.
Achieving this milestone means we can now start directing billions more in research towards fusion without the fear that it's all hype.
What we've seen here is the light at the end of the tunnel.
Yeah, they weren't trying to make a reactor, just prove concepts.
Leave the engineering problems to experiments like ITER.
This is more "pure science" through ongoing refinements to an project first started in 1972.
Summed up best as "what happens if we burn stuff with a really big laser?
".
Fun fact: Its this same lab and series of fusion lasers that was filmed for the original Tron movie.
Jeff Bridges would not want to be hit by that laser.
All science builds from previous knowledge and experiments but this is literally the same lab working the same goal for 50 years.
Engineering is totally not my bag but I’d be more than happy to help them reach their goals.
Did they need more coffee?
I have some old white boards in storage too.
What about a nice fish tank in the corner with a betta?
Those science eggheads just gotta holler and we’ll help….
As you should be, its nowhere near useful, but its a proof-of-concept.
The biggest thing that will change here is governments and private investors being less afraid to throw money at it.
A momentum will build as it gets more and more efficient.
We don't have the details worked out but this indicates a good probability that it can be done in our lifetimes.
