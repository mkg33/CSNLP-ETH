I do hope is not a nation with the biggest prison population.
Or countries that keep immigrants in camp or that expell refugees.
The UN Human Rights Council, which comprises 47 member states, is dominated by non-democratic countries, with many accused of severe human rights violations.

It's a very strange apartheid with ministers and generals of all religions.
Interestingly enough it's enemies have pretty well driven out its Jewish and soon Christian citizens.
I also hope that are not nations that decimated cultures and people during their industrial development.
I’m glad that countries that provide housing, food, health and education to all its citizens are being put on the spotlight here.
Don’t want them getting in the way of my freedom here.
What world is this that we cannot simply let people starve?
They even let apartheid states like Israel (not a democracy) in the UN, if you can believe it.
Plus the US super predator state sits on the security council.
