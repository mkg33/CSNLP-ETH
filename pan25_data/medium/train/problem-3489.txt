Poor training likely, and s300s are effective regardless as well as whatever manpads ukraine was operating but my understanding was they held the skies for awhile before ukraine was funneled enough resources to strike them down.
A few months at least.
Yes, they are which is why they are also flying tens of missions per day.
The huge thing here is that the Russian airforce has been brought down to the same level as the Ukrainian.
Which is crazy since the Russian airforce is on paper much stronger.
That's understating it.
The budget for Russia's air force is larger than that for the _entirety_ of the Ukranian military, as in all branches, combined.
And they were supposed to have a 5:1 air advantage.
There's a reason why people where completely flabbergasted at them being unable to achieve air superiority with that overmatch.
As mentioned before, the weapons really only came in weeks after the Feb invasion since everyone was expecting said air force and conventional mismatch to flatten everything and it'd be a guerilla resistance.
Also the West has specifically _not_ been providing any jets, and mostly land stuff the air force should be able to blowup, since that's the point of an air force.
Most of the aid for the recent invasion really only came online after it was clear Ukraine was actually _holding_ since thanks to the numbers above, people were assuming Ukraine was gonna fold like wet tissue paper and the west would have to support guerilla/resistance movements.
for So the aid doesn't really directly affect air force comparisons.
[1] Sure there's been training and modernization since 2014, but that's mostly been training vs any actual equipment and definitely no jets.
