BMW was testing this in car engines wayyyy back when I was a little VW nut.
I'm not an engineer but I think the project didnt work because the infrastructure to install hydrogen pumps...everywhere was too much.
The only problem with hydrogen is that power per volume of fuel is not as powerful as fossil fuels.
So potentially you'd have to make a few extra stops to refill the plane etc but it's still a good start.
Hydrogen is an amazing fuel for many reasons.
But, it is incredibly difficult to make containers to hold it at high pressure safely.
Why?
Hydrogen, being just a single atom molecule, has the amazing ability to slip between the most minute molecular spaces between two surfaces joined to make a container - it can leak out between welds!
So...building safe passenger aircraft for long-haul fast-turnaround high-usage commercial use will prove very tricky, let alone all of the other issues mentioned.
Edit: Oh, and the energy density of Hydrogen is than other fossil fuels, plus when it is burned the only byproducts are water (as steam), so no pollutants.
Not sure where you got your point about it not being as efficient as fossil fuels.
(Edit 2, aah, I now see you meant volumetric density).
Did you see the NASA Artemis rocket launch last week?
It was continually plagued with problems partly because the hydrogen fuel tanks kept developing leaks.
Even within a few hours of the launch they were emergency patching a new leak!
