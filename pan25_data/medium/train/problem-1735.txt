Because of the pogroms of Armenians in Baku and Sumgait, the ethnic Armenian majority of the autonomous oblast of Ngorno-Karabakh asked Moscow to remove the oblast from Azerbaijan SSR.

People often say the west drew borders badly, and they did, out of negligence, but Russia did so maliciously to entice these types of conflicts.
