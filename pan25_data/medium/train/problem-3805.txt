F15 is Boeing’s (originally McDonnell Douglas’s) but it’s still a beast.
100:0 kill ratio (mostly Israel) and we’re basically looking at buying a bunch of modernized version (F15EX) to continue to have a true fighter if needed since F22 is no longer made and F35 does many of the things that made the F22 special in terms of stealth and avionics (but much less capable as a pure fighter).
F15EX would also be cheaper to maintain than the F22/35 which is a big factor.
But honestly it’s just a badass platform and the way it’s been modernized almost deserves a completely different designation than F15 (but the military likes it’s variants).
And the final boss is a huge ass balloon with tentacles that shoot out missiles.
and once you shoot all of them down, you target the balloon itself.
But then when you think its over the balloon deflates and a super hitech jet bursts out and you go for one last annoying dog fight.
Then you go back to that mission to beat it in record time so you unlock said Jet.
