That's half my point.
Most of the global south/east is neutral or aligned with Russia.
This puts China in a very difficult position because going all-in with Russia means hard US trade cuts come sooner not later.
This prevents Xi from returning the economy to normalcy and prevents hardliners from preparing industry for life without US markets, talent and (formal) tech licensing.
China has every reason to maintain neutrality, but this is unsuitable long term as most of the world (outside of the US/Europe) begins trading with Russia, especially when Russia can now offer them prices competitive with China.
This still doesn't help Russia as it diminishes them to a developing third-world country, but for China it is forcing a hard divorce away from the US at least.
Growing up in the late 80's in Arkansas, I can remember when Walmart used to advertise "Made in the USA" all over their store.
Huge banners all over the store.
This is back when Japanese electronics and cars were seen as a big threat.
