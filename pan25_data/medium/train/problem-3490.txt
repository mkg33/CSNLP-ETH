It's one thing to be outmatched in a state that's deep in the other team's color, it's another to willingly shun your formula for success in said state for base politics.
But to do that, and then break the law, and do barely better than your party's Presidential candidate two years prior?
Woof.
As someone who lives in Massachusetts, I don't even know why the GOP tries here at all.
We just lost Baker as governor, one of the very, very few good Republicans, who also happened to be the most popular governor in the US according to opinion polling.
Baker was a one in a million guy, we'll likely never see another Republican who could begin to achieve Baker level fame.
The Republicans have had three popular governors in Massachusetts just since the 1990s in Weld, Romney, and Baker.
If they kept finding Bakers and Welds, they'd always be competitive at least in state executive races.
But the national undercurrent of the Republican Party will always wash it out in exchange for the Fox News Outrage of the Day.
And eventually they hit that critical mass where the primary base will vote like every other Republican primary base in the country, and nominate nothing but kooks for now until the end of time.
