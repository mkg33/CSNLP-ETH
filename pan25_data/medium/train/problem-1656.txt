I’m an Iranian myself, and I seriously doubt that to be true.
Sure, some countries are “trying” to manipulate it, but the war my people are fighting is rooted in Iran, and people are very wise about that.
Russia mave have been proven not to be a true superpower anymore, but I still don't understand why they need the help of a literal third world country to build drones.
On a local level sure, they're a big fish in the middle east.
But they're not on the same level as Russia.
This is a country that competed with the US, was the first to space and the only one with access to it for many years after the space shuttle got discontinued.
That has enough nukes to glass the planet.
For them to need help from Iran is incredibly humiliating.
Sanctions make it harder for Russia to buy ordinary components.
Iran can supply mini-engines, carbon fiber struts, etc.
Russia does the assembly.
Drones have significant software to enable them to reach their target.
Good software, well debugged against edge cases, takes calendar time to develop.
Quicker to buy a proven platform.
