US conservatives have historically held classical liberal ideologies, but at the fringes, some conservative intellectuals are proposing a return to conservative conservatism, ie, ethnostate, monarchy, and traditionalism, ideas which were once unthinkable in the US, a country founded on classically liberal values and whose members hold those values sacred.
Conservatives believe that the cultural order actually will fix the country.
If the culture is right, then everything will be in harmony.
They legitimately see non-conformism as a threat to their project.
You see this when they cite statistics like, "I wonder why crime is so much lower in Japan, is it because 97.5% of the population is ethnically homogeneous?
".
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
