He was probably forced to lie that he had been kidnapped as he was most likely a part of POWs 45 for 45 exchange that happened the same day.
Russian POWs donâ€™t just walk freely on Kyiv streets ready to be kidnapped.
Ukraine has not officially commented this so far, but if he was in fact exchanged against his will (which Zelensky promised would not be happening) after he already stated he wanted to fight against russia - this is a huge mistake on Ukrainian part and will reduce the level of trust and desire to surrender.
The video showed an ex-member of Russia's Wagner group who defected to Ukraine being knocked unconscious and kidnapped from a Kyiv street.
He then woke up in a cellar, where he was tortured and beaten to death with a sledgehammer.
The head of the Wagner group defended the video and called it "a dog's death for a dog".
Give him the same treatment he gave to this man.
They taped his fucking head to a block and crushed it with a sledgehammer.
Fucking barbaric.
You reap what you sow.
