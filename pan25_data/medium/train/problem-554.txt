Then I found the clause that stated the contractual minimum message throughput requirements at full load.
This I hadn't known about.
Doing a little math I found that it would require approximately 7 times the total network capacity.
I immediately set up some tests to see if we could achieve that.
Uh, no, we couldn't, not even close.
Its not petty to expose and oust a bad leader.
Because they work hard to prevent that, usually harder the worse of a leader they are.
IMO when the question is asked "is this guy really a competent leader?"
its usually >(50% of the time) already past the point of moving on.
Because at that point they've probably already been given a second or third chance and/or are already spending more time hiding their inadequacies than actually doing the job properly.
Well this is precisely the problem that will never get solved simply because dictators like Putin do not want competent people, they need people they can manipulate.
Putting competent people in charge of the military might result in those smart people unseating the president, Putin knows this and that's why he prefers dumb, servile men in charge.
