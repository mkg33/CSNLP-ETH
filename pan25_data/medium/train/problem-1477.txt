It's Ross Douthat, a Catholic conservative who likes to present himself as a philosopher and ethicist.
Read the whole thing, and I still have no idea what it has "Done to Canada".
And it would seem to me that anyone who has a maximalist vision of personal liberty, like many conservatives claim to have, would be all on board with going out on their own terms.
This is a policy that secular people from both sides of the political spectrum can get behind, it's only a problem to the Church since it robs them of their biggest-tithing group- old people afraid of suffering.
His biggest fear is that Christianity will peter out with nothing but socialism to replace it, and he tends to see most issues through that lens.
I don't know ...
I look at the places where people tend to be living most happily, and they're low on theology but high on making sure basic needs are met for everyone.
It's like, we know what works, but people like Douthat can't stand the idea that their preferred solution (moar church) isn't it.
