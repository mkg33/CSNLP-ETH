The reason they didn’t, is because they fucked themselves on the other priories of voters.
People worried about Trump, who the GOP sold its soul to in an attempt to cash in on his popularity.
People worried in general about “threats to Democracy,” which the Republicans absolutely sabotaged themselves on by running election deniers, by downplaying or outright supporting 1/6 rioters, and by continuing to claim elections are stolen.
Maybe it’s because I manage a sales territory that covers 1/3 of the country and I’m constantly traveling and talking to regular people in airports and hotels across the country, but the rising anti-Washinon and Liberal backlash in 2016 was almost palpable.
As was the growing disgust toward Trump, and feelings ranging from outrage to disgust to anxiety to fear about the 1/6 riot and subsequent continued election denial.
And that’s without the distrust of the Supreme Court.
I also talked to a lot of Conservatives who were alive in the 80s who still see Russia as an enemy, and who didn’t want to see Trump Republicans pull support for Ukraine.
