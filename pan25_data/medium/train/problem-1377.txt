Bc nobody wants to push ruzzia so hard it will nuke the place.
Better bleed it out slowly until it is dead.
Boling frog kinda thing.
Now, give them a brake.
They need fixed targets that don't run around.
And they need large rockets since the guidance systems is out of scope +/- 1 km accuracy give or take.
Blows my mind that so many countries are giving billions to Ukraine to fix things Russian missiles have hit, but won’t give Ukraine the weapons to hit the bases the missiles are launching from.
Why not take care of the problem.
Russia can cry about it and threaten nukes all they want.
They know it’s justified, they just don’t like it.
Pretty justified to say we are giving Ukraine the weapons to attack inside russsia since Russia is costing the world money.
Edit: yes I know the frog metaphor is bacward, the point IS that a frog jumps out of water as the water gradually heats up (russia get exhausted and pulls out of ukraine as more support for ukraine gradually comes in from the west), and a frog dies if put in boiling water (russia pushes the nuke button if we send all we got at once).
