This definitely doesn't mean Russia is planning anything, but withdrawal from this treaty is really bad news for other reasons.
Russia's petty refusal to engage with the US only increases the chance for mistakes, miscommunications and accidents.
Knowing how many times we've come close to nuclear annihilation due to simple mistakes, this scares me a lot more than any of Putin's nuclear threats.
Honestly, I wouldn't worry that much about it.
As far as I have been able to tell, the inspections side of New START has been suspended since around COVID for obvious reasons.
All New START really does is limit the number of warheads presently in deployment.
Right now both Russia and the US have \1500-1700 or so active duty/deployed warheads, with some additional 3k?
ish in reserves.
Russia has a little more in reserve than we do.
That's all to say that a lot of the first strike projections put the range into a 500 -1000 warhead exchange would be world-ending.
What difference does an extra 2 or 3k extra warheads that neither side might not even manage to launch?
All that, also, to point out that no one wants a Nuclear exchange.
There is a lot of bluster and big-game boasting.
But it's all fear-mongering nonsense.
I would not lose sleep over it.
