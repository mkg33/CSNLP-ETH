Slamming, blasting, destroying, eviscerating, and skullfucking have been going on for a long time.
I remember Jon Stewart making fun of news outlets for doing this sometime in the 2000s.
I think it's fitting.
The whole Trump campaign started in 2015 and I think that was the start of more primitive discourse, twitterization if you will.
Sure we don’t have news boys hawking the headlines now, but they were always really more advertising than editorial.
Editorial integrity is a pretty recent construct.
Even now, papers like the New York Post are more tabloid, than say the Washinon Post.
We do.
It’s still an imperfect system.
Most news agencies do have a code of ethics for journalistic integrity.
It’s probably one of the reasons they PBS is generally pretty good.
They are not beholden to their advertising budgets.
Will mistakes be made?
Sure.
Sources will be improperly vetted.
Sources will lie .
But for the most part, the millions of news stories a year are written and reported in a pretty ethical manner.
Heck yeah.
Improvements have been made, but headlines like these are an example of how we can improve even further.
The problem is that news outlets must encourage their writers to make up headlines like this to make it seem like more of a story than it actually is.
Their data shows more people click if they use words like 'slams' and 'blasts' than if they said 'criticizes.'
Yeah, the latter is way more accurate but doesn't captivate the audience who hasn't seen those other words 1000 times only for it to be a big nothing burger.
These people should be ashamed of themselves, but they only care about money and this makes them more of it.
