A federal court judge said they had to do it, not that the government is doing it.
Let alone will do it.
I didn't ignore anything why are you acting like I did?
That was a opinion not a fact!
Where did I say the ruling was wrong?
Right I didn't I said it didn't like it and it's insane that it can happen.
Thereâ€™s a big difference as the judgement can be appealed and, in any case, is possibly an unconstitutional order by the judge.
SCC - R v Hape (2007) had a different opinion, so this decision is on shaky ground already.
I think those relatives should be deported and lose there citizenship, seriously wtf!
The article really doesn't explain why the judge ruled for them because the fact they did is completely insane.
"relatives took the Canadian government to court and argued that preventing them from entering Canada would violate their constitutional rights.
".
Sure, it's your home.
It's their home too.
They're Canadian.
You can't deport people just because you don't like them.
Remember the truck protests and violence that happened last year?
Do you call for the government to deport the truckers and their families?
Or do you support deporting the families of "proud boys"?
I also said I don't know why the judge specifically made this ruling, so I clearly didn't ignore anything.
Idk why you need to lie about what I said it was clearly I was specifically talking about families supporting terrorists.
If a family supports a terrorist they should be punished for it That's what I said Terrorist aren't good people and shouldn't be supported, and if someone supports them odds are they're not far behind in their ideas.
