As far as Trump and other right wing politicians across the West, I doubt that most would eliminate support if they gain power.
If for no other reason than the fact that the American military industrial complex is a massive Republican donor and is salivating at the prospect of a new war to fund.
It would certainly be far worse for Trump to be in power as I'm sure he'd find some way to fuck it up, but I'd doubt even he would stop shipping arms to Ukraine.
I'd agree that he probably wouldn't have supported Ukraine in the first place, but now that we are I don't think he'd stop it.
Plus the electorate has rejected Trump and his cohort for the last three elections.
It is not likely he'd win.
Sure they do.
Russian fossil fuels are selling for pennies on the dollar, so sanctions have significantly cut into Russia's profit and thus their ability to fund the war.
Or the profiteering off the death of Ukrainians.
The sanctions are meant to slow or stop Russia monetarily In the war.
I guess indian does not give a shit.
As long as India pays below market rate for Russian oil, it's fine.
The Ukrainians need more tanks, more rockets, more AA (like F-16 or Patriot), and long range strike capability.
They don't need India to stop buying oil.
US and European politicians get to claim they're cutting out Russian gas without dealing with massive price spikes.
