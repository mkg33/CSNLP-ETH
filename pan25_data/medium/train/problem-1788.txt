Honestly I don’t understand this take, the Chinese uses western tech all the time be it Iphone to medication.
It’s not like they never use western medicine before.
I legitimately don’t understand why he chose this hill to die on.
And today, they basically have reached the point of no return.
Of course China has the power to switch to Fosun-Biontech (this is how they call Pfizer).
They have the license, and as we can see in Hong Kong they also have the technology to actually produce it.
And I am sure they could also buy from the west.
So if they really want, within months, maybe within half a year, most of the Chinese population is vaccinated and they could end all their Covid lockdowns.
And then what?
It would be very obvious that China could have done this years ago.
All the agony in the past years was just a matter of Xi's pride.
Everyone would see this.
This is not an option anymore.
It is too late.
The only option Xi has left is acting like there is no alternative to the current situation.
If he could start all over, it would be very easy: The Chinese pharma company Fosun invested very early in Biontech and signed deals with Biontech, similar to Pfizer, allowing them to sell it in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong.
The US had no problem to act like Pfizer is an American vaccine.
China could have called it Fosun and do the same.
In Hong Kong Fosun actually sold the Fosun Biontech vaccine.
But only in Hong Kong.
It worked, of course.
But not for the rest of China.
Why?
