Poland is currently governed by the PiS, which is a pretty conventional far right conservative party.
The party this article is about is the "Confederation Liberty and Independence", which is a different far-right party that currently is a tiny minority in parliament and has ideas like restoring a monarchy.
They use state television for their propaganda in which they say that Donald Tusk (ex PM and leader of oposition) is a traitor who sold Poland to Germany and colaborates with Germans and the EU so they can slowly take over Poland.
They also say that Germany is pulling strings in the EU and that they will do everything they can to make 'Germany the gratest nation in EU'.
It's sick, but apparently it works because they won previous elections and it's like the freaking Texas here in Poland.
Ah sorry, it's the same propaganda.
They want to use some of it because PiS already did the brainwashing and Konfederacja is another right wing party who is tring to replace PiS by playing even more tough and nationalistic.
