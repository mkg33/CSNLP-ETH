One day, and God Forbid this ever happens, a missile is going to accidentally hit something because Senor Kim is aiming close to a country to show off and the targeting system makes an error.
God Help NK when/if that happens.
Neither japan nor korea are in nato.
They would like to be, but they arent.
Also it would have to change its name.
Should have done that when turkey joined, but still.
Doesn't the US have an agreement with Japan to come to their aid if they're ever threatened?
They agreed to that in exchange for japan not developing its own military or nuclear weapons.
Japan, South Korea, America, (maybe Australia) all roflstomp North Korea.
China can join in as well.
In fact, we make an agreement with China that after the roflstomping we'll keep the DMZ where it is so they can still have a buffer.
No one actually knows, and I assume not since if he's firing them into the ocean then it's just a waste of plutonium and the like.
But it may not matter, if, again God Forbid, the missile hits a populated area, it will still do a ton of damage AND may take lives just from the sheer mass and velocity of the missile otself.
China and SK may not want a refugee crisis, but even SK doesnt like having Artillery and Missiles aimed at Seoul.
Even if they do nothing, the US is itching to kick NK's shit, and Japan also wants some skin too, Hell US on their own would probably do it, even with China's final warnings.
Again though this rests on something catastrophic happening, and I hope that never happens.
