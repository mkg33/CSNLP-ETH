Most of Desantis's popularity in Florida comes from the fact that he closed businesses for the fewest amount of days of any governor in America, causing a bunch MAGidiots to roll into the state and vote for him.
He has no real charisma and the dude he ran against was a horrible former governor whose regime failed Florida insurers and insurance consumers last go around.
I am not sure that will translate to the rest of America.
