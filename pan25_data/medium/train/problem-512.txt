It's a ridiculous oversimplification for candidates to simply win by having a "message" to those voters.
Are Democrats at a disadvantage in Utah in general elections because they are not delivering the right message?
Of course not, the voters are predisposed to be against any message a Democrat would offer and their candidates.
The Dems would have to change who they Just like voters in SC are going to have predispositions.
This is almost nonsensical.
This is worse than Iowa depending on who you support.
South Carolina Democrats are relatively conservative and pro-establishment.
Iowa had a tendency to give a shot to new candidates and new ideas.
SC will shut that shit down.
Which I suspect is the point.
If diversity was important Nevada is a far more diverse early state than SC.
It's a problem either way...
Voters are different in each state.
For example voters in SC are going to be less open to lgbt rights than say voters in NH.
Campaigning is helpful but doesn't make the electorate magically change.
My statement still stands: getting voter support in SC is only a problem for candidates who can't bring a message to those voters.
