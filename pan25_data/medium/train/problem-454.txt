Battletoads repelling level or The Lion King monkey toss level.
You come out alive through that and no one questions your skill or determination to live.
> The good news is that we are halfway to making a true NerveGear The bad news is that so far, I have only figured out the half that kills you.
The perfect-VR half of the equation is still many years out.
What happened in step two?
All the science fiction books Iâ€™ve read about this had a back story before it started killing people.
I've thought about this with racing games, specifically.
Or like dirt rally.
Where you have some kind of really kind of physically unpleasant experience when you crash.
Not that you would actually be physically injured, but just some sort of loud jump scare type feeling, or something sensory that you really don't want to happen.
Maybe some little low wattage electrocution, or you have multiple connection points on your body that get struck with a small electric shock?
I don't know, and I don't even know how you would physically go about doing that.
But it is interesting to think about, especially if it's completely consensual and people playing games wanted it to happen to them, to increase the realism at the game.
