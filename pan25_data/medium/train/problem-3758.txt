When I was Christian, at one point I randomly called out to the being that created everything, including heaven, and loves us all (instead of my usual prayer to who I considered God).
They are definitely different beings.
And you can’t accurately personify the real one.
It’s like a bacteria trying to understand us in terms of bacteria- it would extremely water humanity down, and put us in a very limited box.
We feel emotions and thoughts completely different, yet they think they understand “god” while still craving demonic control.
also, Rapper SamanYasin's death sentence could be carried out anytime soon as he has been moved from Evin Prison to Raja'i Shahr Prison.
He's charged with "enmity against God" for supporting the Iranprotests & singing about injustice.
Surely, if someone was actually guilty of ‘enmity against God’, God doesn’t need anyone’s help smiting the guy.
The fact that he hasn’t been struck down by a lightning bolt seems like it should be a pretty adequate defense against the charge (if they weren’t obviously brought in bad-faith).
