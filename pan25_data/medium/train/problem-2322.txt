I dont know if their goals are achievable but I do know that no matter what Russia lost.
Its an epic defeat on many levels, political, social, economic and diplomatic.
It will take decades to repair the damage.
As much as I want Ukraine to win statements from Kyiv need to be taken with a grain of salt.
Iâ€™m still skeptical of a total Ukrainian victory happening anytime soon.
I still think the number 1 way for Ukraine to get their country back soon is for something to change in the Russian govt.
Of course it's a no-brainer that the easiest way of winning the war would be if Russia decided to just get the fuck out.
But if you look at the whole development of this conflict Ukraine has achieved the unthinkable time and time again and has a pretty strong base for further liberations right now.
They stopped the early mechanized capital rush by Russia with a lightning fast mobilization and smart use of anti-tank weapons.
They stopped the land grab in the South and East and stabilized those fronts after Russia's surprise momentum.
They forced the invaders to retreat from Kyiv region.
They liberated Kharkiv and captured tons and tons of Russian equipment.
They liberated Kherson region by strategically cutting supply lines.
Ukraine has been very smart in this war and I do think we can expect the liberation of the Melitopol area and a push towards Crimea soon.
Of course Russia is trying their best to stabilize their fronts and fortify their gains.
I don't think it will help in the end.
They can push on Bakhmut but it will only be a huge meat grinder for them.
