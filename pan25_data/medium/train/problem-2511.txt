Kinda weird thing for Wyoming to do, I always imagined Wyoming was full of them prepper types, and everybody knows that after the zombie apocalypse, some solar panels and a Rivian are going to be a much better idea than a coal-rolling F-250 diesel in terms of being able to keep in operation.
I'm a survivalist (prepper type) and I can tell you that the invention of solar, wind, water, power generators is a god send.
If a prepper is against any form of individual ways of generating power then they care more about politics than they do survival.
