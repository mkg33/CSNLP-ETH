Many of their reactors are getting old.
Approximately 40 years.
The maintenance requirements are getting more and more cumbersome.
I believe a few have been found with minor corrosion, but the issue is they don't know what caused the corrosion and won't fire them back up until they do and can take appropriate action against it.
The vast majority of the US nuclear power plants are 50-60 years old and they are still humming along providing 20% of the total US electricity.
It sounds more like the French got behind on their maintenance schedules and never caught up.
Or they used designs that were simply not robust.
Keep an eye on Nuscale.
They may have a real solution to these issues on their hands, but they are not yet operational.
They've cleared the US DOE regulatory hurdles, which is not a small feat.
It's a biased comparison.
The graph shows the availability in days, the average french reactor is much more available than all wind farms of the world in hours over the year.
Moreover in 2018 France produced much more electricity than it consumed, meaning there was no constraints on reducing the delays for planned unavailability.
