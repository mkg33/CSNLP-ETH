Their voters never find out.
I started checking Fox News's website most days for a few minutes back at the height of BLM/Pandemic and still do.
They live in a false news chamber.
It's basically the National Enquirer for liberal blame.
They just throw abusive headline after abusive headline.
Find a Firefighter that doesnt like Biden?
Get a quote and create a headline "Arizona firefighters blast Biden over immigration policy".
Doesn't matter that the firefighter couldn't name any policy of Biden's, he watches Fox and knows Biden and liberals are to blame for the open border because they just want the free votes.
Which Fox also tells them is happening because a few towns in California decided to let locals vote in local elections if they owned property there whether they were citizens or not.
That gets taken out of context so that illegals are voting in our elections state/federal elections when they're not.
Over and over.....
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
