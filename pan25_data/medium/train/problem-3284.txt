They got what they deserve, IDF has something called "Ruah Za'hal" it's a sort of Spirit of the IDF where it states how as an Israeli soldier you're expected to act, you're told to follow it during bootcamp and to ignore illegal orders such as attacking or beating unarmed people.
These guys are not fit to be in the military, but since Israel has conscription laws, sometimes power hungry people who get high on having "power" get through and join combat units/military police/border units and end up harming people they get in contact with constantly.
Ruah Za'hal says these guys need automatic court marshals and to spend the remainder of their service in a jail cell.
Disgusting that they purposefully put these arsim into magav and police units by the droves - all of Jerusalem/West Bank you can see it.
And like you said, some arsim can be devious, power hungry psychos.
The same person who'd stab you in a bar fight is donning that border patrol/police uniform.
What an absolute shameful situation in Israel, the government should be ashamed of itself.
The saddest part is there's plenty of these despicable people rising in the ranks.
It takes a certain type of person to choose to become a combat soldier especially in more stressfull and generally more frequently hostile rolls as magav.
You need to be willing to put your life on the line for the sake of the state as well as being physically fit and more mentally tough than the average person which means that most combat soldier are amazing well disciplined people but arsim can get through.
