What is funny sometimes is when 2 rival groups don't agree on who controls which area so they can still burn your construction site even when you pay protection.
The average cost for a "protection" for a single site is around 3000$ a month, depends on many factors though.
The court is very lenient, you can get around 7 years for killing someone, and it is one of the only ways to actually serve time, unless your case is mega famous.
If it’s so well known why doesn’t the government do something about it?
I don’t know anything about this but paying protection in such a rich and prosperous nation seems crazy to me.
Someone(Bedoui btw) broke into a house, raped a 10 year old girl in her own bed in her own house, he was supposed to get around 3 years in jail, it got bumped to 5 years since the case got very public.
It wasn't always like that but in the recent years the violence rose a lot, not enough cops and nobody wants to be a cop, and the cops don't even bother too much with arresting people since the court will dismiss the cases anyway.
Let’s be honest, nobody prosecutes every criminal.
It’s simply not possible.
But he’s kudos to israel for not being afraid of going after the most powerful people at least some of the time.
