Polically messy.
But damn, that's some lethal hardware to be facing if you're Russian..
I don't know if they've got much left that could be a threat to a Chally 2, other than f out of the way.
The only downside to those is I heard the rifle barrel wears out a slightly quicker than the smoothbore ones, and it complicates logistics a bit since it's non standard rifled 120mm ammo.
But, seriously those things will turn Russian armor to mush.
It’s a very quick and efficient system designed for destroying targets as quickly as possible at ranges over 3km against hordes of Soviet tanks.
Challenger has a quite advanced Hunter Killer system, where the commander independently identifies and saves targets, the computer slaves the gun to these as priorities by the commander, all the time the gunner and loader are laying the gun as the computer moves the gun to bear.
The U.K. still can produce the ammo for these guns but since it’s only 10 they are talking about existing stockpiles would suffice.
It is good option because not all of British Challengers are going to be modernised (148 out of 227) so the rest could go to Ukraine (it is 79 tanks which is enough for 2 Ukrainian tank battalions) + Brits are getting rid of rifled guns from Challengers during modernisation so almost all of amunition could be given to Ukraine.
I agree that Leopard will be better option but when you don't have what you like, you like what you have - we just can't wait for Germans any longer.
