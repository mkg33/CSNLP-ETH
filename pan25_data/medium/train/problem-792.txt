You are confusing labor with capital.
Capitalism is the evolution of feudalism in that it allows the rich to own the wealth that our labor produces without requiring that shareholders do any of the work themselves.
"It is assumed that labor is available only in connection with capital; that nobody labors unless somebody else, owning capital, somehow by the use of it induces him to labor......Labor is prior to and independent of capital.
Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed.
Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration -Abe Lincoln , First Annual Message to the Senate and House of Representatives.
The bottom line is that when you retire, you start to cost society more than you contribute.
And many countries now have ageing populations.
And again, that’s not to speak ill of anyone who is retired or insist that increasing the retirement age is a good thing or the best course.
It’s just a difficult situation.
This is also why immigrants are very good for a country, they buff the working age population, and help alleviate these stresses.
Additionally, poor people are more likely to retire younger due to poorer health as they age.
Which is the inverse of what you implied.
To be clear, this isn’t their “fault”.
And I hate the idea of making elderly individuals work for longer, especially in manual and industrial jobs.
But I’m just trying to set the record so people can have a more informed discussion about the issue instead of brigading what looks on the surface like a simple social injustice.
However, this is a real problem that many developed nations are facing and it’s only going to get to worse.
I know we like to shit on the government and “rich people” as if they’re doing this out of some sadistic intention.
But that narrative is patently false.
They’re doing it because they have very limited options and ideas on how to tackle a pretty insidious and worsening societal consequence of the excellence of modern healthcare.
Europe and the US would both have much worse issues than they do (although the US isn't too bad) if it weren't for immigration.
At least countries like France have this option.
Russia and China have let their demographic problem get so out of control they are, essentially, fucked.
There should be a greater effort made to help people understand the value of immigration.
The tired stereotype of immigrants “stealing our” jobs is antithetical to the truth.
They stimulate and support the economy.
Because how many times do we see similar outrage over immigration?
It’s slightly aggravating to see people protest against something that they practically need, but just don’t know that they need it.
It’s fine to think that raising the retirement age isn’t the way forward.
It does have it’s issues.
But it’s as if any efforts made by government to address the problem will be met by protest.
If it’s not raising the retirement age, but rather we’re accepting more immigrants, then people will protest that instead.
And if they get their way, when they suffer the inevitable consequences, they will protest then as well.
People do not place enough importance on questioning why something is changing.
There is merit.
But no one wants to see it nor accept it.
No.
The world is facing a fundamental issue symptomatic of people living longer.
Retired people impose huge pressures on society as their demographic grows from living longer while becoming economically inactive for longer.
Most of this strain is imposed upon working age people.
And the effects are so macroeconomic and far reaching that there are too many to condense into a single comment.
Well what can you say if govt allows more immigration but does not allow infrastructure to be built to accommodate that wave.
Check out Canada as the example ...they are thinking of bringing in 500k immigrants but there is no system in place for housing , healthcare and all.
This in turn causing the whole COL to shot up and QOL down.
When this happen , folks gonna hate Govt and immigration plans.
Its the same here in Canada.
I also understand their objections too.
You can't just turn the nature into concrete jungle...where will anybody go to experience nature then.
It is a catch 22 situation.
This is very tangential, and not a robust one at all.
But here in the UK, housing, infrastructure projects are constantly obstructed by locals protesting the move.
With the desire to protect the land, the countryside, the view.
Every blade of grass must be preserved and it’s absolutely insane.
We can’t live in a natural wilderness utopia and expect to maintain the quality of life we’ve come to expect.
And people my age are feeling the effects.
This is pure conjecture on my part though.
But this specific scenario just infuriates me.
Let them build the houses, we fucking need it more than you need a field in your backyard to walk your dog in.
Exactly ...I am not against immigration ...but there has to be a quote / limit to allow ppl in.
Plus Infrastructure need to prop up to accommodate that which is not happening and putting strain on already stressed out Canadians living here.
so why has wages not moving up ...why living situation is getting worse ?
Why rent is so high ...housing so high ....so much wait at the hospital ?
Canada need tax payer who pay high tax but don't demand anything in return.
I agree, and I think the obvious solution is to make legal immigration much quicker and easier.
The time it takes to immigrate to the US legally is ridiculous.
If only it were so simple.
“Just throw money at the problem.” Sadly, the mechanisms at play here are vastly more complex than that.
And many of the problems compound upon each other.
It’s not just about money, although that is an important factor.
It helps.
But it doesn’t solve other problems.
Retirees calcify certain segments of markets.
They hold assets, which sustains value but has very limited effect in actually stimulating the economy.
Like real estate.
Though this is still talking about money, just in a more nebulous sense.
I can’t say I appreciate your sarcastic shot across the bow when it is so witless that it reduces a field people spend years studying, into a single sentence solution.
Maybe a better example would be the employment deficit it creates.
As more people exit work and impose demands on the care sector, you need more carers and medical professionals.
But population growth is slowing.
You still need workers of every sector to provide services to the elderly.
You still need utility workers to keep them heated.
You need more.
More of everyone.
And it’s simply unsustainable.
It seems very few people understand these macroeconomic problems.
It’s shocking how you get downvoted for simply stating cold facts.
And like I said in another comment.
The problems compound upon each other.
People have less children when housing remains prohibitively expensive and younger people are unable support larger families.
You need more workers to build them.
It’s a negative feedback loop.
Money is one resource, but the resource that’s even more critical than money is people themselves.
Those two resources cannot be separated anyway.
They are symbiotic.
