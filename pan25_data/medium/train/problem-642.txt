Good question actually, I was reading the news yesterday and got the idea in my head that the death, four cases and 8 contacts was in Singapore so today I glossed right over this being in Cambodia.
Yeah, it's a little more concerning that this is happening in Cambodia.
Just sell those restaurant styled toilet paper.
Then that issue won't happen again.
Or buy a bidet attachment for your toilet.
I'm amazed it didn't catch on during lockdown with toilet paper shortage.
Not yet.
They probably got it from the same place, rather than her giving it to him since we have no reason to believe itâ€™s capable of transmitting from one person to another.
Not yet, at least.
Maybe a little panic?
Even if its Human to Human there's no reason to panic \yet\.
The most important thing about a contagious disease is its r0, which is how contagious it is.
r0 has interesting mathematical properties, in that if its below 1, then it can form small pockets but burn itself out.
And by small pockets, I would expect only a few people.
Edit: Not four cases of bird flu, four cases of flu like symptoms in 8 contacts.
This article updates it to 1 cade and 11 additional contacts.
Don't mind me people, my brain is melting today.
