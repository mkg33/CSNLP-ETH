And Putin still believes he can defeat these people?
He's expending so much for what will always be temporary victories.
The people he's murdered will never be returned to their families, but everything else will be rebuilt.
The crazy fucker just can't accept it.
The Ukrainians are stronger and more capable than his hollow house of lies.
It's a fact.
They may lose but they will claim their pound of flesh!
Even if it cost them a lot more.
There is no rationale, it is just pure revenge.
You, and broadly speaking - the West, have to understand one thing about Russian rulers, starting with Ivanushka the Terrible.
Putin knows Ukraine will never join Russia and now he is making them to pay the price.
They have to suffer, be punished, be devastated.
But now he knows he will most lokely lose.
That's why he is lashing out on revenge, making Ukraine pay for their independence.
This is precisely why I don't think sanctions should be lifted even after Russia fully withdraws from Ukraine.
We simply can't let them walk away from this unpunished, decades of isolation, hunger, and poverty is in order.
