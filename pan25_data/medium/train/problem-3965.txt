You might get away with driving them out of Ukraine, but the moment American tanks are rushing down Russian soil?
Game over.
hahah our weapons were purpose made for this war.
For the last 78 years the villains in our games and movies have either been Russian or Nazis.
we're prepared..
Can you imagine Putin actually being ok with this a day before his big speech?
I would assume Putin is a bit upset down there in his bunker .
I took that in context of they wouldn't be launching drones or missiles into Kyiv while Biden was there.
What a colossal fuck up it would be for a stray missile to take out the President of the US.
Putin: WHY'RE 11 AMERICAN CARRIER BATTLE GROUPS SORTIEING FOR THE MED.
AND BARENETS SEA???
What do you MEAN none of our subs have given us a status report in 72 hours??
Why is AC/DC's Thunderstruck playing on all our radios and TVS?
Probably but we're never gonna know.
There's a line of succession if government officials get killed but the military's response if a foreign nation kills a US president isn't known.
Generally though kill foreign heads of state is how wars start.. (For example WW1 with the death of the Arch-duke).
It'd like be possibly to kill Putin with 24 hours of that incident though and then see what the Russians do in response.
