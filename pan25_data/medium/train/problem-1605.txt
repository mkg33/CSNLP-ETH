For as much theater as Iran and Israel’s right wing display, they are both the boogeyman the other needs for legitimacy.
I think it would be hard to argue that foreign policy isn’t the wedge issue that keeps the Israeli right wing in power.
It really isn't.
In terms of foreign policy, Israel's center-left governments were consistently better performing, and that includes Iran as a threat.
In case you're not following, Israel's right wing parties' PR is dominantly focused on internal security, with 2nd place being playing on the feelings of the poor.
Israel and Russia are not friends, more like "we're enemies, but we have other things to focus on".
Unlike Europe-Russia dynamics, there are many factors at play that decide how Israel-Russia relations progress.
For both, it's impossible to just shut everything off and say "we're done talking".
Europe can certainly afford such an approach.
Think of it as a more complex version of US-China relations.
Both are actively taking military actions against one another, but trade continues.
Russia's and Iran's mutual arms deals plus Israel's aid to Ukraine are definitely putting a strain on Israeli-Russian relations, but it would take a lot more than that to sever their ties.
This is the exact dynamic to keep in mind for Israel-Russia relations.
They're too deeply died on security issues to cut all ties, but they do not like one another.
