Xi needs Ukraine intact for any hope to make their silk road 2.0 work.
If Russia takes it over then they're forced to constantly deal with Russia who will no doubt want intolerable rents and kill any hope of a real open trade with Europe directly.
China already made a defensive military pact with Ukraine years ago if they were to come under nuclear attack.
The question is quite like other countries had with CSTO and Russia whether their word - their soft power - converts to real power when it comes down to it.
China has just watched Russia and Putin lose all face within the eastern countries, you cannot maintain soft power when your pacts promise hard power and you fail to deliver you become a joke.
China deals almost exclusively in soft power with the vail of hard power promises distant in the background.
They cannot let themselves be grouped into bag with Russia.

He was defaced in Kazakhstan 3 weeks ago.
