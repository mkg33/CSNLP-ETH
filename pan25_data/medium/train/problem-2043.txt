I'll have to read the full report but this feels like a headline intended to mislead and stir up anger where it doesn't belong.
If it were execution by firing squad it'd be worth military tribunal.
If some kids were indoctrinated and given weapons to kill soldiers, there's not a lot you can do about that.
Those soldiers are better off alive.
Russians have raped and killed thousands of children in Ukraine.
I'm certain they've done the same in Syria and Afghanistan too, and those kids absolutely were not child soldiers, they were just unfortunate enough to be born near Russia.
>Even the lower number is four times more than previously thought, since prior documents released by the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence (MOD) had only revealed 16 confirmed child fatalities.
Russia’s done 10x this in 8 months…..crazy when one military is trained not to commit atrocities and the other uses as a tool to terrorize civilians into doing what they want.
It’s a good thing those kids were killed to prevent the Taliban from ever regaining control, it would really suck if america killed children only for the taliban to come back!
