Democrats: "Hey everyone, look at these studies that show a correlation between homes with gas ovens and kids with more asthma and health problems.
Maybe we should look into better regulations to use them safely and move away from them in new construction by utilizing options like electric and induction.
".
I was listening to the local classic rock station the other day and the hosts took a break to talk about what's in the headlines for the day.
They decided to start talking about how the democrats are taking your gas stoves.
One of the co-hosts tried to at least seem reasonable, explaining the reasoning behind the concern and the link to asthma and all that, but the other co-host was fucking mental.
The whole time he's just like "Why are people voting for more rules?"
and "How are they gonna make everyone replace their gas stoves?"
and what really sent me was "You heard it here first: gas stoves cause aids!"
It's exactly the level of aggression and critical thinking you'd expect from someone who was poisoned by lead in their youth.
