It's not use, it's fulfillment.
Don't tell me you don't have dreams of Leopards waltzing over the Russian positions with 40kmph shooting left and right till they reach the sea of Azov and over the Crimean steppe.
The issue with them is that either their tanks are by and large low quality.or they use them by themselves without proper infantry support.
A smaller number of tanks .
Ifvs and infantry combined .
Can defeat a larger force if its just tanks with not enough infantry.
Oddly enough the country using human wave tactics isn't using enough troops when it comes to using their tanks.
Perun did a talk on this.
Russian doctrine is to fill out infantry squads with conscripts but until they annexed the territory they couldnt technically use the conscripts… so they didnt.
Which meant all those top tier russian divisions went in with a critical shortage of grunts to do grunt work.
The thought is Kyviv would fall so fast from blitzkrieg that conscripts werent necessary.
Turns out they were.
All those top tier russian units got the fuck mauled out of them and that spear tip became blunt af.
To be fair putin didnt have a good option.
If he mobilized the conscripts the whole world would know what he was up to.
So he went for the surprise zerg rush but failed horrible and blunted a huge amount of his combat force in the process.
You gotta train those dudes to effectively support said armor elements.
Russia don’t like training dudes anymore.
Russia/USSR quite simply does not have the same attitude towards combine arms tactics as western powers.
The west severely (and thank fuck they did) overestimated capability for decades based upon inventory.
That inventory also being dilapidated/troops undertrained is really just icing on the shit cake.
Hence the snark.
Not tanks - but look what happened to the VDV.
Russia has no idea how to get with the modern state of warfare.
