"Proposition 26, backed by dozens of California's Native American tribal governments, would legalize sports betting at tribal casinos, while allowing them to offer craps and roulette.
The measure was fiercely opposed by operators of cardrooms, who worry about a provision that would allow individuals to bring civil lawsuits against card clubs over disputes in state gaming law – essentially enshrining a lessening of tribal sovereignty into California law.

Not really, the bills themselves were just not realistic.
Too much money leaving state and amending constitution of state.
If they bring forth an actual legitimate motion, it will pass IMO, but I also think it’s better they go legislation route to legalize it than voting measure.
Regardless, we could've used the money to start tackling the homelessness issue.
Now I have to continue to listen to everyone bitching on nextdoor that California is doing nothing about it.
