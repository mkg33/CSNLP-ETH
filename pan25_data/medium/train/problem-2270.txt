IMHO Congress should give the President statutory authority to raise the vehicle mile-per-gallon efficiency standards as a way to give the executive branch better leverage.
If the president raises those standards by 1 MPG over a ten year window the international markets punish Saudi investment funds to the tune of a billion dollars or so.
That’s fair enough but you could do other things to kick MBS in the teeth.
Like not arming Saudi Arabia or using the US military for security in defense of a regime with a horrendous human rights record.
Give the president authority to inch those up every time the Saudis bomb a village or murder a journalist or manipulate global oil supply or suppress a protest, etc etc.
You’ll see them start to get very responsive very quickly.
