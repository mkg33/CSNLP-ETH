Also, Trump acts like he’s not interested in getting back on Twitter, but you and I both know he won’t be able to resist an opportunity to pontificate without interruption.
But in the other hand, Trump being unable to lay off Twitter is one of the reasons his dumbass lost in 2019.
He WILL take shots at EVERYONE, particularly in the Republican Party, likely exacerbating whatever internal dissensions they’re feeling.
It’ll suck for him, McConnell, the GOP at large, and ESPECIALLY Ron DeSantis.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
It’s a weird situation, if nothing else.
On the one hand, Trump is an actual garbage person who should be in prison for his multiple crimes.
It’s likely he’ll rile up his angry, potentially violent base and push them to act.
On the OTHER-OTHER HAND, this all may be a moot point in the end.
It’s only been 2 weeks since Elon Musk took over Twitter and what was once a social media staple is now just limping along.
I kind of doubt Twitter will even exist long enough for Trump to do anything more than piss us off that he’s even been given his platform back.
