As someone who grew up in a very rural part of America, they (those living in the rural areas) just do not care about problems outside the bubble they live in.
Seriously.
They want to same job and life as their grandfather, which means they work in mining or industrial industries.
Where I grew up it was coal mining.
When you talk climate change, they do not see disaster, food crisis, water crisis, or even people being displaced.
They hear "coal bad" and then fight it because they think "coal good" because it what their family has always done.
You don't have to convince rural conservatives that climate change is real, you just have to convince them that solutions to climate change are in their best financial interest.
Do liberals suddenly not shop at Walmart anymore?
Drive gas-powered automobiles or fly in airplanes?
Use cellphones with rare metals in them?
Eat foods harvested and ranched on lands laid waste for the sake of agriculture?
Heat their homes in the winter and cool them in the summers?
Use electricity?
