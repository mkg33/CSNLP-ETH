Yeah still doesn’t make sense, you really think a world with 2 billion people polluted more than a world with 8 billion?
Is this just something you want to believe?
That's not what happened here.
There was a compromise to end the use of coal 2030, so the energy companies are allowed to burn that crap until then.
The compromise also saved 5 towns from beeing destroyed for a even bigger mining expansion, even without the Ukraine war this would have happened.
Unfortunately, a lot of russian gas needs be substituted by coal for while because what's the alternative?
'Robert Habeck, Germany's economy and climate minister — and a member of the Green party that helped complete the deal — said in a video posted to Twitter that the agreement is a "painful" but necessary compromise caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine that has forced Germany to reboot its coal plants.
'.
True, but the original deal was to end coal in 2038.
The new agreement is basically - and very simplified - to burn more coal now, because of the war, and get out of coal 8 years earlier.
