Wars are often won by finding the right trade-off between quantity and quality, finding the most effective tools, and mini-maxing on those.
This includes WW2, where Nazi Germany was often obsessed with quality to the point they invested a ton but weren’t able to make more than a few, or even didn’t make what they planned to at all, while the US made equipment that worked well enough, and poured huge amounts instead into critical B-29s and later nukes.
That said NK produces a mountain of shit that doesn’t have a chance even against what NATO can casually throw away.
I've heard that US airplanes in WW2 weren't nearly as good as the nazi ones, except that we could crank them out at insane speeds and we just overwhelmed them.
Thats a bit of an oversimplification, US aircraft were excellent albeit in different areas than the Germans.
Requirements were quite different - the Germans never could build bombers or escort fighters that were equivalent to what the USAAF used for instance.
The Germans were also more willing to essentially use prototypes on the field because they were desperate.
A Me-262 looks futuristic, because it was at the time and was incredibly unreliable.
Its even worse when you look at the rocket propelled Me-163, nobody in their right mind would mass produce such a thing except a country desperate for a secret weapon.
This has the side effect of making them look more advanced vs countries that did not risk their pilots with machines that were not ready for mass production.
