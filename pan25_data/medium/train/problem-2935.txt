Oh I know, World War One is brutal, Im from Canada (which had a huge historic implication for the country) so in high school we spend a good portion learning about World War One and they don’t hold back the turn horrors of that war (and even then I don’t think we went nearly as deep into detail) i can only imagine what the late 30’s to early 40’s would’ve been like for people who had to experience the darkest war of all time, being told and hell maybe even having to be involved with a second one after they ended what they thought would be the War to end all wars.
I find it hilarious that I was discussing that harrier stuff, and one of the arguements made was that "civilians can't/shouldn't own military fighter jets", and i turned right around and pointed out Paul Allen (Microsoft rich guy) bought a MiG-29.
I know someone who bought a bunch of migs when the soviet union collapsed after Afghanistan.
Its not like you can arm them legally so its really no different from owning another plane.
