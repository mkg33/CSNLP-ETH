Muslims are going to be led around by the nose, if they remain vulnerable to people like Putin manipulating them by staging things like book-burnings in other countries.
By the way, the west protected Muslim countries many times.
If it wasn't for the "imperialist" US, Saudi Arabia wouldn't have been independent and would've been conquered by Iran or Iraq.
Hell NATO is the only reason why Kuwait is an independent country.
Learn to be grateful kid.
Cool, then get the fuck out of it.
Go somewhere cool like Afghanistan Somalia or Saudi Arabia and you won't have to worry about scary uncivilized things like freedom of expression.
Whether you like it or not, you'll learn to respect freedom of expression if you want to be part of the western world or live in the west.
If other people expressing themselves is too much for you and your thin skin it's pretty easy to remedy: leave.
Countries like Somalia, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan etc would welcome you.
Muslims express their disliking of other religions without being too shy about it, can you imagine if the west refused to defend Saudi Arabia during the gulf war because they don't allow other religions into mecca?
Or because Saudi scholars are the source of several fatwas against Christmas?
Etc.
