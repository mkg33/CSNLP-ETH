Canada has stronger worker protection laws than many countries.
The cop broke her contract and her employer is punishing her relative to her breach.
She might bring this to court, but firing her could lead the supreme court.
BTW, Canada's supreme court is not the the same as the US based on the fundamentals of Canadian law, and the stronger separation of the judicial branch.
I can't decide if you're indignant that I should ask your opinion or just don't feel more qualified than an internet search.
For what it's worth, I gave it the same search and I can't conclude that the Canadian judiciary is any more or less "political," and there are no appointment process guardrails any more or less than in the US (fewer by my count).
And pointing to the basis of Canada's legal system?
Both countries rely on Common and Civil law.
So I don't see how either point makes the Supreme Court of Canada "more separate" than in the US.
It must be in something more specific.
I don't feel like summarizing a Google search for you so I'll only list one point.
Canadian Supreme court justices are not politically aligned, because that's the whole point of separation of powers.
The more important point regards the bases of Canadian law and I'll let you find a Youtuber or something else to figure out yourself.
I'm not a legal educator.
I'll say that Justice Ginsberg is on record as saying that the power of Canada's Supreme Court is less than SCOTUS and that it was the correct way to do business.
