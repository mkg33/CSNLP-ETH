This is not political decision it is government aka civil service decisin.
there are LOADS of companies doing this.
I have just finished a project ...
The replacement cameras/systems are also made in china - however they have had their code checked and verified.

Large UK company I was doing work for got taken over by a US company in a worldwide shopping spree, and from this perspective - any huawei kit to be removed from network in a quick time scale, no huawei phones for business purposes ... and so on.
..would love to hear of an example of hardware that carries out a useful function without any form of coding/instruction set ?
Further in the context of this a piece of hardware that carries out data acquisition and onward transmission without any code.
