Lots of right wingers here are complaining about California's gun laws, yet those idiots don't realize that most of those anti-gun laws were passed by the Reagan administration.
The Republicans did so because black people were getting armed for their own protection from bigots like Republicans and their neo-nazi/kkk allies.
Republicans wanted black people to be defenseless against the attacks from Republicans.
Hilariously California republicans, including Reagan, banned firearms in public as an Emergency Measure in response to a few openly armed black protesters peacefully and legally entering the capitol.
