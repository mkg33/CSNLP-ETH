I know everyone hates to hear it but it makes sense.
Your paying for a license to watch these movies and friends sharing this account didnt pay the license fee.
In the early 80s, UK's copyright piracy laws were extremely lax, and when the videotape movie industry exploded on the world, there were guys with banks of VCRs in their basements, cloning enormous amounts of pirated films.
They are being overzealous in warning people over something that no police force would ever bother to prosecute.
It's the British government, just ignore it.
they are almost certainly deflecting from something one of them has done, or they have screwed something up and they are trying to get people to ignore it.
Do you think its fair if an account owner shared their account with 1000 people?
Money would definitely be lost in that scenario.
Whats the difference between sharing this content to people that arent paying the license/account fee with pirating?
Millions of users each sharing their accounts with a few people each is going to add up to a lot of money being lost.
How are they going to recover this loss?
Increase the price which none of you want and further adds to the problem.
