Worse than Roberts in my opinion is Thomas.
I can't believe that bastard took the place of Thurgood Marshall, who heroically argued Brown V Board of Ed.
Thomas is an absolute bastard.
I read Dobbs, and the majority opinion was an abomination, but Thomas made them look tame by comparison.
The most telling bit is how he discredited all the substantive due process cases except Loving V. Virginia, obviously because his wife is white.
So he's fine taking rights away from women and gays, but heaven forfend if someone goes after the rights HE finds valuable!
If you're only willing to support human rights if you personally benefit from them, then rights become meaningless.
And I rarely go after people personally, but that asshole's wife was embedded eyeballs deep in the Jan 6 insurrection.
I'm glad he cheated on her, though I pity the poor woman who had to sleep with that human turd.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
