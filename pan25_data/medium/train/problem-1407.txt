Curious what happens to their assets and wealth, at least what hasn't already been frozen overseas.
I assume much of it is dictated by wills or similar legal process.
But is there portions or types of assets that can be siphoned off by Russian government?
Estate taxes?
Hidden money that the govt/fsb knows about or can access that wouldn't be in a will?
Don't get me wrong, I suspect some of these are more about fear / sending a message, but wouldn't be surprised if there are financial aspects as well.
Do you have to pay income tax on inherited money in Russia perhaps?
That could be one way this benifits the Russian government.
Other then the outright stealing and killing of course.
Idk... i hear windows are dangerous.
Thats why in west we put hight locks on em.. give it another 20 years.. they'll catch up... obviously they still in the 80's with seagal...
