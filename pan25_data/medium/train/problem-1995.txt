I have super conservative family that I tricked into being in favor of some left policies by convincing them it was a republican that supported the policies.
The reason they want to up the retirement age is because Republicans have used social security as their personal piggy bank for decades now!
Need to pay for a war, take it from social security.
Need to pay for a tax cut for the rich, take it from social security.
On and on.
Now they don't want to pay it back.
That's what it really is.

This was a big news story in Kentucky when trump was first elected.
They wanted to repeal and replace Obamacare, but you better not touch their ACA.
The guy they voted for out of ignorance had no stated plan to replace it with.
What I really laugh at though is some of the people that are so against anything resembling single payer healthcare policies.
These are policies that would personally save them money, but that they fundamentally oppose because it would mean their tax dollars might help a poor family gain access to healthcare.
My brother in law is against it because "socialism" but it would save him a considerable amount of money.
