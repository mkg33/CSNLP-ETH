Why define "public relations experts" when things like "influence peddling," "dark money" and "crypto" are not?
Sometimes, the money went directly to political operations; Majority Forward, a dark-money group designed to elect Senate Democrats, received cash.
In some cases, the hired guns, such as PR firms, were paid directly for their services.
In others, the groups that received donations maintain that they are independent, but had interests aligned with FTX.
And holy shit... firms like BP, Phillip Morris, Nestle and plenty of others did far worse than take money from stupid crypto bros -- they killed people.
And got away with it for decades.
FTX has only been a company for like 2 years.

I'm also having trouble finding the news here.
Admittedly, I have no dog in this hunt.
But finding out one of FTX's vendors is a firm owned by the former aide of a guy who hasn't been a Senator for six years feels... underwhelming, at best.
