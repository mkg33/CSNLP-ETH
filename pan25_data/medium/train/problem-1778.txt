Very noncredible article, no other sources saying this and no turkish outlets whatsoever confirming this, why would Erdogan threaten Greece ahead of election time and then de-escalate in Syriah?
Strong men are gonna strong men and he ain't leaving Syria with a strong kurdish presence still there on their borders.
That is ignorant of the cause of the escalation, creating an area to settle Syrian refugees.
The political backlash against the refugees is a major factor in the unpopularity of ErdoÄŸan and getting rid of them is the main objective of the operations in Syria.
Failing to make progress would be disastrous in the upcoming election.
The probability of officially agreeing to pull out but still holding a claim to the territory is highly possible.
It doesn't seem like him to concede an inch of land there unless usa/russian forces come close to his troops, he's a bully like putin and would never concede land until a stronger bully shows up.
An added benefit is the that Syrian regime would attempt to wipe the "rebels" out, instead of Turkiye who eventually would be stuck with an armed insurgency.
They can later step in as heroes and get public support if the regime can't recapture it.
That's a security risk in a much weaker state if they are serious about annexing parts of northern Syria later on.
He's leaving the North west, not north east.
Judging from the understanding mentioned in the article it seems Turkiye and the Syrian regime will target Kurdish militia together with Russian backing.
I don't trust this news at all, at least not until some other sources confirm it, however, even if it is true, I can only see it going one of two ways: They talk big game but it all falls apart later on and status quo continues .
Or, Turkish troops withdraw and maybe provide some military assets to Syria to get them to do the fighting and Syrian regime botches it, either intentionally or through sheer incompetence.
