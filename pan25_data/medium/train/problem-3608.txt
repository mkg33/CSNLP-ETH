All parties need to come together to denounce this and pass laws to protect democracy.
Anyone who uses this for political points plays right into the hands of the bad actors.
This is only a symptom.
The disease comes from way too high inequality, and way too concentrated economic power (e.g.
corporations, ultra rich, etc.).
Of course, it isn't as bad as in the US.
But it's still bad.
And the fucking internet.
Not just social media, but the internet as a whole.
All of it.
The open, social, participatory internet is a gaping vulnerability, allowing anyone anywhere to compromise a nations psyche and poison civility and order.
There's a reason why places like Cina and Russia have their internets walled off and heavily regulated, because they know exactly how dangerous it is.
And China is only exploiting the backdoor elite Canadians themselves put in place to get what they want, without having to respect normal democratic processes.
The big question: will these elites, and ultra rich, and other powerful Canadians willingly close that backdoor?
Will they renounce their corrupt ways for the greater good, and also to resist China?
Or will they betray Canadians for their own selfish interests and greed, and see Chinese interference as only a normal cost of doing business....?
