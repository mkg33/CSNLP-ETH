I’ve met some incredibly Christ like individuals - a coworker’s prayer group privately raised $1,200 to help my wife and I pay for our newborn’s heart surgery.
Totally unprompted, unadvertised, pure compassion for our situation.
That felt Christ-like.
But for many organizations as a whole, there’s a disproportionate emphasis on the gloom and doom of the Old Testament while kind of glossing over the inclusiveness of Jesus’s message.
I feel it should be possible to appeal to true followers of Christ’s teachings using the compassion angle, yet it seems some of the fiercest self-described Christians are also the least Christ-like.
