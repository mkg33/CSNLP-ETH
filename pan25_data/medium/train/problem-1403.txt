Bee numbers have crashed 60% between 2004 and today.
Six.
Tee.
Per.
Cent.
When there is nothing left to pollinate our crops, blame the morons who thought regressively allowing harmful pesticides was the right thing to do.
It's fuckin insane being someone who was born in 2004 to experience this drop.
When I was young I would marvel at the little buggers flying to all the plants near my house and now I'm lucky to see just a few during the summer.
Awful sense of doom to the whole thing.
And today we find that Tate & Lyle get to destroy the entire UK bee population for their profits.
This flies in the face of science and as previously mentioned, every other developed country.
Â£72M tax free bung from the Tories to allow them to dodge import taxes, humane working conditions and environmental standards by allowing the import of sugar cane.
Previously of course EU standards prevented this from being imported into the EU.
We would like to thank the UK for offering themselves as a control group for what happens to bee species when one isolated country fails to ban neonicotinoids.
