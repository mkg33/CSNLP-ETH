You can only slaughter so many people.
Eventually it will all rebound.
Holding together so many people in a vice like grip can't happen in perpetuity.
It will always eventually unravel.
Empirically, such regimes will always eventually crumble.
That's not down to a few individuals falling through the cracks.
What's happening in China was always going to happen.
However, I suspect its unlikely to bring down the regime.
It will eventually fall but not just yet.
Zero party systems are really single party systems.
Single party systems don't work as they eventually corrupt.
Two party systems are not much better regarding corruption.
3+ parties are less corrupt but less stable.
The soviet union was held together with a vice like grip.
Those that slipped through the net didn't matter because there weren't enough of them.
These regimes always factor a few falling through the cracks into their tactics and equations.
The West will do their best to accelerate the process but not for human rights reasons.
They want access to the vast numbers of people etc so they can exploit them and expand their dubious influence.
The same went for the soviet union.
We didn't care about the peoples rights etc we only wanted access to so multinationals could exploit the people.
And that's exactly what they have done.
Conversely it's pretty easy to point to what the Russian interference in the 2016 election was.
They set up spam internet camps in places like Belarus and Thailand, paying people to propagate fake news and misinformation.
There have been massive FB pages with millions of followers that have been outed as set up to do this.
Even if US intelligence is somehow amplifying the calls on Chinese social media, which is probably impossible given that they are a locked down system unlike Western platforms with harsh government control of moderation, that is completely different from the analogy you are trying to make.
