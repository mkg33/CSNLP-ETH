Did he say, "moron..." under his breath after saying that?
“What I don’t like are the lies and ‘disinformation’ put out by the Democrats and RINOs.
They said the vice president has ‘absolutely no choice,’ it was carved in ‘steel,’ but if he has no choice, why are they changing the law saying he has no choice?” Trump posted.

Nope, I’m talking about the ruling that EC members must vote as dictated to them by their states.
The EC was specifically created to Prevent election of a demagogue, and it failed spectacularly because of this.
