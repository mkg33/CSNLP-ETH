Edit; 3 autoDMs about my mental health, so lovely to see the trolls still abuse that to harass users.
The title should say they're removing Chinese cameras from over 200 gov buildings, not that they're removing 200 cameras.
It's likely many thousands of cameras.
You joke but their market share of smartphones is growing really fast for a lot of people's comfort haha...
Tiktok is owned by a chinese company, which is owned by the CCP.
Therefore, tiktok is owned by the CCP.
Good luck convincing the users of tiktok that the CCP having ownership of the app (and by extension all the data it collects) is a bad thing, though.
I have family that use it.
It just seems like pure garbage.
Reminds me of old school commercial breaks that you flip through until your show comes back around.
Except, there is no show.
Yep.
Generally speaking, most people have no fucking clue how much data tiktok is siphoning from their phones, or how invasive the app truly is, or even what they AGREED to when they downloaded the app and accepted the terms and conditions.
Tragic.
