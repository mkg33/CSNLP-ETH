Really?
You actually believe the things provided amounted to "examples"?
'judges said x' is, at best, an anecdotal claim.
An example would be something like "case x or y would be different with this constitutional change" but no such case exists, there are no examples to provide because objectively, this changes nothing.
I'd be someone personally affected by any real changes to the rules on this matter, I'm not just talking from other people's perspectives and benefits.
This affects me, or it would if it actually changed anything.
It was already illegal, but it's now in the constitution.
On one hand it's a mostly symbolic gesture, on the other hand this should theoretically be more difficult to undo for future legislators.
"Discriminatie op basis van godsdienst, levensovertuiging, politieke gezindheid, ras, geslacht, of op welke andere grond dan ook, is verboden.
".
Nope.
Not in the slightest.
This is an entirely symbolic gesture that changes absolutely nothing but some of the wording, and arguably weakens the overall constitutional ban on discrimination by being specific about certain subjects.
While it might still be nice as a purely symbolic gesture, there really is no practical change to speak of.
