EDIT: and to clarify, I interpret "declare war" to mean that we do more to ACTIVELY defend Ukraine as opposed to the "passive" support of equipment & intel.
By no stretch of the imagination was I thinking we would be invading Russia or anything like that.
(Especially since Russia has already signaled that would be viewed as ur declaring war on them, etc.
).
Yeah.
But Putin is willing to push a little, see how other countries react and then go based on that.
That is kind of why supporting Ukraine is important for nato because letting Putin take Ukraine without any resistance would make it more likely that he thinks that he can see how nato reacts if a nato country is attacked.
Kind of how appeasement pre WW2 only lead to hitler finding excuse to attack even more countries.
- Ukraine was not pro west at all (see them, working against Romanian intersts and stealing German gas repeatedly from 1990s to _edit:_ 20120s __2010s__ without ever officially apologizing).
- Russia realized that the Ukrainian population changed their opinion (invalidating point 1 from above) and their government changed course to be a little less antagonistic towards EU as well with the Euromaidan revolution (at least partly mitigating point 2).
- Russia then moved to occupy Crimea, which would pull NATO into a war if they accepted Ukraine and that is not allowed per NATO regulations (technically if all NATO countries agreed, they could say 'fuck the regulations' and accept Ukraine anyways but that would be way harder).
Russian nuclear arsenal had no impact on Ukrainian NATO membership applications.
It does probably have implications for what the individiual countries are doing (i.e.
US/UK/EU not sending troops) but that is not a NATO jurisdiction since they are a defensive alliance.
That is up to the individual countries.
More pushback will probably come from other major nato countries as long as Russia got nukes.
No country willingly wants to fight a country with large amount of nukes.
