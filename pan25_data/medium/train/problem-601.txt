I am willing to debate anyone who criticizes Cuba.
My wife, who is a doctor, can attest to that.
That's so beautiful.
I vividly remember the image of a little Cuban boy crying trying to make his way to the US with his family when I was a kid.
If you're too young to remember, the group tried to make their way from Cuba to FL and everyone drowned.
He was the only survivor.
It sounded like a miracle at the time, in hindsight I can't imagine what it was like for him growing up.
There was a great deal of controversy surrounding what the right thing to do was.
He had family in both countries iirc.
While his family and loved ones intentions was to get him into the US, his father was in Cuba and fought for his son rightfully so.
It was a big deal and created quite the stir at the time.
Poor kid to be in the middle of all of it.
It will be interesting to learn the kind of man he's become today.
I hope he's found some peace and normalcy in his life.

I hope he finds peace, whatever that looks like for him in Cuba.
