So far that political concept worked well for the ruling party and has successfully held the Serbian Progressive Party in the government for over a decade.
Wouldn't really say that it has also worked well for their people's or overall countries progression tho.
Maybe that will have to change in the near future tho since the EU has been pressuring Serbia more and more to finally take a side and they are after all their biggest economical partner.
But who knows how that's gonna turn out, only the future can tell.
I play an early release of a game by Ukrainian developers.
Their whole Steam feed is shiposting about Russia then casually mentioning a update about the game.
In a dark way, it's hilarious.
One question I haven’t really asked in person before is, why are we still here?
Why does Serbia not find a new friend?
Why doesn’t it realign with GB or Germany or pull a Croatia and look to france?
Why can’t it play the diplomatic game?
It’s rather stunning just how long Serbia has been dissatisfied with it Russian dependence, far more than a century.
Even before ww1 they were annoyed that their best ally was militarily incompetent.
