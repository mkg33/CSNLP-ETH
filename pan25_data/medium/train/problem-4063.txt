TLDR - yet another minor political party has made the 10,000 signature requirement to be recognized.
They claim to be centrist, but stuck their foot in in the last race endorsing the Republican candidate.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
This is my personal opinion, but no.
What we call a centrist would be WAY right of center pretty much anywhere else in the world.
A centrist from 30 years ago would be considered left of most of the Democratic party today.
The Democratic Socialists of America would be the largest genuinely left-wing political organization, with just barely over 100,000 official members.
I tried looking into 3rd political parties, literally all of them are far-right parties pretending to be centrist.
Hell, the Constitution Party is even further to the right than the GOP.
Green Party is a Russian psyop, Libertarians are the ultimate corporate shills, etc.
