Technically they can attack from any point.
Though it would be nice to drag all damaged military hardware along lines where Russian would attack.
Nothing is more devastating for soldiers going to war than blow up military hardware they hope will help them survive.
Russian invaders are concentrating their offensive forces in eastern Ukraine.
However, the south of the country also remains under threat, as Natalia Humeniuk, the Head of Coordination Headquarters of Press Center of Ukrainian Southern Defence Forces, said during the national TV marathon.
According to her, Russians are deploying more trained personnel in the eastern part of the country.
Humeniuk emphasizes that this is where the enemy has focused its main efforts.
Everyone who believes the good must win the evil - you can support Ukrainian people in their fight for existence here: 🙏.
If Russia were to attack the South, are they planning to get Moldova?
They already have 1.5 - 2k soldiers in Transinitria and they also have a huge stash of ammo and such there.
Moldova barely has a military so they'd be gone rather fast.
