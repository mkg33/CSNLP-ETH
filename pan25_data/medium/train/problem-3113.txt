Ukrainian civilians are living under the tremendous stress from war and infrastructure damage.
In order to alleviate it, our popular media personalities often focus on weak, sometimes anecdotal, sides of the enemy: chmobiks, internal conflicts, undertrained convicts in wagner, etc.
While giving some kind of temporary relief, such messages often skew the public perception, underplaying the direness of the situation we're in.
Our enemy's media traditionally tries to amplify the stress by painting reality even worse.
That's why any negative outlook is often perceived with at least a suspicion.
About as many that think they know better than a Ukrainian general I'd guess.
The public at large are fucking idiots.
It annoys me to no end, suddenly everyone's an artillery expert because they just found out what a HIMARS is from the news.
Or people acting like they'd fight better than the conscripted russians, bro you ARE the conscripted russians.
Not just Russia.
Never underestimate your opponent small or large.
You never know what they have going for them.
If any lessons can be drawn from all the wars ever fought, it's the above statement.
Reminds me of the whole "black hawk down" fiasco.
They knew the militants had RPGs but decided to fly anyway because the backblast can be fatal if you aim an RPG skyward, and it's extremely unlikely to hit a moving helicopter with one.
They didn't count on them welding metal plates to the end to redirect the backblast so they could be safely fired at a high angle, and then spamming the sky with hundreds of shots until they got lucky.
Russia underestimated Ukraine so Putin gave a deadline.
With zeal and better weapons, they've come to realize that Ukraine is a string foe.
It's a good thing the Ukrainians are learning not to underestimate Russia either.
