A deal was made with a major gas company to start industrialization infrastructure in ukraine for the gas deposits in 2013, russia invaded in 2014 to destabilize the area and halt that development.
In 2012 ukraine discovered tons of new natural gas deposits (using new technology).
If ukraine started exporting gas to europe, it would price out russia and cause economic collapse.
It’s an existential crisis for russia.
They must at least hold on to crimea and eastern ukraine (containing 2/3rds of the gas deposits), or the russian government will completely implode.
So Russia has nothing to offer except gas, and their neighbor has gas of their own, so they just invaded for that gas.
Russia really wants to share their misery with everyone else.
Due to their deeply embedded corruption, there isn’t any sure fire solutions except for maybe total collapse.
I mean, we aren’t invading Canada for its oil.
And yes, the CIA committed war crimes in the Middle East with the black sites.
But what Russia is doing is incomparable.
They intend to keep all the land they have stolen, permanently.
They are abducting the children, and trying to move in Russians to settle what they’ve captured.
They think Ukraine isn’t a legitimate state, and has always been a part of Russia.
Basically all a shitty excuse to take over the competition in the only industry that makes them the most money.
