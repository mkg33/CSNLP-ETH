Fact is, since 1945 - stocks go up 11.2% with a Democrat as President, 6.9% with a Republican.
Since 1945, GDP grew by an average of 4.1% under Democrats, compared with 2.5% under Republicans.
Similar huge gaps also exist for job creation - it is not even close.
If you go back before 1945, then the gap widens even more for the stock market, jobs, and GDP.
Also, 10 of the last 11 recessions and 1 out of 1 Great Depressions started with a Republican President.
With a 90 year track record of the Democrats being about 2x better for the economy in all aspects, it can no longer be considered just a coincidence.
Consumer based policies are simply better than trickle down policies.
The big issue is the Republicans completely control the business and economic media and completely control the narrative.
Pretty wild to see corporate propaganda so boldly posted.
Oh no, a bunch of rich people are upset that government isnt gonna ramshod on peoples rights and may actually act like adults!
