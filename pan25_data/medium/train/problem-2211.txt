I have a bunch of Republican family members in FL and they genuinely believe that the Dems are somehow getting away with all kinds of improprieties regarding voting and the Republicans are just too nice and fair to fight back.
They really believe this.
So yeah, I'm sure they think anything they do to "balance" that is justified.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
No the other poster had it right.
Theyre sure Democrats are committing improprieties, so anything they do in response to the ghosts their fighting is justified in their sick pervert minds.
And of course you can largely blame Fox News, which they watch exclusively and which relentlessly pushes that narrative.
