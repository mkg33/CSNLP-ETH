Yeah weâ€™ve heard that before, do they also have the largest collection of white flags?
And do their tanks still have 1 forward gear and 4 for reverse?
Well Italy isnt exactly famous for being good at war.
The last time you tried to fight you lost against fucking Greece and Ethiopia.
And that combined with the italian army in north africa in WW2 has kinda ruined italys military reputation forever.
We The Italians don't give a fuck about this , We are SUPERPROUKRAINE , our army did not release ANY note about "what weapons" we gave to ukraine and i think that's a reason , we are providing good shit but can't talk about coz russia still hold one of our two big balls , our home gas and oil prices are still high for people and industry(where people work and risk to lose job) , so "we the people " live on our skin everyday this damn dance on the edge of the cliff.
but anyway we are glad to do this.
Becouse We are European with the same Ideal of freedom and justice, even if you can't find it everyday, everywhere around you ; "We Are This Ideal".
I mean, this is even sorta what the article implies.
It's Meloni being upset that she wasn't invited because she too is very pro Ukraine and would like to be involved.
As long as countries/leaders are arguing about who is the most supportive to Ukraine, I'm a happy guy.
WW1 was over before you entered it.
WW2 Germany and Japan declared war on you.
Thats the only reason you fought.
The american people were mostly pro Germany until pear harbour.
