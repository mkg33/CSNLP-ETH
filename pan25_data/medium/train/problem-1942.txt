FYI for many Westerners: India gets about 80%!
of its military hardware from Russia.
Its main enemy in the region is China, not Russia.
It tries to maintain good relations with Russia and the West.
Russia’s issues were at least as much training, planning, and maintenance as it was the general quality if equipment.
They should have done better with what they have.
Not confirmed, but almost certainly the case.
The Ukrainians are also doing good things with their drones, and calling in arty strikes with incredible precision.
The footage is insane.
The Russians are also not doing themselves any favors by being complete slobs in their encampments.
They just throw their neon green MRE bags everywhere and stick out like a sore thumb.
They look like hobo camps.
That’s a big no no, and sign of poor leadership from top down.
Ukraine uses mostly the T-64.
A Ukrainian designed and produced system.
Russian tanks are mostly T72s and their rebranded cousin the T-90.
The T-72 was the discount dollar tank made because the T-64 was too expensive to produce in the numbers the Soviet Union wanted.
Russias main tank is literally the cheap knock off of Ukrains main tank.
Not just that.
They are getting the stripped down export versions of Russian shit.
So not even as good as the actual Russian shit.
And they plan on fighting China with this stuff?
