So you're telling me this near-pariah state notorious for supporting terrorism and carrying out acts of terrorism using terrorist proxies and giving sanctuary to terrorists will likely collapse economically due to systemic corruption, ineptitude, and mismanagement.
Cool.
Now to the important question, what should I have for breakfast?
I can reheat last night's hotdogs, but I'm out of buns.
Should I just pretend it's a sausage?
I can have cereal, but I'm out of bananas and strawberries.
Well ur hot dogs would be coming out of ur ass real quick when u remember Pak is a nuclear nation.
I wonder what would happen when the Taliban and co get their hands on nukes.
A terrorist state using its nuclear arsenal to threaten the world into prolonging its existence is a far more dangerous situation.
One does not allow cancer to spread simply because it holds some vital organ hostage, one excises it--with radiotherapy if necessary.
I am sure that the US war on terror and the bombings of the middle East would become much more dangerous.
