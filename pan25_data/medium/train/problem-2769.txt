Legal definitions of genocide do not include "kill all X everywhere".
Recent-ish definitions used legally include efforts to remove a populace of a certain ethnicity from within a border, or to destroy their cultural memory (i.e.
by stealing their children, giving them away, and removing their ability to have more children), or to undertake a campaign of violence towards a populace for a perceived threat until that threat no longer exists (caravans at the border, crime, violence, taking our jobs, etc).
removing children from their legal asylum seeking parents with no plans to ever reunite them, and performing forced hysterectomies on women = kinda like the Holocaust.
I was alive back when the Cambodian genocide was going on.
I remember when I heard they were killing people just for wearing glasses because they felt those people looked smart so might be a threat to their revolution I was absolutely dumbfounded that the world wasn’t stepping in.
The next time I heard the phrase “Never Again” I said right then “Bullshit” A 15 year old kid shouldn’t be that jaded by international politics but welcome to this world.
