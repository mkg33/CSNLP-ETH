If someone lives their entire life under an occupation, and (in the 13 year olds case) has had family members harassed and even killed, is it really surprising that these people are drawn to extremism?
The cause of all of this is Israel's inability to settle their differences with the Palestinians.
And this is because those in power in Israel want a Jewish state first and foremost, it benefits them to keep the Palestinians, suppressed, pushed out of their homes and killed, and it's even better if they retaliate because 'it's them who don't want peace', even though Israel is a country built on the mass exodus of the people who lived there for centuries.
The Palestinians are in a constant state of persecution and intimidation with no means of realistically retaliating, with no political (and certainly violent) means of emancipation or road to proper statehood.
So whilst regrettable, it's important to remember which side holds the cards, and who's oppressing who.
From my understanding it is because there can be a threat at any moment and with such a high density of a population in such a small area it helps with any threat.
