We can counter what we can but they'll slip through unless every firsteam has the right anti uas tool for the frequency and type.
Even still, they may be preprogrammed ones that'll still fuck up infantry.
Tanks - we already knew their role but we'll "learn again" from how poss poorly Russia is using them (without infantry or other cover).
We knew what we thought future war will be, and while this isn't true world power on world power it's a pretty good message that's telling us we need to keep pressing ideas like expeditionary basing, rapid redployment/relocation of artillery and high value assets and honestly infantry.
We need to be lighter, faster, and more frequently mobile/maneuvering to avoid the targeting cycle of the future.
And of course we get this while, as you or others said, expending our old reserved, learning lessons for future systems, and watching Russian equipment burn...
