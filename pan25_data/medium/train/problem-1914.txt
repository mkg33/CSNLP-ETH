The President held a meeting of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief Staff.
The situation in the Bakhmut direction was examined in detail.
Particular attention was paid to the training of Ukrainian defenders abroad.
The elimination of the consequences of the recent enemy missile attack on the territory of Ukraine was also discussed.
BTW, do we have an idea of the current rate of production of artillery by Russia ?
With the current rate of loss, it looks like it could be, a little unexpectedly, one of the categories that could be depleted first.
Zelenskyy in interview with Sky News: "They don't want negotiations, and it was like that before the invasion.
We hope that when Russia withdraws its troops, there will be a new government in the Russian Federation.
Then, probably, negotiations will be possible./After the full-scale invasion, putin is a nobody to me.
I just want them to stop the war as soon as possible and leave our country as soon as possible.
".
Its' good to see the artilleries in big numbers since like 2 or 3 weeks.
Did something change in UA tactics ?
Did they get new anti-artillery solutions ?
