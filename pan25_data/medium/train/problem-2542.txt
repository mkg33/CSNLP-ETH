Chinese destroyers are not based on Russian tech.
In fact, they seem to be heavily influenced by stolen US tech.
Experts have estimated they're not quite as good as an Arleigh Burke, but not too far off.
They're pumping out at a steady rate - at least 5 of them in production now.
They don't need to project power across the world through carriers, when their targets are right next door.
The state of their nuclear arsenal is not well understood at the moment, but they don't need enough nukes to saturate the world 3 times over - they need just enough to give pause to the US, which they definitely have.
You're also underestimating their "civilian" fleet, which will transform into a giant logistics network in case of war.
I'm not saying everything is rosy in the world, but I would take everything with a very big grain of salt that is being said by people, who have a massive interest in getting more people to join.
Fear mongering is an effective way to do so.
This!
Hasn't the US military been complaining for a while that interest for the military was dwindling?
