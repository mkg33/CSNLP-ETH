I just want to mention the student wearing the Oxford Strong shirt was from Royal Oak and not an Oxford student.
The shirt was part of a fundraiser.
They were interviewed by WXZY-TV.
Still shocking and completely obscene.
You know that saying on the internet some Facebook snowflakes use "owning the libs"... yeah, that's their entire platform.
It's not even conservative ideologies anymore.
it's just whatever the opposing faction is against.
That's how you end up with a nation that can vigoursly politize wearing masks, have uneducated bigotted gremlins as representatives, and not do a single thing when I bunch of elementary grade children get mowed down (that was an entire decade ago btw and this supposed great nation has a high score of over 50 school shootings since).
U.S. is a pathetic shithole of a nation with a government that doesn't give a single fuck about its people, a large population of uneducated bigots, and found you can just work around the whole label of corruption by just giving it another name and legalizing it.
