I guess.
Nobody should actually do it unless they're that braindead (Like FIFA already being dumb choosing QATAR of all places.
Should've chosen Brazil again.
).
Bruh…..come on.
FIFA has been corrupt, basically FOREVER.
Same can be said for the IOC.
Also, dude it’s Qatar.
Their track record for human rights violations is stupid long and easily found.
Especially with the World Cup 2022.
Do you want proof on Qatar's human rights violations or FIFA's kowtowing to Qatar or the rampant cheating in FIFA?
What exactly are you wanting evidence of that you obviously didn't bother googling?
Well, the whole Qatar shit happening and I saw an article the other day where a Ex-FIFA director literally called for Ukraine and Russia to cut the war out while the World Cup is going on.
My 2 cents, I dunno, I ain't American.
I don't even watch Football, what am I doing here?
So 1,008 people in 1yr.
How many of those were results of gross negligence, humans rights violations, or people having their passports forcibly removed from them?
