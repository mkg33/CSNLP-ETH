Yeah but he also says tied to that they already have found external aid and will continue to look for it to help keep up with their military output.
He doesn't say they are going to run out of stuff to shoot at Ukraine anytime soon.
This is just another example of what I said in my comment, where the headlines make it seem much worse than it is.
We should also count ammunition from Belarus, from which Russia has taken more than 20,000 tons of ammunition.
We don’t know how large stocks are in Belarus, but by transferring its armored equipment and ammunition to Russia, Belarus remains a major resource.
So his skepticism is based on the fact that Belarus and North Korea could also be supplying them?
Well that’s something.
I feel like the "Russia is going to run out of ammo" is all spin from media headlines.
I don't think any of the military leaders/analysts of the world have said Russia will run out of ammo on any level outside of their more sophisticated stuff that require western tech.
It's a big deal still but I feel like I see a lot of headlines trying to spin it as if Russia won't be able to keep firing shit at Ukraine for much longer and that probably isn't true.
