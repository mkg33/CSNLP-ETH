These appear to be planned in a way to send a message without also causing massive disruption and harm to patients.
The strikes are scheduled on two separate days spanning two weeks on Thu Dec 15 and Tue Dec 20.
Rail unions at also on strike and its the same there.
The tories are deliberately provoking these strikes.
At the very last moment when negotiating rail bosses demanded the unions accepted driver only trains across the network.
They have long been opposed to this.
Talks that were progressing towards resolution were immediately ended.
Just as the government wanted and expected.
The tories are looking for excuses to bring in totalitarian laws banning strikes.
They want to finally hammer down the unions once and for all.
Yes they are.
I also think the rail unions made a major mistake by calling Xmas strikes.
They shouid not have done this as they've played straight into the tories hands.
I suspect that the unions thought that they wouid try and force the tories hand.
Unfortunately the tories have called their bluff.
The unions are running out of options.
They only have all out strike left.
Once again I suspect the union know they can't be confident of getting a majority vote for that.
