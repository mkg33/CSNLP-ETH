For those wondering, they made a similar decision allowing people to call for the death of Putin after the start of the Russian invasion.
The other side of the argument is that if you do, then you can actually protect these dictators and be quelling resistance to invasions and crackdowns.
They are an American company and allowing threats on your platform (corporate company-owned social media is NOT protected by Free Speech laws) to share threats against the president of the USA opens up legal problems.
I have been on a forum that had such rules even though the the owner was not at all US-friendly.
"Death to Biden" is not an illegal statement to make, although it is controversial and could very well get you an FBI or SS visit.
Even saying that you wish Trump was executed by a red-hot sword being shoved up his ass is not an illegal statement to make.
Explicit threats, or the explicit encouragement of violence, is generally illegal.
Wanting someone dead or expressing that view is not by itself illegal.
“I wish _____ would get shot.” or “Someone should shove a rusted spork up _____’s ass and let them bleed out.” ✅.
“I am going to shoot _____.” or “I am actively looking to hire someone and have every intention of paying them to shove a rusted spork up _____’s ass and let them bleed out.” ❌.
I guess that is where the intent comes in, which admittedly does make it more difficult to address since intent is not always clear.
The same sentence (someone should kill ____) could realistically be taken one of two separate meanings (vague “the world would be better without ____” vs. not-so-vague “i am specifically pleading that someone end ____’s life”).
I really feel for whoever has the job of reviewing/investigating these, as it sounds like a massive ethical responsibility to have to sit on someone’s shoulders… and a PITA having to clearly discern what the intent of a post is.
I honestly don’t blame platforms for just auto-removing outright with how much goes into it.
Love that.
Same sentence, both extortion, but one threatens violence for money and the other invokes fear and uncertainty for money… both incredibly crooked.
Also, you are falling into the mistake where you think social media companies have any obligation towards freedom of speech.
They do not.
They are corporations and can apply whatever arbitrary rules they deem necessary.
Each social media company like Twitter (both before and after Musk) has its own rules that it can arbitrarily chose.
In fact, it is alwas up to the moderation team's call what to do with a given problematic post or not.
I am not clear on the specifics.
I think the issue is that the secret service of the US might be particular (who are specifically charged with protecting the president) and it is better to make the rule than to deal with them.
