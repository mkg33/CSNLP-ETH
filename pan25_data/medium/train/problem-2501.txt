Roman slaves, often prom the provinces could earn money prior to manumission.
Also, those who were in Nexum literally were working off debt bondage.
Slavery in the Roman world was often a temporary position at the bottom of society before becoming freedmen.
And it’s worth mentioning that gladiators were pretty much the equivalent of ancient rockstars.
Their names were scrawled across hundreds of ancient walls by adoring fans who were as passionate about their favourite gladiator as someone today might support a football team or like a certain sportsman.
Images of fights were depicted on walls and floors across the Roman Empire.
Not to mention that most major Roman settlements included an amphitheater where the fights were held, and during elections it wasn’t totally unheard of for politicians to offer free gladiator fights to the people to win favour.
Also, part of the appeal of gladiator fighting was that it was totally possible for them to become obnoxiously rich much like today.
There’s records of well known gladiators being the Roman equivalent of multi-millionaires.
They put on exhibition shows and did endorsements.
They even toured and did shows in different locations.
This isn’t true to an extent.
Some gladiators were slaves.
But others were criminals whose sentence was fighting as a gladiator and some were active volunteers who entered the training schools completely of their own free will.
From what I’ve been able to gather it was more of a theatre act than an actual fight.
The pomp was the main draw with the exotic animals and the many different ways that the fights were staged.
Some fights even included theatre-style scenery and the Colosseum had these lifts which allowed the gladiator to be lifted up to the arena looking like they’d appeared from the sand.
Given how much time, effort and money went into their training no gladiator was going to be mindlessly killed for its own sake.
