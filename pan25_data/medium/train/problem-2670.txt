After the Libor Scandal, I'm surprised anyone trusts their assets in the Pound at all.
Brexit and their continued right wing policies just pushed it over the edge.
If the arse falls out of the GBP to USD parity, or less, then it will never recover.
Brexit provided the final nail in the coffin and this recession is likely to be deep as it is long.
No matter who leads this government it will remain a dithering pack of ninnies for another two, very long years.
With the Schengen denial shit that Netherlands and Sweden might be doing, I think more European stock will lose some of the value.
I don't think that the East-Europan countries will allow this shitty game of long-waiting / denial before retaliation.
As usual, it will happen, it's just that Sweden and the Netherlands want something in return, just haven't stated what that is.
And, not to shit on countries like Croatia, Bulgaria and Romania (and I support their Schengen ascension), but...I'm not exactly shaking in my boots regarding their power to retaliate.
They pretty much have to continue to play nice no matter what for the time being.
