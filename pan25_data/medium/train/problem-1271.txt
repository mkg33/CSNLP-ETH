The gutting of the middle class, increased costs of raising a healthy nuclear family (which society heavily pressures people to do), instability in the work place, decline of social support systems (and its replacement with much less healthy elements in social media) and increases in poverty caused by wealth concentration were always going to open the gates to these kinds of issues.
My one hope is that by exposing our society's deep problems, it's finally also forcing us to confront them, even if only slowly.
