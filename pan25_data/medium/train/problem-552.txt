India might actually invent things instead of just steal.
That’s a huge difference when it comes to having a real relationship with a country.
Russia can’t even do either of those well anymore.
China can't invent things.
It's antithetical to the culture because creativity requires going against the grain.
Thinking outside the box.
Looking at a problem critically and openly discussing the failures.
If you’re referring to military tech, no country is ever inventing anything more advanced than the US.
And if you’re referring to other things, then there’s plenty of industries where China is the world leader technologically.
Why not, might mean they may experience some rapid growth until they fall out of favour with the US by virtue of being the second largest economy in the world, and thus the next big threat to the USA.
If there is one good thing about COVID, it's that this finally isn't up for debate anymore.
See how they are still sealing people inside buildings and aiming for zero COVID?
Notice how robotic the whole thing is?
See how much it's taken for some of the citizens to actually call out the bullshit in front of them?
It's a direct result of the culture the CCP has worked to install for decades.
They throw bodies at a problem because people are cheap.
People you can't control are expensive.
Which is why admitting failure or changing a course is becoming impossible.
