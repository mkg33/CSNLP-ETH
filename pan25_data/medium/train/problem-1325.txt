Not all of those voters are forward thinking and well informed.
From what I've seen apathy prevails in young people who are ignorant.
They tend to just not vote rather than vote Republican because they believe their votes don't count or the system is rigged etc.
etc.
Because the system IS rigged against them and has been for their entire lives.
Many of these young people voted for Donald Trump in 2016 because they thought he would "shake things up".
In Democrats, they just see more of the same.
So my point is, that 27% may be close to the percentage of young people that actually understand things and give a sht beyond just following in their parents footsteps and voting R. Also, it's HARD to vote as a young person.
You have to: 1.
Know how to do it.
2.
Remember to register ahead of time with your current address, because you move every year in search of lower rent.
3.
Find ACCURATE information about the elections amidst all the fake news on tiktok.
4.
Get time off from work or school while living paycheck to paycheck with crushing student loan debt.
5.
Overcome all the Republican voting restrictions that apply doubly if you're a minority.
Honestly it's a wonder that 1 in 4 managed to get through all of that.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
