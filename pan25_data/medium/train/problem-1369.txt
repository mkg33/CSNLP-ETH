If anyone cares to read the article it explains that US Sec.
Austin says that nuclear proliferation “can be A BYPRODUCT of this war and that nato will not be dragged into Putin’s war of choice”.
He means that other autocratic dictators might see developing nukes as cover for attacking countries without them.
Headline is clickbait.
Do you think people posting things like this don’t know that?
Ha!
The more I read comments in this kind of threads, the more I’m convinced some use it as an excuse to get their beloved, clouding dose of fear-and-doom and share with others, like a heroin shot.
And that’s so fucking sad.
Just think we have made it this long without anyone using nukes after Nagasaki.
There is a strong nuclear taboo that even tactical nukes that are comparable to conventional weapons aren’t used.
If we assume the events that could escalate to cause a nation to use nuclear weapons are random, then the probably of using nuclear weapons declines over time.
A tactical use of a nuke doesn't give Russia any advantage and because of the taboo nature of using such a device it's very doubtful you could describe any nuke as being possible to be used tactically because it's almost a certainty that NATO et al would have to react to the use of such a device.
Then the use of your tactical nuke has radically changed your strategy and actually makes your strategy less certain.
So any tactical nuke automatically becomes strategic and therefore tactical use of nukes doesn't exist.
