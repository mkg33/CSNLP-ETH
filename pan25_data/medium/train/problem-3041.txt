"Just a couple of generations ago, there was bitter fighting between Poles and Ukrainians in nearby border areas including the city of Przemy≈õl and parts of western Ukraine."
- Now they have common grounds: russian aggression to worry about.
This is not really new.
Some of those who theorised Poland's post communist future while in exile in the 70's and 80's gave place to Ukrainian writers in Ukrainians and suggested that Poland would be safe from Russian imperialism and its own imperialist tendencies if there was a Ukraine.
It also has turned younger Polish generations into Russian hating ones.
Millenials and younger did not REALLY have any specific reasons to hate Russia.
Unlike our grandparents who still had vivid memories we figured out that having shit government is something that can sometimes happen regardless of the people living there and that ultimately it's ancient history.
We have also seen how Germany which in history books is described as turning people into soap in excruciating detail in their concentration camps is somehow our ally now.
But then Russians start commiting war crimes as if it was a "Gotta do them all" pokemon spinoff while openly advocating for a war so a common understanding is now "well, it looks like most of the nation is rotten inside".
And THAT is something that even if Russia somehow ended up the war tomorrow will not get washed until at least 50 years from now.
It's impressive really how much of a pariah state Russia has become in 9 months.
And how pretty much anyone and everyone in here did something to help Ukrainians, be it donating towards their military funds to accepting them at homes.
War really brings both the best and worst of humanity, huh?
