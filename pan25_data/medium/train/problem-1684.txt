They're not using those post partum centers because there's no parental leave (which by the way many companies offer, though not as great as some other countries obv).
They're using it because it's the new normal, and they've been brainwashed with the belief that korean women have tougher times recovering due to the structure of their body and therefore need extra care post partum which is a bunch of BS.
The care centers are like a hotel with food, excercises and having older women teach you how to take care of your newborn.
It's a huge waste of money, but many Koreans will never admit it cause they won't dare to break the norms, despite complaining about everything 24/7.
90% of all issues in Korea stem from mindset / cultural issues, rather than pure economy or X Y Z hardship, despite what the western media would have you believe, they constantly misunderstand the true reason behind many of these issues.
Multiple factors contributing to this.
Poor parental leave policies, cost of having a kid, longest working hours among OECD countries (I.e., no time or energy to have sex and take care of kids), not enough financial incentives from governmentand women not wanting to be baby machines.
This is just a sample of why South Koreans are not having enough babies.
This normally wouldn't be a big problem if immigration policies were looser (e.g., Canada has 500,000 immigrants a year, leading to population growth even though Canadians are having below replacement-level birth rates).
But SK has strict immigration policies.
