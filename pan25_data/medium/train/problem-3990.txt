It's so aggravating having states focus on boutique weed growers when they could easily just change the regulations around it to benefit small businesses and people who want to grow it themselves.
They could implement corporate tax brackets if they really wanted to help small businesses be more competitive.
One of the biggest things I take issue with in California is that cities ban growing it outside.
It's a damn plant, just let me garden and many people would be self sufficient.
Even just legalizing it will bring down prices dramatically which helps minorities more than making sure small businesses can succeed.
Marijuana in California is dirt cheap now.
Worrying about boutique weed growers is focusing on the wrong priorities.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
