No, Israel was invaded in1967 and the aggressor Jordan was pushed back.
Jordan gave up on the West Bank leaving a power vacuum that necessitated the occupation to keep the Palestinian population from continuing the war.
In the Oslo Accords, the Palestinians agreed to terms to seperate the West bank into 3 zones with Zone C being sparcely populated and overseen by Israeli military was intended to be up for negotiations to determine the exact borders.
The Palestinians rejected all peace proposals, did not provide counter-proposals and started the second intifada consisting of suicide bombers and deadly attacks on Israeli civilians.
This forced Israel to build the separation wall which drastically reduced the attacks.
Its now about two decades later and the Palestinians have rejected other peace agreement proposals and are taking the strategy of continuing a decades old war that they lost in 1967 with no end in sight.
Israelis tired of the killings and unwillingness for Palestinians to seek peace have shifted from a moderate government to a more hawkish/right one as a result.
Israel sees no point in waiting for Palestinians to negotiate peace to determine borders from a defensive war they won, so they are expanding their settlements in Area C, the area that they believe is negotiable for them to receive in a peace agreement.
So, I donâ€™t see this as anything close to resembling the Russian invasion of Ukraine since Russia is the aggressor (like Jordan in 1967) and Israel should be allowed to continue participation in the Olympics.
If anyone wants to see a really eye opening documentary, that shows how Russia goes to extraordinary and excessive lenhs to cheat in the Olympics, I highly recommend a documentary on Netflix, named 'Icarus'.
The circumstances that led the main guy in the documentary to stumble into perhaps the biggest sports scandal of all time, were pretty crazy.
