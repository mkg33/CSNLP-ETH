Life is so different and moves at such a different pace in Thailand.
I fail to understand how the West can happily continue to use animal labour (horses, cattle, donkeys, pigeons, and what have you) and find it so appalling that we use monkeys to harvest coconuts.
Just because it shocks you that an animal you find exotic (yet very common in a different part of the world) is put to work doesn’t mean it’s anymore wrong compared to using a horse to pull carriages all fucking day (happening as we speak in many cities in Canada and all across the western world).
Please explain to me the logic behind this; I’m genuinely curious to know how this is triggering?
Is it just angering vegans or are we proposing putting an end to all animal labour, or is this just the usual double standard set by the uprising overly “woke” culture?
While I understand they should strive to be better, the problem is much larger than a food delivery service.
I've been using that brand for years (assuming it's the one I am familiar with), before hellofresh was popular in the US.
So, I guess I'm not much better..
