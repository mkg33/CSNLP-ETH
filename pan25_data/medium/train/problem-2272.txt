I'm confused.
I've just google map'ed Uzbekistan, and they don't even share a border with Russia.
They're past Kazakhstan.
To get to Uzbekistan, Russians have to go through Kazakhstan.
Am I correct in undersstanding that Russians feel the need to be two countries away from Russia?
edit: also this is a great opportunity for you to look at Kazakhstan on a map and/or wikipedia it.
You can learn a lot in 30 seconds of research.
A draft dodger is someone avoiding the draft.
Russian citizens are going to other countries so they don't have to fight in Ukraine.
Kazakhstan is a neighboring country to Russia, which makes it convenient to flee to.
Naturally, there is spillover of fleeing Russians from Kazakhstan to Uzbekistan.
This is just people not staying in the first place they fled to.
Maybe due to a lack of refugee space considering the hundred thousand or two that are already at the first country of entry.
It’s a fallacy that refugees should stay in the first safe country they get to.
This places an undue burden on the closest countries to a troubled country.
Dispersal is better.
If every Russian draft-dodger goes to close countries that Russia influences, Russia can put pressure to get them back.
If dispersed, it’s not so easy.
