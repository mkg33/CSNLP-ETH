Lessee here, we invade Ukraine because they are Nazis and they stink.
It's only gonna take 3 days.
Then it takes a month.
Then we get driven back, but all accoring to plan.
Then a callup, 300,000 men.
Major mass exodus.
Then the bottom falls out of our economy.
Then more callups.
Many families in the area have lost a husband, a son.
And now bombs falling.
At what point do we wise up and rise up?
?
As russian I wish for putin good health so he can spend every last of his days in a jail cell.
So he can see everything taken away from the people he cares for, if they exist.
So he can see Ukraine emerging from this nightmare which he brought upon its lands, I want him to see how russia might be a part of developed world under a good leadership.
So when his time comes, he will think to himself how little he did for what he was trusted.
But alas, donâ€™t think he will ever understand how much he had, how much he took from people.
Slava Ukraine.
Wasting actual war resources to protect the guy who is incompetently dumping russia into the latrine pit.. you love to see it!
