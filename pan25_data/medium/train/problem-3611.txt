It should be noted for the Americans here that in Australia the liberal party are the conservatives.
The have shifted too far right and are loosing the elections badly.
Well, in this case the word liberal and conservative are being used wrong, because they are not political labels.
The party names are the political labels open to changing definitions, not the terms conservative and liberal.
Using the word liberal to try to mean traditionalist is nothing by a disinformation attempt or sheer ignorance.
Those words have real meanings beyond politics and that's why they are useful, they span time while the labels flip flop.
It's like trying to redefine the word Hydrogen to mean Uranium and then saying well that's my choice.
NO ITS FUCKING NOT!
The words have specific meanings in this case and can't really be used like that.
That's why we have party labels like Republican and Democratic or Tory and Labor.
Those terms can change over time, the terms liberal and conservative cannot.
You can just look like an idiot who doesn't understand those are not labels, but DEFINITIONS of behavior.
It's like you can't change the meaning of the word angry to mean happy and expect that to be realistic position to hold.
Liberal and conservative are supposed to mean is liberal means new ideas and conservative means traditional.
That's the SINGLE binding point of meaning that makes those terms matter.
That's why you have labels like Democratic and Republicans, so the labels can switch but the core ideological terms don't.
You can't be a conservative liberal, you're just using the words wrong at that point because you can't be pro-tradition and pro-progress.
Like Abraham Lincoln was a Republican, but he was a liberal and Andred Jackson was a Democratic, but back when Dems were the conservatives.
WHY would you switch the core words around too, that's just EVIL!
