That is excellent news.
These illegal miners does not give damn about harming indigenous inhabitants or polluting surrounding area so no mercy should be given to them.
>“This operation hasn’t come a moment too soon,” Sarah Shenker, the head of the non-profit Survival International in Brazil, said in a statement.
“It’s absolutely vital that the authorities get the miners out, and keep them out.
They’ve blighted the Yanomami’s lives for far too long, and have caused untold misery and destruction.
Even if all of them are removed, and they can be kept out, it will take years for the Yanomami and their rainforest to recover.”.
