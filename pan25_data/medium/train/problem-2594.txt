was thinking the same thing, its been an open secret for years that she isn't exactly all there mentally anymore yet she still kept running and winning reelection.
She will be very fortunate if she even lives to see this summer, let alone through the end of 2024.
She is probably seriously physically ill (as well as mentally out to lunch) but the party is just hiding that fact from voters to help her save face.
I know sheâ€™s 90 but her appearance in that photo is shocking!
She looks so very, very sick & frail, even by geriatric standards.
My only easily findable memory of her was lambasting a group of kids who came to see her about climate change and saying she knows what's she's doing that they don't know anything.
I mean she was pretty with it even back then and she basically tells kids government isn't there to help them and they're all fucked.
What's the point of a legacy that ends in nothing good done.
Abortion fell under her watch just like Pelosi's.
30 years in government and she never pushed for actual laws protecting abortion.
I respect that she got into a position that was hard, haven't seen a great accomplishment from her as far as laws or progress though.
Just usual corporate stooging that a lot of the DNC tends to do.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
