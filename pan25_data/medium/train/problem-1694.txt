No, I think he invaded because biden is weak and we are overstretched.
We have US troops being deployed in Poland and Eastern Europe, for Ukraine which is NOT a geopolitical priority of the U.S. We also botch our Afghan withdrawal, are being pressed by the Chinese in the South China Sea, have North Korea beginning to renew agression, have further alienated our Saudi Allie’s and have renewed deployments in Africa.
That plus the economic basket case is all on Biden.
Trump wouldn’t have pushed us into the Ukraine bullshit, and would have concentrated on fixing our economy and keeping our fuel prices as low as possible.
We are in a situation where one misstep gets us into a major war.
That’s all Biden.
In my mind that's the craziest thing.
Saudi's army is pretty much entirely made up of mercenaries from around the world.
Like how does that even work?
Aren't they constantly scared of mutiny?
Couldn't these mercenaries, which are their military just take over the country?
How do they keep these people from starting a revolution?
I just don't understand and am amazed at it's functioning.
