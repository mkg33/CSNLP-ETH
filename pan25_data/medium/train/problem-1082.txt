This has been tried in multiple countries, at least for bottles and cans.
It works great.
Where I live there is an 8c refund on glass bottles and 25c on plastic and aluminium cans.
Guess what, you never see any of those things on the ground anywhere.
Seriously, I smoked for years and I detested people who threw them on the ground outside my job.
If someone was smoking with me and they threw theirs I would check them.
100,000 years is nothing in the grand scheme of things but that doesn't mean it doesn't feel like forever.
I would guess a reasonable person would consider under a year go be highly biodegradable.
12-15 years is a really long time for trash to sit there.
Very cool.
An apple is highly biodegrabable.
Something that takes 15 years isn't.
10 000 years is nothing in the grand scheme of things either and we wouldn't refer to something that takes 10 000 to be highly-biodegradable.
The reason the big corporations oppose and lobby against refund schemes like this is precisely because they lead more people to see things like you do and ask 'why isn't mcdonalds responsible for the garbage their business generates?'.
It is simply not a good look for the company if suddenly people start blaming them.
