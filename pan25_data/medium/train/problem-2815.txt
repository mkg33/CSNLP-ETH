Soldiers follow the orders.
They are not average Russian they are soldiers this regime feed them, they owes to the regime.
Average Russian is a plumber or teacher who thinks exclusively about his family.
What you describe is war.
In war, there are war crimes, and those will be solved, and guilty will be punished.
I hope.
I am an average Russian, and I do not support this war, but I can't just go to the Red Square claim that I am against my government because they'll put me in prison.
I have a family that depends on me.
At this point, I believe putin is in his fuck everybody phase.
He can get a new girlfriend, he can make new kids, he can find a new country, but he has to protect himself, in his eyes that is the one this that isn't expendable.
I'm in the .1% and I'm not his family or friend.
Putin lives in his own Russia that has nothing with real Russia.
Average Russian, like other people in whatever country, just want to live in peace and tranquility.
From Buffalo NY, USA, and I completely agree with your peace and tranquility.
Hope we all get it soon.
There's plenty of things to fight against, no reason to fight each other.
