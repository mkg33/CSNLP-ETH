Pulling this number from probably 20 years ago, but I had a teacher tell us that if an average person did not die from disease or age, then the average age would go up to 500 based on current chance of dying in an accident.
oddly enough i had a college professor who said something similar, he said that no one would live past 1200 years because by then the chance that war or accident kills would have approached 100%.
First, if you're not aging, you have less accidents.
Many accidents are caused or exacerbated by reduced reaction times and maybe even faulty situation assessment.
Second, if you're blessed with the unaging body of a 30 years old, you are less likely to die from most accidents.
Sure you WILL die in many situations anyways, but it shifts the statistics.
Third, without the certainty that death will come anyways, many ppl will likely reduce risky behavior, at least until they are sick of life, which may actually happen.
There are probably more issues to consider.
Overall it's a classical problem when you apply currently valid statistics to an imaginary, dramatically altered situation.
