China's state broadcaster is cutting close-up shots of maskless fans at the Qatar World Cup, after early coverage sparked anger at home where street protests have erupted over harsh Covid-19 restrictions.
Biggest prize CCP gave itself was probably Tea Eminem Square "Riot Squelch" - there is an entire floor waiting for the biggest award though, simply called "Taiwan all ours now".
The most coveted of all awards, except maybe for the 'Jan.
6 "Follow my lead" award' which takes time to receive because of first needing to serve time.
And lets not forget when the womens World Cup team only lost to the USA because the entire team was struck by lightning.
Bad luck there.
Hey look at these stupid Chinese, don't they know the pandemic is over?
These people are living in denial.
Scary how propaganda can create a fake reality.
People and institutions sure do behave like they believe the pandemic is over.
And PR is just a different word for propaganda.
We're so advanced over here we don't fall for propaganda like those brainwashed Chinese masses, right?
Our media never leaves inconvenient information out of their news reports I'm sure.
