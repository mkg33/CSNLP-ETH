So if a teacher decides they need to get something for their classroom, they get a tax rebate at the end of the year that essentially pays for it.
If this goes into effect, I have a feeling that a lot of Oklahoma teachers will be leaving to Colorado and Hawaii in a New York Minute.
But Republicans paying teachers would actually contradict their intent.
If they value teachers instead of blaming them for all societies and calling them lazy for "having 3 months off" (which we don't get paid by the way), how will Republican panic work?
It's something like $250 tax rebate when teachers spend easily $1000s for stuff for their classrooms.

Please if you have any questions or concerns.

I'm talking about all the things they get for their classroom that is extra.
Maybe the teacher wants to buy some books to better their in class library.
