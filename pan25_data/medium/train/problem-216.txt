The state house is made up of several representatives from a series of districts, and each district can have anywhere between 1 and 11 representatives.
There are 400 seats and 204 districts.
I'm pretty sure that the districts subdivide within the town lines, meaning each town basically gets at least one representative, and larger cities get several districts with at least one representative.
The multimember districts often result in mixed-party representation.
