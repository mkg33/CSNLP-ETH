People keep calling Russia fascist- invader- warmonger, some of it might be true to some extent, although Russians have different point of view.
But mostly i have seen that Russia as a country has always respected india as a sovereign country and understood the reason behind its decisions on the other hand western countries have always tried to force India to take decisions only in its favour disregarding complexities that india faces.
If india doesn't follow through they slap other woke terms on India and demean it's stand.
I haven't seen russia ever do this.
Well that’s probably because Russia is lacking basic morals.
I’m not saying the west is always right but considering how many westerners have died defending human rights around the world, I’d say it’s fair to hold other countries up on doing what they can as well.
They dgaf about India or Indians, your average Russian would even want tot talk with them, all they want is the money and get away with being the new nazis.
Get your info straight and wake up.
