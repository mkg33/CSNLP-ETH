>Iran vows to avenge Qassem Soleimani’s killing three years ago murder more of it's own people for speaking out while it tries to distract them with useless vendettas that won't help them in the slightest...
It's like listening to a five year old try to manipulate you... "America is the devil so please don't overthrow the government that keep killing all it's own kids.
".
Wasn't that what the missile attack on the US base in Iraq was for?
And the subsequent murder of 176 people on board Ukraine International Airlines flight 752?
Seriously it's been 3 years since an American drone blew up a terrorist mastermind at the Baghdad Airport just move along.
They also claimed to have killed Ayatollah Mike in a plane crash, although the plain did not appear to be shot down and no evidence was ever shown that he was either on the plane or had died, and the photo Iran used in their propaganda promoting all this was actor Fredric Lehne from the movie Zero Dark Thirty instead of the real Mike D’Andrea.
But what can you expect from a lying murderous self serving regime who kills the young girls of their own people for not wearing cloth over their face?
