And a boycott is the right thing to do regardless of if it changes the situation.
It's as much about who we are as ethical beings.
I think at some point, when something is this dominant, you have to make a decision based less on "What can I and the people I know do to influence this event so that it's done right?"
(because the odds are that you're not going to be able to stop or change one of the biggest sporting and broadcast events in the world), and instead ask, "Is the entertainment that I get from watching and taking part in this worth the suffering that it seems to impose on so many other people?"
Which is an equally difficult question to answer.
Because it's abstract and entirely an ethical one.
And it's really fucking fun watching World Cup football, and those people negatively affected tend to be rather far away.
But I think that everyone should at least ask it of themselves, maybe struggle with it, and live with the answer.
It’s something tho, and it’s better than nothing, good on them for taking a stand.
For many countries, the World Cup is the biggest stage they will ever have a chance of participating in.
To take a stand like that is damn admirable.
I wouldn't expect much result sadly Qatar is a compounding factor but FIFA is as corrupt as they come.
We should be boycotting the world cup before Qatar were even announced let alone after.
Most fans will turn a blind eye because they're ignorant and or don't care as it doesn't affect them yet.
