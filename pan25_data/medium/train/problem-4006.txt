It also needs to be noted that china is 20% of the worlds population.
And they are in full on outbreak and they are not providing accurate information and have a history of hiding information as your article alluded too.
They are a huge risk of a variant.
Just by demographics and the number of people sick alone.
I don’t think that at the height of any other countries outbreaks they would let any flight leave the country with half the people sick.
It just comes off as reckless.
Because Chinese culture is all about saving face.
This is utterly embarrassing.
Especially because there's a growing list of major countries all focusing on China and its COVID-19 problem.
As an ethnically Chinese, I don’t think that’s it.
The people vocal about this do not feel shame, or they’ve numbed themselves to it for the money.
This is them doing the wolf warrior diplomacy thing, behaving like rabid dogs to project strenh.
You might say it just makes them look weak, but it makes sense to the angsty mentality fostered by Chinese society.
