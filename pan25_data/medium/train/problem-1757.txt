I live there.
It’s not an open border.
I can drive to the crossing point right now and wait in line and if I have the appropriate documents I can cross back and forth.
The armed guards ensure that I have the right documents for international travel.
It’s easier to get out than to get in, but I wouldn’t call either a walk in the park.
The crossing points themselves are kind of ugly.
You wouldn’t vacation there.
If I try to cross between points I risk death or detention specifically because it’s not an open border.
There’s National Guard patrolling the border.
CBP.
Some individual “militia.” Crazy yahoos with guns.
There’s not a moat patrolled by sharks with lasers strapped to their heads but that’s not the standard of what makes a border open or closed, is it?
This is a huge deal, and I would assume due to the pressures of the recent protests.
You can have all the lockdowns you want until 200 million military age men and women say "enough".
I would imagine that this is an effort to avoid that happening.
