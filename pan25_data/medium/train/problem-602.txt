People with hyperactive fear responses more readily see outsiders/others as a threat, and insecurity often leads to wanting to put others down as a way of raising themselves up.
Both of these defensive psychological traits make conservatives really easy to emotionally manipulate and are willing to accept falsehoods.
Something which has been widely researched and clearly demonstrated throughout history - up to and including during every election cycle.
Similar manipulation is also commonly observable in day to day marketing.
Better, we need to tamp down on radicalization, propaganda and willful manipulation of vulnerable people.

In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
