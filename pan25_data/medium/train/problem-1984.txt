Just look at America and how many women are anti-choice.
There are always people who try to further the oppression of their own kind because it's what they were indoctrinated to believe (or because they're simply hateful).
>“This lady wants to go out in this outfit… it’s none of my business,” the officer is heard saying in response to a woman asking him to confront another woman for not wearing the hijab.
As an ex-muslim, I always get annoyed when western muslims come at me with their "hijab is a choice" bs.
How can hijab be a choice when girls as young as 6 or 7 are indoctrinated into thinking that they'll go to hell for showing two strands of their hair!
The new minister on combatting Islamophobia in Canada has only mentioned Iran once during all this and it’s to whine that the protests and fight for rights in Iran may cause people to “take it out on Muslims in Canada”.
Why is there even a minister to combat islamophobia?
Is there a minister to combat homophobia?
Is there a minister to combat christainphobia, jewphobia, hinduphobia, etc.
