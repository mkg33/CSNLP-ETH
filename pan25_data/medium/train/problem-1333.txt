I haven't researched it myself, so grain of salt, but one potential problem would have been storage.
If at the time the strategic reserve was more or less full, then there wouldn't have been anywhere to put more oil even if it were cheap.
At one point the price of oil went negative, not because anyone thought it was inherently worthless but because everyone had run out of places to put it so they just physically couldn't buy more.
Biden doesn't have this problem because he just sold a bunch and is just replacing it.

Obviously there are costs involved in buying, selling, and transporting the oil but it would be amazing irony if Biden racked up a huge profit doing what Republicans complained about.
