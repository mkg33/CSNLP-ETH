"A Gallup poll conducted from January to July 2022 found that 30 percent of Gen X identified as Republican while 44 percent were independent—the highest proportion of independent voters in any generational block.
And Gen X doesn’t actually seem to be aging into conservatism either; in fact, it’s the opposite: In 1992, Gallup found that adult members of Gen X were even more likely to identify as Republicans than Democrats, 32 percent to 24 percent.
So really, Gen Xers have swung a little more toward the Democratic party over time (now 27 percent identify as Dems).
