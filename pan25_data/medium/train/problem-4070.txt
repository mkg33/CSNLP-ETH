So let's blame a failed state on the opinions of outside observers.
Who do you expect to solve this problem if not the people of Iran?
Are you on the side of blaming the condition of Iran over the last 20 or more years on its prior affiliation with colonial powers.
Does that explain every condition of failed states?
Is that the cause of oppression everywhere?
The solution lies in the people of Iran taking control.
It relies on the elite and the educated on remaining in Iran and facing the problems instead of fleeing to Western countries.
And the same goes with Russia and other places.
You don't solve world problems by leaving your brothers and sisters behind to deal with tyranny and fight that tyranny by holding signs in the streets and yelling death to the dictator.
I am sorry you don't like my opinion.
Don't you understand that shit will never get any traction your way, you won't unite a majority being so one-track-minded?
Humans are too complex and there are many of us now.
Why not change pace and strategy to be more agreeable to find a happy medium for you and your fellow countrymen?
