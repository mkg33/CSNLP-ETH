Actually, in some ways, the Constitution did have protections against an actively destructive populace.
The Founders, while fans of Democracy, were not all believers in the intelligence of portions of the population.
The Electoral College was not designed to consider a popular vote in each state.
The original intention was that State Legislatures would choose the Electors to determine the Presidency.
Also, prior to the 17th Amendment, US Senators were selected by their State Legislatures.
The Founders intended these institutions to safeguard against the raucous whims of the people.
The House was intended as "the peoples' house," not because of any populist sentiment, but simply to ensure that there was a group representing random voters.
That being said, in those days, the vote only belonged to white men, often only those who owned land.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
