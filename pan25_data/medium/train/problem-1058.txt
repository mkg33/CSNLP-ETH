Instead of using this opportunity to spread conspiracy theories you may have used it as a moment of self reflection to realise that in a war both sides lie very shamelessly, but that would take some reflection instead of mindless propaganda regurgitation.
Ukraine denies it for the same reason Russia denies everything bad it does: because both countries are actually very little different culturally and react very similarly to similar situations, such as taking responsibility for fuck ups.
I'm second gen American and one side of my family is from what was once Galicia in the border region of Poland and Ukraine.
Since borders fluctuated so much in that area in the last century, my family says we're "Polish-Ukrainian."
I am so proud of my ancestral countries and how Poland has supported its neighbor Ukraine.
Both know all too well about neighboring powers invading for natural resources, etc.
(And Latvia and the other countries in the region that have been bravely standing up to Russia and supporting Ukraine are bros for sure!
).
