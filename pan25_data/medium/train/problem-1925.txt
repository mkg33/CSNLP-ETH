I do agree with the charge for admin things (freedom of info etc) maybe also copies of notes (disability reasons aside).
But they’ve already paid through taxation.
Possibly more than others.
The answer to this isn’t to charge the wealthy more like it’s some sort of panacea for an immensely complex problem, the answer comes from asking the right questions.
Who has the greatest utilisation of healthcare (spoiler alert - not the rich)?
It’s people with chronic conditions: diabetes, heart disease, COPD.
What leads to these issues?
Lack of education, and a socioeconomic landscape that disproportionately leads to people from poorer backgrounds making health related decisions that increase their likelihood to suffer from these conditions and their catastrophic, i.e.
costly, consequences.
Some answers; supply side economic policy - tax soft drink companies, tax fast food, tax everyone’s favourite chronic hepatotoxin - sugar.
Reduce the cost of healthy alternatives.
Education.
More doctors and consultants, better access to imaging (MR, X-ray), leveraging the expertise of physios, OTs, nurses in managing complex patients (but actually training them, not just dropping them in it like poor FCPs in GP practices).
I could go on, but like everyone else in the NHS, what would be the fucking point.
And also missed appointments.
It seems people CAN take it for granted, I have been brought up to never, and couldn't imagine missing an appointment, never mind with a Dr.
I know the NHS and non clinical staff.
I've had enough run ins with them as a healthcare professional.
I've served on CCG committees and the tricks they pull are disgraceful.
These are non clinicians I'm talking about and not those on the front line.
This will only be the start.
Please do not go down this road as it will destroy the NHS and its brilliant concept.
