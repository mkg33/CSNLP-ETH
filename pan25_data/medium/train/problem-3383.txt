Alex jones was convicted by an American court; these men by a Dutch court.
They are operating under vastly different legal systems.

The convicted men, two Russian former intelligence officers and a Ukrainian separatist leader, were also ordered to pay at least 16 million euros ($16.5 million) in compensation to relatives of the victims.
