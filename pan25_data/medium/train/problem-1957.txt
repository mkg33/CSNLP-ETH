Voting is not the cure-all in this situation.
I wish I knew how to fix the problem.
I love my state, but short of a massive influx of people willing to move out to the middle of absolutely nowhere, we're fucked on a state level.
The state of Georgia has a population of about 10 million.
There are 159 counties in Georgia, the second highest number of any state in the country.
Over 30% of the state's population lives in the three largest counties (Fulton, Gwinnett, Cobb).
There are 34 counties with less than 10,000 residents.
.
Counties were created for the explicit purpose of gaining votes to drown out urban votes from Atlanta.
