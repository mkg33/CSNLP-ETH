Exactly, their brains short circuit when you have zero hesitation in saying “investigate and arrest her/him/them, then.
If Nancy Pelosi broke the law, prosecute her.
If Hunter Biden broke the law, prosecute him.”.

Please if you have any questions or concerns.
I dont like Biden.
I just voted for him to help get that spray tanned monster out of office.
But the right seems to think attacking Biden is going to wound us like the bunch of snowflakes they think we are.
They put Biden stickers on gas pumps because they're certain we're going to rage and throw a fit.
They attacked Clinton for four years during Trumpty's presidency even though no one on the left gave a shit.
They literally can’t comprehend that most of us are not insanely biased in favor of the politicians we vote for when it comes o CRIME.
They are certain anyone who voted for Biden must worship him...
I honestly don't know anyone who particularly likes the guy and I live in a pretty liberal area.
