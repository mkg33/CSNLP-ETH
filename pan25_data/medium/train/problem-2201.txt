Putin's gamble has to be one of the worst calls in recent history.
It went from "you can't survive without us" to "you don't like us?
well how about you now have to pay us for gas in rubles" to "we are cutting gas exports so you freeze this winter."
to "I guess you don't have to pay for it in rubles" to "where did everyone go?
".
That’s gas.
Oil is entering terminal decline now too.
22% of car sales in China were electric in 2022 and this year it will be 33% or more.
Europe is going in the same direction.
There will be more than enough capacity elsewhere to cut Russia off and they don’t have much more to offer.
Russias decline is going to be like the fall of the USSR, it’s just going to take a few years.
Forcing the EU to find other suppliers and diversify and has cost Russia it's most powerful bargaining tool.
That's how you know he isn't some master strategist.
You never let your biggest consumers find out that they can do just fine without you.
I like the way you think but it seems unlikely that the world is going to break its dependence on oil.
Tanker ships, cars for the exploding middle class in Africa, and so much else will need oil for the foreseeable.
We will still need oil, my point was just that oil sales will continue to go down and down.
Vehicle sales are concentrated in Europe, USA and China for the most part and electric car sales are going to take a larger and larger share of that market.
