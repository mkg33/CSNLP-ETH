I saw "In the Same Breath" documentary, and it told that they censored the COVID news since the beginning of the pandemic.
I guess the VPN crackdown is the new thing.
It was always illegal before but I understand they usually let it slide, only punishing the VPN violation if you did something they did not like.
That's the thing about the law in China, lots of things are illegal but everyone looks the other way (for a fee) until it affects someone in power.
Then there's a crackdown and anyone who isn't politically well positioned gets stepped on.
It's like Russia with the corruption and theft, no?
Everyone always has something they are doing they could be busted for, but are being specifically ignored, for a time.
One of the most interesting stories told was the Chinese people want freedom of speech because the China government limits COVID information.
At the same time the USE government (in this case Trump) use the freedom of speech right to spread misinformation for its people.
Oh the irony.
