What a horror story for these two young people.
I had a couple Iranian friends In Los Angeles, the father would get so upset about the direction Iran was going, he would yell at anyone who'd listen:.
Stop them, they are crazy, they'll kill anyone that gets in their way.
He called me into his office one afternoon, took a very large pile of 100 dollar bills, split it in half, other half in his safe, took out a knife and cut a big slit in the liner of the suitcase and stuffed it full of countless hundred dollar bills, sealed the cut, he said watch my office, I'll only be gone a day, what I asked?, I'm taking all this money to Iranian Resistance people I know, I'll be back tomorrow night.
And he was, with no suit case full of money.
They are being arrested for filming it and making a public statement against the regime.
That’s actually far worse than the official reasons… the regime tortures political prisoners in horrific ways.
It’s because they are scared of the people, who mostly hate them.
