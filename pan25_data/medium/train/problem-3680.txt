The same Boris Johnson who slipped his security to party with the son of a KGB agent and then got so drunk in their presence he forgot what they were talking about?
The same Boris Johnson who kept jetting over to Ukraine every time he faced a difficult political situation domestically and basically used Ukraine as a giant prop to distract from all the things he fucked up?
The same Boris Johnson who handed our a peerage to someone with Russian ties?
That one?
Yeah, France was.
Macron thought he could actually negotiate with a ruzzian and solve things diplomatically, and came out looking real stupid when he tried to claim war was being avoided, just for it to break out like a week later.
I think it might be the same Boris Johnson who accepted buckets of Russian oligarch money to cheer on Brexit which turned into a massive clusterfuck for the UK, just as the stay side said it would.
I never understood why Boris is so popular in Ukraine.
Well on a base level I do but any research into his past shows dodgy deals with Russians for decades.
