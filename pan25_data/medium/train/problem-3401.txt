Mainly because we were initially looking for fire extinguishers to put out the first fire.
When we got them, the entire side of the humvee was on fire.
We all looked at it and said "oh shit.
That ammo is gonna start cooking off.
We should get out of here."
Hell the KBR fire department looked at it and said "we ain't going anywhere near that until that ammo is cooked off.
".
I think one of two things happened.
Either someone trolled a Wikipedia page since we know Russia uses that for military stuff or someone is about to fall out of a window again.
Alright, can someone explain to me how can a storage point full of explosive stuff blow up for that long?
Did something blow up and create fire that spread around for 20 hours - lighting up more and more stuff that can blow up?
That's usually how it works.
We had a rocket hit next to one of our vehicles in Baghdad that set the side of one of them on fire.
The fire spread on the truck, and it started cooking off the ammo, which set the next truck in fire, then the next, then the next.
Fire and cook-off lasted a couple of hours.
The next morning, all that was left was the frames.
