While I've gotten all the single player trophies (on 4 different platforms lol), for the platinum you have to play a truly overwhelming amount of the truly awful, and now 10-year-old, multiplayer mode.
I am really not having a good time.
It's finally Friday!
That means it's time to sit back, watch some low-stakes streaming comedy in the background, argue about the best variety of brassica oleracea (I'm partial to brussels sprouts), and talk about whatever your heart desires.
I'm at 98 platinum trophies now on PlayStation and have decided that 100 will be something special - one of my all time favorite video games and my favorite one playable on PS4/5, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag.
I am not sure why but it seems like there are no Levi’s jeans that are not made of stretch material out there anymore.
Whenever I’ve gone on the website for a specific type, 527 slim boot cuts, it’s always stretch fabric, which loosens so much, and I don’t think they make the good ones anymore, it’s irritating, and the times I have tried to get some on sites like Poshmark, the sellers never respond or are dead accounts that don’t mail them.
I don’t know, just feel wound up all of a sudden, want the workday over, feel like packing up my bags for a trip I am taking in late March already.
Edit, did listen to Chulahoma by the Black Keys on headphones, that helped.
