You have that wrong buddy: the majority of the rail union workers voted against ratifying the agreement on the table.
Once the agreement was rejected, the rail refused to negotiate further forcing the adoption of the rejected contract.
That's why this strike was proposed.
The main thing that the workers fought for was a few days of unpaid sick leave.

Please if you have any questions or concerns.
There are plenty of democrats that work on the railroad.
Regardless, we know the Republicans were going to be against unions.
Democrats showed they aren't much better.
Not sure where you're getting this idea that majority of the workers preferred the agreement on the table but that is not how unions work.
