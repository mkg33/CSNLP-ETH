>Betty (Get Money) is Yung Gravy's most successful track to date, reaching gold status in the US, equating to 500,000 sales.
The song and its accompanying video were released in June 2022.
Why would he have heard the song?
Gravy paid the writers of the song, Stock Aitken Waterman, not Rick.
You're not hearing his voice, that's an imitation.
I understand that it’s not his voice, but it’s his melody and such that he’s had a lot of success with.
I just feel like before it was released he heard it, if nothing more than to essentially approve it or be the first to hear Gravy’s version since he did use Rick’s song.
It looks like Gravy licensed the composition of the song and imitated Rick Astley without his involvement.
That's a TikTok/music streaming thing.
Videos are short so the main content of the song can be short too.
Also if the song is shorter it can be listened through more times.
I listened to the song before I read the whole article, and I thought the singing at the start was Rick Astley.
