if it's anything like 99 year loans to countries in Africa china will be handing out expensive stuff like candy, with tons of clauses and all, and as soon as the country they're using the thing in fails to pay their dues in some way or another china snags something, let it be land or gold or whatever they want from that country.
nope it's currency did I hit my head, they're going to give them 45B yuan if I read correctly which isn't much @6.6B - basically doubles Argentina's foreign currency reserves.
