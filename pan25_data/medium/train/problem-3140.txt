The way this news item pops up every day for over a week makes it sound like they find more and more documents every time they look under Biden's mattress.
It appears from the article the reason this resurfaced is because Bidens representatives intentionally involved the DOJ in the process when they found documents.
Which means the earlier article was finding the initial document, then Bidens people halted the search and involved the DOJ to perform the rest of the search which led to this finding.
Of course, that context and willingness to involve the DOJ in the search seems to elude the headlines somehow.
