Another Redditor commented Navalny may be trying to earn "street cred" with the prison gangs as well as the general public (as a Nelson Mandela-esque political prisoner) which will position him well should Putin be forced to step down (either voluntarily or coup or death) and leadership of Russia becomes up for grabs.
I think Yashin has said that there’s no way Putin is going to be in power 8 and a half years from now, so he’s not worried about having to be in jail for that long.
Yashin is a very very brave man.
And an honest, sincere and intelligent one.
I hope these 8.5 years will turn out to be not more than a year or two.
But this hope is bleak.
I'd love to see how long you would last in a country like Russia.
Your ignorance to the nuance of the situation that many anti-Russians in that country are in tells me you would be on of the earliest to join Putin's clapping circle.
But I largely agree with you in the case of this guy, Yashin.
I don't see this as a political power play for him.
Just a miscalculation perhaps, although a brave one at that.
