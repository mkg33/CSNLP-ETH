John Oliver did a really smart piece on this independent contractor scam.
It keeps truckers from being able to unionize and have real negotiation power.
Is that how that works?
People strike with the permission of the employer, and the employer can just be like nah fam, get back to work?
Because I don't think that's how strikes work.
Yeah, good luck with that.
I'm sure they'll be really happy to be back at the same shit conditions they rallied against in the first place and eager to give 110%.
