I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
I can’t wait for the GOP primary season to start.
I assume both lead candidates sit on enormous cash piles.
This should be a bloodbath ( figuratively spoken).
But make no mistake.
Who ever comes out on top will take the whole prize.
They won’t just not vote for the Republican.
Whoever wins will leave with the full support of everyone.
They will all fall in line.
That's the dream scenario.
After Trump testifies against Charlie Kirk and 20 or 30 House Republicans to keep himself out of jail, he goes on the campaign trail.
Charlie kirk helped him with his insurrection.
But if Trump is convicted, he could give testimony against all the people who helped him with the insurrection.
So people like Kirk and Alex Jones and all those republican congressman.
Look what they did to John McCain.
Guy was a fighter pilot and the second he didn’t bend the knew he was a traitor to them.
Who ever wins the crown will win the crown.
They’ll fall in line.
If that moron runs as a 3rd party without having won the fight they’ll turn on him.
