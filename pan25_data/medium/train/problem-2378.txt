The only Russian patriots are the ones who have been protesting.
Nothing but respect for Navalny, Litvinenko, Politkovskaya, Estemirova, Pussy Riot, and others, who have been protesting him for years and suffered greatly for their efforts (3 of them are dead).
These are great Russians!
Putin has a very high approval rating and has, his entire career as President and Prime Minister.
It's been above 75% more than it's been under 75%.
And I don't think it's ever dipped below 50%.
He's always been quite popular because of his image of being strong and, at least until recently, doing a fairly good job at giving the people (mainly Russians, I suspect) enough money to make them not feel poor.
Also what about the YABLOKO Party which remains in the russian political system but is running on a "end this" program and before the war advocated for the return of Crimea and leaving the Donbass and westernizing russia??
They are pacifists and are old, but they are the ones that gave a voice to quite a few of the current protesters (navalny started as a member but got kicked out for participating in far right rallies causing him to still hate them nowadays, but many others had more peaceful memberships).
Russian people who don't accept what the Russian army/Wagner are doing in Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine and parts of Africa at this very moment are a huge problem, as Russia is the most populous country in Europe and has never moved past the expansionist mindset that gained it so much land in the 1940s, some of which it still has (the Southern Kurils, northern East Prussia and Finnish Karelia, and all that land it is trying to eat of Ukraine's this very year).
