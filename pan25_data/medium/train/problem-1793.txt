I've been trying to find out.
It's well-known that r/Canada is managed by r/Metacanada incels and miscreants.
They have offered no comment on whether their mod roster has included this shithead, or other incel shitheads like Alek Minassian, Jordan Daniel Goggin, and Neng Jia Jin.
They've been dead quiet.
Can I be real.. this was for sure a thing.
There was that "controversy over a poorly banned post" which led r/canada to run a 24 hour hasty new mod election which led to many verifiable metacanadian power users.
You are right.
This was what, 7 years ago or something?
Sure felt like a quiet coup.
But have you even tried worshiping their one true god?
It's all Trudeau's fault is the god that keeps on giving, can't get a date, It's all Trudeau's fault, bad with money, it's all Trudeau's fault, someone complains about your personal hygiene, it's all Trudeau's fault, this is the r/Canada religion.
Thing is, metacanada splintered themselves with intense infighting as with many alt right groups lately, and i feek r canada feels like it returned slowly to its milquetoast state with less drama.
But would definitely appreciate insights and always recommend mixing it up with other canada subs anyway.
