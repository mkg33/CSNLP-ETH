In other news Iranian officials say that protestors will be murdered and the beatings issued by the "Morality" Police will continue until morale improves.
Yes, it's Israel and it's allies murdering Irans girls and teenage protesters.
Who knew that Israel had the power to vote in Iranian parliament to give almost 15,000 arrested protestors the death penalty... Iran's leadership is a f@cking sick joke and deserves to be torn down by it's own people.
Civil war?
I think the word they're looking for is revolution... F@ck all theocracies.
Ah yes, threatening to execute 1,500 citizens for 'protesting' is definitely better than 15,000...
I don't care if it's one, the number isn't what matters here, right?
It's the idea of a government threatening to execute people for publicly voicing their opinions, fears and discontent over government policies that is abhorrent.
This is only compounded by the audacity of these murderers to try and blame Israel or any other country on the planet.
This is all on the Iranian leadership.
Burn that phony government down and make Iran less shitty!
