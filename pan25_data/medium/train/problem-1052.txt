>In response, the Obama administration in 2014 proposed improving safety regulations for trains carrying petroleum and other hazardous materials.
However, after industry pressure, the final measure ended up narrowly focused on the transport of crude oil and exempting trains carrying many other combustible materials, including the chemical involved in this weekendâ€™s disaster.
Beyond that, even before the rules were watered down it applied to trains carrying only a certain number of cars (20 in a row, 35 total) which would have likely made it not apply in this situation again.
If our attempt to regulate equipment used by the fishing industry is anything to go by, it would probably result in an awful lot of trains with 19 flammable cars in a row, 34 total as well.
