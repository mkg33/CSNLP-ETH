In addition to packing (concentrating a voting bloc into a single district to reduce their influence in other districts) and cracking (spreading a voting bloc among many districts to deny them a sufficiently large voting bloc in any one district), both of which focus primarily on the relationship of voters to district lines, there are also two other tactics not as frequently discussed which focus on the relationship of candidates to district lines.
One is hijacking, wherein two districts are redrawn in such a way as to force two incumbents to run against each other in one district, guaranteeing that one of them will be eliminated.
The other is kidnapping, wherein districts are redrawn such that the incumbent's home is now in another district, making reëlection more difficult now that the incumbent either faces a new voter base (if they run in their new district) or no longer resides in the district in which they are running (if they run in their old district).
Lol i forgot who (Summer Lee maybe) but a rep in a district near me in Pittsburgh was running in a district that was a block and half from her home, but so badly gerrymandered that it was still her community.
The incumbent not from the community, but from the district, got all the attacks they needed bc “she’s not even from this district”.
It’s crazy.
