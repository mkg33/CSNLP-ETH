Don't forget that you're referring to the leaders of those countries, and not necessarily the popular sentiment of their people.
It’s not really a big part of the world even.
Maybe 1-1.5 billion out of 8, so maybe 15% of the world.
Don’t forget, India and China alone are like half of the world and neither of them supports Ukraine.
Not really most of it though, more like half.
We live in the West and have Western view of everything, but countries that have actually placed sanctions on Russia is the Anglosphere+ the EU, Korea and Japan.
Still, a big part of the world, but not the whole world.
That close to the Russian Border and being in the Donbass?
Not a chance, if Bakhmut falls it will be in permanent Russian control for the foreseeable future.
Kherson city was liberated only because it was in a bad strategic position (Dnipro river was acting as an effective barrier between it and the rest of Russian controlled Kherson oblast).
Then again the Ukrainians could try to pull another Kharkiv offensive, though I don't know how effective this will be.
