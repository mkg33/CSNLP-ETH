Idk about Scotland, but in some places, parents not reaffirming their child's chosen gender identity can be considered a form of mental or emotional abuse, and can result in the children being removed from the home.
It's already happened near where I live with children as young as 8yrs old.
The logical conclusion of that, is that you are ultimately putting the entire decision into the hands of someone who is legally underage.
If the guardians don't consent to a medical transition, they can potentially be punished.
So for parents it's an ultimatum, not a choice.
To take it all the way to the extreme, what is the legal difference between a 16yr old minor, and an 8yr old minor?
Because it could be argued that since they're of the same legal status, not applying the same standards to 8yr olds would be a form of age discrimination.
The same way you can't pass a law that outright prohibits you from driving above a certain age, because you're still an adult of the same legal standing as any other adult.
Because 16yr old minors who identify as a different gender for a couple of months, and have no medical diagnosis at all, shouldn't be legally and medically changing their genders.
At the very least not without their guardian's consent or a physician's supportive diagnosis.
If you think it's that easy to have gender reassignment surgery or to get hormone treatments, you really need to take a step back and question where you get your information.
Here is a giant clue that something is likely amiss: How do you think you get long term prescriptions for any medication, for any medical condition, without a physician being involved?
