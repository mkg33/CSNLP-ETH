Shit like this should terrify us all.
Unlike the unhinged conspiracy theories right winger toss out every time a Democratic president is elected, Trump is straight-up telling us going to implement death squads if he makes it back to the White House.
In a Trump 2.0 administration, there won't be any flawed but at least semi-honorable subordinates like Mattis, Kelly, or some of the others to put the brakes on idiotic and illegal policies - it's going to a cabinet of pure extreme reactionary sycophants who will do their damnedest to implement his every whim.
Especially the violent whims.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
