Stop making everything about skincolor and race.
Race does not influence our caring of a people going through tragedy.
The Kargil War (just googled it) happened at the same time as the Chechnya War and you both got about the exact same level of support worldwide (meaning none) because that's how much people were briefed on the reality on the ground, forget about knowing the details of weapons production and sales.
That information is easily accessible for the past 10-15 years.
You can't go back decades in the past and ask for the exact same treatment of phenomena as today.
It is completely disregarding the information landscape, access and education.
Did you know of the Kargil War, where Pakistan invaded India unprovoked in an action roundly criticized by the international community?
Did you know Ukraine took advantage of the situation by selling the Pakistanis tanks?
The only reason our civilians didn't get bombed senseless that time was because our military was strong enough to ward off the surprise attacks.
