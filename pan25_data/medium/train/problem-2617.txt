No not really.
Azerbaijan is technically neutral and isn't part of any large mutual defense pact and a observe state in the non-aligned movement.
While Azerbaijan does have economic relationships with Russia and their military still uses Russian and older Soviet equipment they have made closer ties to the united states and have begun purchasing western military equipment.
Their is a cultural connection to some parts of Russia and the shared Soviet and Russian empire history but that is starting to fade after the invasion of Ukraine.
With some Azerbaijanis concerned that Russia is trying to send message to Azerbaijan along several other post Soviet states that to stray from Russia will lead to invasion and the slow killing of your local culture and identity.
Poles also show that Azerbaijanis rate Russian leadership at 52% approval with many Azerbaijanis being openly hostile to any Russian that has relationships with Armenians.
Russian Caucasophobia and the apparent inability to tell the difference between Chechens and Azerbaijanis has caused further distrust of Russia.
ITâ€™s interesting because India and china hate each other and china is Russias biggest ally.
So if war breaks out between India and china, Russia would have to choose a side.
