Why do you guys defend this guys health so much?
He’s been in office a month and a half and has had 2 separate hospital stays.
The guy clearly has (more than likely permanent) brain damage because he campaigned instead of doing physical therapy during the crucial time period after a stroke.
It’s sad that this guy has been pushed into this.
In no way saying people had to vote for Oz…but he shouldn’t have been the democratic nominee.
His post stroke progress was clearly lied about by his campaign and the media.
