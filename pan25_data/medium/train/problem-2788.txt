I got almost got stuck in Spain during the omicron outbreak.
Right when they released that QR app code.
Luckily the number of people signing up crashed the servers and I managed to get back to the US before lockdowns again.
These were super popular for a short time in Spain for expats.
As you needed a covid pass to get into clubs and restaurants and you needed to be resident to get the vaccine.
So no choice for some but to get covid so they can continue with their life and not be locked at home.
The only way was to get a covid recovery covid pass.
some just decided to stay home, but a small minority.
I remember some kid in the US went to a covid party and died.
His last words were “I wish I hadn’t done it” pretty much.
How pathetic, not to use your young brain for something beneficial to society….
Yeah, I think this is a bad idea.
Isn’t viral load (time exposed and proximity) a big factor in severity of symptoms?
I sure wouldn’t seek out an infected person and spend a long time making out or close talking.
Seeing my sister as tired as a mono patient 7 weeks after testing positive is sobering.
