So being dependent on Putin for electricity isn’t a good idea?
Who said that a few years ago?
Was it Trump?
Why would Trump say that and sanction Putin’s Nordstream 2 pipeline, which Biden took sanctions off after he took office?
Isn’t Trump a Putin supporter?
This just makes no sense at all.
Tell me again why Putin didn’t invade Ukraine under Trump but waited until 13 months After Biden was in office?
I’m.
Let's just hope that Isar 2 - one of the NPP's - isn't to damaged.
Because as it is right now, it is a damaged NPP, and needs to be shut down if the life extension goes through.
For Repairs.
Yeah, that's horseshit.
Not sure where you got those numbers from.
Wind alone is 24%, and solar is 10%, as is biomass.
The 3 NPP's make up about 1-3% of Germany's Energy needs, are old, inefficient & the produced Energy is very expensive - far more expensive than any other source of energy.
In fact, it is questionable whether or not the 3 NPP's were actually needed to be kept alive on life support to begin with - because that's what it really is.
3 NPP's way beyond their lifespan being kept alive for energy security, which they don't actually provide & couldn't provide if they wanted to.
