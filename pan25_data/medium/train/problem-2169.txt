Media hysteria forced a response by the White House, and it was shot down over the Atlantic as a show of force/capability.

The reality of the situation is much more boring.
As a skier following weather patterns there’s been anomalies in the jet stream over northern China and Japan, and a dissolving/splitting of the jet stream over North America.
This has caused an absolute dump of snow over Japan, but that’s neither here nor there.
That balloon was absolutely massive.
The black equipment hanging from the bottom is the size of 3 city buses.
Look at how much larger the balloon is than even those giant pieces.
The boring answer is that it probably truly is a meteorological balloon with instrumentation that veered off course.
If it were actually a threat it wouldn’t have been allowed to traverse the country, and the message sent is that if it were actually a perceived threat we have the capability to neutralize it, before it’s a problem.
It was shot down to quench hysteria.
You conflate the concept of it actually being a threat with the concept of it being a spy balloon.
There are plenty of reasons why China may have launched spy balloons (yes there are more) with little strategic value that our military have interpreted as exactly that.
Not a threat.
Hence the publicity and the wait until it was entirely clear of land to shoot it down.
