Well so far all we've managed to export to Rwanda is millions of GBP and precisely zero refugees.
As the house of commons needs a lenhy and costly refit my vote is the politicians relocate themselves there for a few years ago they stop spaffing millions up the wall on fantasy projects.
With the mind-blowing amount to waste it would be cheaper to house the refugees in Claridges and send their children to Eton.
The Congolese are clearly in the wrong for violating their airspace.
It's dumb that they are operating out of the Goma airport, it's just asking for trouble.
Rwanda has every right to shoot down the aircraft, but they don't have too.
When Turkey shot down the Russian jet in 2015 that was stupid, but they had every right too.
Chill the Fuck out???
This is the 3rd Time a Congolese military aircraft is violating the Rwandan airspace in 3months.
The first 2 were just issued warnings.
Knowing the current tensions between the 2 countries, what type of response would any other country have to such violations?
Take it to the AU or the UN.
Radio a few more warnings.
In 2014 Finland had 5 violations by Russia, and no shootdowns.
It's similar in Estonia and few other countries.
Somehow they can manage to talk it out.
Really?
Can you give me an example?
As far as I can see war is always ruinously expensive for all parties involved and tends to be for either non-financial reasons (land, control) or resource conflicts.
This incident very easily could have killed people, and killed a lot of people considering it was right over a population centre.
It's just reckless, they should chill out.
Deescalate a bit.
Shooting down aircraft for minor violations might be legally okay, but it's stupid.
