That's such a terrible view to take of people.
For one, moving is incredibly expensive if you're just moving in your city.
Moving to a new state just adds so much more stress on top of it.
Secondly, people have families, communities, roots in areas.
If you're relying on family to help with childcare, leaving that support network is disruptive to everyone involved.
Not to mention how difficult it is to uproot a child and have them change schools and make new friends and have to be the new kid.
And sometimes people actually like their communities and would rather work to improve them instead of abandoning the people in them to cruel policies.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
