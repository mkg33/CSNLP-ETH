Also an ex-christian, and I think that's a totally valid way of reading the text, but I don't think there's just 1 correct interpretation of scripture on any given topic.
But then again, I'm not a Christian anymore, so the only criteria I feel comfortable using is self-identification.
I don't think it's really my (or any non-christian's) place to determine if some is or isn't in the group.
It just kind of smacks of people saying "catholics aren't real Christians" or "Episcopalians aren't real christians" because of some interpretation differences.
It's part of the reason I left the faith in the first place.
Anyone/thing can be misinterpreted/lied about in order to give you “permission”, instead of owning it yourself.
Or can be simplified too much.
For example: If you quote someone famous, you are essentially appealing to authority.
You are correct that intellectually inadequate people that can’t create authoritative arguments lean on others, but everyone (except extreme egotistical people) does.
Also, leaning on authority isn’t unique to religion: “other” can be religion, a political leader, a parent, a book, a historical figure.
