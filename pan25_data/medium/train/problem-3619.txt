Had RSV in late August and just tested positive for COVID for the first time ever this morning…and…holy hell is RSV like 1,000 times worse.
Took like a solid month to recover fully.
I’m barely feeling any COVID symptoms at all, but that’s probably due to the vax and several boosters.
If they ever make an RSV vaccine I’m first in line.
I mean I’ve had COVID once—this is my first time.
I’d rank it less than a minor cold.
Even if COVID didn’t kill 1.9 million Americans in 3 years I’d still want to avoid the hassle of being sick that much.
Which is why I get the flu shot every year.
Either I don’t get the flu at all or it’s a minor thing that lasts a day.
Had Rona once.
Scratchy throat.
That was all.
Vaxxed.
Wife and father in law had Rona before the vax and they were crushed for 2 weeks a pop.
Not sure if it’s a blood type thing or what.
I just don’t get sick in general so I have some kick ass immune system or something else going for me.
I legit have never had the flu or any real sickness that lasts more than a day.
A bad hangover is the worst I’ve ever felt.
Having said that, RSV is no joke.
It doesn’t travel like the flu or Rona but you don’t want it.
The young and old are particularly at risk because it hits so much harder.
Like life threatening.
Just get vaxxed in regards to Rona.
I’m actually considering the flu vax for the first time since I’m in the field having to deal with it.
So many viruses hitting at once may even overwhelm me (patting myself on the back).
