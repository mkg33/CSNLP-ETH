I recall reading or hearing that most big bands demand and get 100% of the ticket price and the fees are needed to pay the venue (and Ticketmaster).
In some cases, the performers also demand a cut of the fees.
So, Ticketmaster is a convenient scapegoat for the performers to hide behind in relation to the cost of tickets.

That is also if there is not dynamic pricing.
You pick out a $98.99 seat and by the time you get to the actual checkout, it is $980.99 because if dynamic pricing and with fees it winds up being like $1200.
Maybe a bit of an extreme example but it is still the dumbest thing ever.
