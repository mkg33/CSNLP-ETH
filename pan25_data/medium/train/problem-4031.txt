The problem here is, that a lot of recent demonstrations have been very small minorities completely blocking day to day life for massive amounts of people by blocking highways, distribution centers, airfields, etc.
It's resulting in ambulances not being able to reach destinations, food not reaching supermarkets, pharmacies not being restocked or recently a plane with aid for Ukraine being blocked by people chaining themselves to it.
Right to demonstrate is very important, but there's a thin line being walked here that borders on "We're going to keep yelling and making everyone as miserable as we can until we get it OUR way".
In parts of the U.S. the courts have not prosecuted people for running over protesters that were blocking the road.
It works wonders for keeping people out of the way.
No actually I'm pro choice, but I also think people should choose to stay out of the way.
I don't know, my parents taught me not to play in the street.
Edit: I may or may not agree with what they are protesting about but they must do so in a lawful way.
