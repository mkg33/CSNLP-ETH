I think what we need to keep in mind is that MTG is only saying this because she thinks it will benefit her agenda at the moment.
Her party didn't do as well as expected in the last midterm and the 2024 election is still an unknown, so she's trying to keep her options open just in case things only get worse for the GOP in the future.
However, know that as soon as the Republicans feel like they have the upper hand, they will immediately backtrack on this "national divorce" nonsense and try to force the entire country to bend to their will.
When Greene talks about "national divorce" she only describes it in a way that will benefit conservatives to the detriment of liberals (i.e.
"People from blue states shouldn't be allowed to vote for 5 years").
MTG herself has proposed nationwide bans on Gender-Affirming care so do not expect her or her ilk to actually respect the will of people in blue states if they ever gain full control of all three branches again.
