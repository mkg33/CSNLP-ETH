This TTP or Pakistani Taliban.
Their entire reason for existing is to fight Pakistan...
This why they operate out of Afghanistan and Americans refused to take them on.
Confused redditors think Pakistani Taliban = Pakistan allied Taliban but instead they call them selves that because they want to take over Pakistan.
The Afghan Taliban or just Taliban is concerned with taking over Afghanistan.
That Taliban is the one Pakistan gets accused of supporting.
The real ironic part is that Afghan Taliban was mostly defeated by the US.
It was the TTP that US never took action against that provided bulk of the fighters in the Taliban's rapid takeover of Afghanistan during the withdrawal.
Oh boy, then you have no idea just how many factions these “Islamic” forces consist of.
ISS for example are fighting the Taliban, the Taliban in general is fighting local warlords and on and on it goes.
One of the officers killed is reportedly the deputy director of one ISI section.
There's no way the ISI will take this lying down.
Expect retribution in some form or the other soon.
Pakistan is not letting the people of KPK rule as they see fit according to Sharia.
This has led to a rebellion from the people’s side.
Pakistan should let the people rule themselves as they see fit.
