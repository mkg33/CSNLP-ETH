You don’t actually change the pronunciation, it’s just to closer transliterate the Arabic since the original word doesn’t exactly have a K sound.
I explained more in another reply to the top-level comment.
That's interesting, thanks for sharing.
I've not seen many from Western sources.
Even in my country (Bosnia), it's spelled with a K, albeit closer to the original (Kur'an).
Basically all languages not ordinarily written in the Latin alphabet have different ways you can choose to romanize them to make terms from them readable to speakers of English (and Spanish, French, German, etc.).
Often, an ostensibly “outdated” system of romanization will be replaced with a more “modern” one and terms will get new spellings, like how the name of Mao Zedong used to be written Mao Tse-tung.
Koran and Quran (also sometimes written Qur’an with an apostrophe in the middle) refer to the exact same thing, the main issue is just whether to use a K or a Q to represent the Arabic letter ق, which is a sound that doesn’t exist in English and is pronounced sort of like a K that’s farther back in the throat, the technical term being a “voiceless uvular stop”.
You can listen to it .
