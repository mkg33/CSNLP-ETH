No it’s not.
It’s pointing out that even within the democrat tribe there are picket crossers and non union supporting people.
Pointing out the shit in your own house is not a bad thing, it keeps them honest.
Instead of this “dems do no wrong and if you say so it’s helping republicans” which allows dems to do horrible things.
Literally no one above has said that though.
I've actually never in my life seen someone say anything to the effect of "the democrats are saintly."
Most people around here acknowledge the fact that the Democratic party made being responsive to its constituents part of the brand, and that that's different from being the best possible option for human governance.
I really don't understand why people like you jump in the minute enough people agree the current direction of Republicans sucks ass.
Is it kind of a Tourette's thing, or just a pedantic reflex?
One of our two shitty political parties is normalizing mass violence, bigotry, and economic feudalism, and folks like you feel the need to referee the discussion as if acknowledging those things is worshiping Joseph Biden as a god.
There are certainly plenty of situations where people fall into destructive groupthink, but this instance is not one of them.
