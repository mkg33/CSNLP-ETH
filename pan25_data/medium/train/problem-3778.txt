School is six months followed by roughly six months to get certified after you arrive at a unit.
So typically 12 months.
But those 12 months assume no familiarity with air defense, tons of time spent on general training/random stuff that can be cut, weekends and holidays, and lukewarm support on arriving at a unit.
Given the proper motivation and support, I think you can make a well trained reload crew in a month and a certified van crew in three.
Especially, if you have some people who already have experience on their own systems.
If we sent them a single radar array connected to just a single line battery that’s still at least 100 people.
6 launchers with 16 missiles each, they could effectively defend against a strike of 75 missiles which is about the size of the strikes they are being hit with now.
In the US, a Patriot battalion (600 people) consists of a headquarters battery, a maintenance company, between 4-6 line batteries, 6 launchers and 70 people per line battery, and 16 missiles per launcher.
That means a battalion could effectively launch over 300 defensive missiles at once across all batteries.
Poland has never requested deploying German personnel to Ukraine...
They insisted to supply battery which is happening after few weeks of histery created by German media.
I am tired of strightening these idiotic statements on every corner.
This has become ridicoulous.
How Poland which only supplies hardware could request other country to send their troops to Ukraine?
What twisted way of thinking it is?
Or it is only defence mechanism to create chaos and blur point of case?
14E’s (the brains behind the patriots) go through a lot of school.
The 14T’s not as much in school but training to setup and tear down in a proper maneuver element takes time.
^Germany will now "join the United States in supplying an additional Patriot air defense battery to Ukraine," the White House announced.^ which is exactly what Poland said.
