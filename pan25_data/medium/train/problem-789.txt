I guess that's what its like to grow up in a country where the information you receive is controlled and censored by a dictator government.
The Chinese people are actually quite intelligent and aware of their political situation.
They know exactly who and what Xi is.
They also know that even with the military, Xi cannot survive as premier if the populace turns against him.
When you cannot move a rock that must be moved, you crush it instead.
The rank and file of the Chinese military are not automatons, they will not tolerate the massacre of their Mothers, Fathers, Brothers and Sisters.
Governing China is a delicate balance for a fascist prick like Xi.
He can only pound on the populace just so much before the people become a massive tidal wave drowning every fascist prick who gets in the way.
With fascist and other authoritarian governments, there is always a tipping point of popular support vs. popular condemnation.
Has China reached that point yet?
I don't think so but, roll out the tanks and have another Tienanmen Square type incident and Xi could see a billion pissed-off Chinese citizens in the streets outside of Zhongnanhai, the Chinese Kremlin.
I suppose they get closer because he's also tanking their economy by refusing to admit that western vaccines work better.
It appears to me that Iran has reached the same level of popular angst and disgust with the religious leaders of the country as they reached in 1978 with the fascist Shah.
Iran is at an inflection point, for the good of the people of Iran and the world, the best thing that could happen would be for the people to throw the current government out on it's keister, dismantle the revolutionary guard, end the export of terror and establish a western style social democracy.
There will be carnage but, the people of Iran deserve better than to live their lives in the 14th century.
