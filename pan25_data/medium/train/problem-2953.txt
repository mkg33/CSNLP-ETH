They own lots of land and make money from rent, farms, and now windfarms.
All that money goes to the government, and the government gives the royal an annual sum.
This is a good deal for the government who get a profitable deal for eternity in exchange for paying all the royal's debts one time a few hundred years back.
The crown is going to make more money now by having wind farms on their land.
That goes to the government as usual, normally they'd get some back, the king has requested he does not.
It's also worth noting that the proportion of the fund's profits going to the royals recently increased in order to pay for the renovation of Buckingham Palace.
It's a huge property portfolio in addition to farmland.
In fact they're suing Twitter for being behind on the rent for their London HQ.
It's good for UK people too, because I don't trust politicians to sell off all these yearly profit making assets for cheap to their mates.
It's nice they're kept out of the politicians hands, but we still get the vast majority of the profits.
Here in Canada, we have "Crown Corporations", but they're not owned by the crown, they're owned by the government (federal or provincial).
These are corporations like the provincial healthcare/insurance system, electricity providers, transit service providers, etc.
