I don't really care what happens to my body after I pass away, but it does matter to me that my remains don't end up occupying physical space, being filled with strange liquids, using fuel, or being contained in a $5,000 box.
I find the concept of turning into soil and plant nutrients to be really lovely, and it fits in well with my spiritual and personal beliefs.
