At this point they might well be at the point where nobody reasonably -can- stop them.
Just don't by apple or amazon.
Vote with your wallet.
You read that wrong, the $173m fine was scrapped.
That's a $0 fine and some unspecified bribery and legal costs for their profit.
Nov 9 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) were accused in an antitrust lawsuit on Wednesday of conspiring to drive up iPhone and iPad prices by removing nearly all other resellers of new Apple products from Amazon's website.
The proposed class action in Seattle federal court objected to an agreement that took effect in January 2019, under which Apple gave Amazon discounts of up to 10% on its products, in exchange for Amazon letting just seven of 600 resellers stay on its platform.
This transformed Amazon into the dominant reseller of new iPhones and iPads on its website, according to the complaint, after it had previously carried a limited number of Apple products as well as knockoffs.
Prices rose more than 10%, while Apple stabilized the prices it charged in retail stores, the complaint said.
Discounts of 20% or more that were once common no longer are, it added.
The case is Floyd v Amazon.com Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Western District of Washinon, No.
