Yeah, but you do recall the part about taking over the means of production, right?
That requires force, and that needs to be enforced by, well, force, and thus a central figure, be it a dictator or politburo, naturally becomes in charge.
It's literally an emerging property of the system.
You can't take people's property without using force, and that itself always leads to emergence of, well, warlords.
Someone should remind North Korea that Japan and The US has a special mutual defense pact, and that an attack on one country is considered an attack on the other.
From the point of view of those living under it, the practical differences between fascism and communism are much less noticeable than their practical similarities.
They are both just versions of oppressive totalitarianism - the supposed theory underpinning why the tiny group in power have some innate inviolable right to dictate to others is just window dressing.
Its not the same as NATO or the EU Defense treaty, its total, unconditional and direct military support on all levels.
If Japan were to consider that as an attack then it would be the same as if North Korea attacked The US.
Something for North Korea to think about whenever they launch all these old ass 80s retro rinky-dink unreliable shite rockets in their "firing range".
