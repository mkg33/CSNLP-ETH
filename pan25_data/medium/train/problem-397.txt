The prime opportunity to ease the suffering that could have been avoided in the first place.
This is what us Ukrainians were shouting about in the first months of the invasion: military aid and support, swiftly and without reservation, will help to avoid massive humanitarian catastrophes that will spill over into EU borders.
We already have several cities with up to half a million dwellers razed to the ground, without water and electricity, uncountable numbers of villages destroyed, and tens of thousands civilians dead.
However many diapers, wet wipes and warm socks you send, it’s treating the symptom, not the cause, and the symptoms will only go worse as time goes by if the aggression is not stopped.
As I sit in my apartment in Kyiv for up to 8 hours without electricity, I don’t need a warm coat.
I’ve been spending the last month chopping wood, gathering supplies, adding insulation to my home for this winter all of us here knew was coming.
I need anti missile and anti-drone systems to catch the rockets & drones that target our energy sources so that we can have heating and power.
However many shipments of humanitarian aid you send - they’re not going to change the picture and number of saved lives with those supplies are nothing compared to what could be saved with a properly supported defensive military response.
On my local news there were reports of considerstion on evacuation of whole Kyiv if heat, water and power problem is not resloved for winter and we are taking about 3 mil people.
Such a sad scene it will be if it comes to it, I have no idea how will they pull off that.
