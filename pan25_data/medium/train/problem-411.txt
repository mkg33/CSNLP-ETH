The article you linked is from a very unreliable source.
For several days, Newsweek were publishing articles about these 'leaked documents' yet somehow no credible news agency did.
Sure, but much like Crimea/Donbass before they invaded; Russia took part in destabilising Moldova hence Transnistria.
It's all in the same playbook of reinstating the USSR "Glory".
If Russia's invasion of Ukraine would have gone according to plan, Moldova would have certainly been next.
Russians have installed a self-proclaimed autonomous government in Transnistria, so it is a self-proclaimed sovereign state of its own that is recognized by Kremlin.
There's a sort of border control Moldavians have to pass through to get to visit their relatives in Transnistria and the other way around.
Journalists and people with cameras are not allowed to pass from Moldova.
The Transnistrian government employed a large number of people in the military, so it's kind of martial state there.
Since 2014, Russia's efforts in Transnistria and Moldova have intensified and are focused on destabilizing the area- they cannot allow Moldova to have 0 internal conflicts to prevent it from dreaming of NATO.
Luckily, Moldova somehow managed to elect a pro-EU president, but her life is not easy at all.
