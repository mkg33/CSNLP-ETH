Couldn't have put it better, that is a spot on summation.
And it's always been this way.
Remember reading an account of Russian troops advancing west to Berlin during WW2 being gobsmacked when coming across quite humble German peasant houses which had butter and cream inside...which they had never encountered previously.
But I assume they have a handful of actually operational nukes.
So that adds some… spice.
Other than the nukes yes they’re going to quickly be in a similar boat.
China will buy their oil, and buy North Korea’s coal.
That works.
This is a little bit of a dangerous mindset.
The people are not the government, that's true in the USA and especially Russia.
The impact of sanctions leading to extreme poverty is an indirect strike, affecting the most vulnerable and those least in control of making decisions.
People forget that the vast majority of the Russian population were bound, feudal medieval-like serfs until 1861, and that most people were illiterate even at the time of the civil war in the 1920s.
