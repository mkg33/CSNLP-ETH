The world will not end with a war of bombs and gunfire, it will be a slow painful death of poverty and pollution.
The rich will and are running every government and the plan is growth.
Never ending growth.
The rich will live in great green wonderlands and the workers will slowly whither away.
Then they will try to revolt but the war machines of the rich will easily terminate the people.
But that loss will end the rich, no one to grow the food, no one to make the products they bloat their profits on.
They will die to in their own filth.
The earth will flourish after we end and I can be ok with that.
The 1972 book Limits to Growth is an interesting study.
It's basically a model of how long the economy can continue growing, and how this is related to population.
So far it has been quite accurate in its predictions, as corroborated by a KPMG (a big auditing company) environmental division review a few years ago.
The report predicted that economic growth would flatline and then tank by 2040 or so due to recourse depletion, and that there would be no bounce-back on that occasion.
The report also predicted a massive population collapse in the 21st century due to resource depletion and pollution if business continues as usual, which it has.
Sure, they won't be selling shampoo, but the guy who owns the former state of Oregon will need to buy weapons (either physical or cyber weapons) to defend his territory.
Or more spaceships to supply his space stations on Mars.
Or a space yacht the size of Manhattan.
Or improvements for his personal Oregon safari.
Etc.
corporations?
the recycle guy at the center in Snellville, GA told me to buy a bag of kittie litter and pour the used anti-freeze in the bag and throw it in the trash...
