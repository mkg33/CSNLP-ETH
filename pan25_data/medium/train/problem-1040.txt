I had to get my retired father a new ID after he let his driver's license lapse for over two years and let me tell you, the process is not at all easy.
We had to schedule an appointment and we got lucky to find a slot open the following week on the other side of town.
The other appointments were 4-6 weeks out.
We then had to collect all his documents and drive across town, wait in the office another hour and present his docs to the clerk.
And I am a well educated man and my dad has good finances, so navigating the system and being able to drive across town for half a day was within our means.
Also, the only reason he was pressed to get it is because he needed to get on a plane.
There is a good chance we would have put it off since it is such a hassle and he doesn't really need an ID at this point in his life.
This is how voter suppression works.
Voting is at is very core an irrational act.
The chance that your one vote will be the difference in an election is at the level of lottery winning.
Far more people die in accidents driving to the polls than there are people who's one vote makes a difference.
Make it difficult so 5% don't vote and you can swing an election.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
