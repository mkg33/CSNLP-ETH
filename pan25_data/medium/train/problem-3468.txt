I had a great uncle who fought in ww2 and was fighting in Germany at the time when the war was ending.
Combat was really largely over in his region cause the Russians were pushing from the east and most German troops were neutralized.
Well he's alone in his tent one night and a German officer walks into the tent pointing a gun at him.
Unfortunately my uncle's gun was across the tent and he didn't have a chance to grab it.
Fortunately for him the German officer says to him "I am your prisoner".
He was doing this because he know capture by Americans was preferable to death or capture by the Russians.
My great uncle kept the Germans luger and to this day my dad's cousin still has it and will shoot and clean it periodically.
reminds me of when my grandma was deteriorating in health.
i went to visit her and figured i would cheer her up by pulling out old photos from her hallway closet.
well…i found a .22 rifle i bring it to her and asked her what this was for.
a smile came on her face and she said it was my grandfather’s (who passed 20 years prior) and she knew where the bullets were.
she wheeled herself to her rolltop desk and pulled out an envelope full of bullets.
i had no idea.
