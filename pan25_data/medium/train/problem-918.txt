The fact that something like PCOS or endometriosis wouldn’t have qualified as a chronic condition for medical leave before is ridiculous.
Regular debilitating period pain is not the norm, it’s a medical issue no different than Crohn’s disease, diabetes, or sciatica.
This isn’t giving women special rights, it’s about not excluding their uterus from normal medical leave.
Paid leave for painful periods should absolutely be the norm in the US.
It’s fucked up that so many women live with this condition and society is relatively callous and not understanding towards it.
But shouldn't paid time off for medical reasons be something everyone should get?
In Ontario, Canada there are zero paid sick days for anyone required by law.
Although many employers do give paid sick days because they value their employees, many businesses, especially the low paying ones do not provide any paid sick days.
It shouldn't matter if its painful periods that happen every month or getting sick with things like covid, influenza, notorious, or any other thing that would mean that someone has to take some time off because of medical reasons.
