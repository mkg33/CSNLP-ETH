I'm a Canadian citizen who has been trying to get people's attention on stuff like this for years.
CSIS, the Canadian agency responsible for counter-espionage, has been trying to raise the alarm for at least 10 years about cases like this, but so many politicians are already bought and paid for that it's been an uphill battle.
At least 2-3 of these types of cases also come up in Canada every year as well.
The Chinese are very active in these sorts of attacks/spying games.
Chinese people are great, but the CCP is not a friend to Canada.
I frankly worry less about the RCMP, and more about how compromised our politicians are.
It isn't just us, this is happening to many countries - the Australians come to mind as another often targeted country.
Maybe first case with that specific electricity producer.
Like Mikash33 mentioned, CSIS has been publicly warning about this for a long time and it's not the sort of thing they would make public unless they were 100% sure and had many examples because of the politics involved.
