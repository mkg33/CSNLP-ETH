It’s the right thing to do.
It’s heart-breaking on behalf of the athletes, but so is genocide.
They should feel the consequences of that as Well as any russian.
"Yes we know the Nazis took this from millions of innocent people whilst ruining their lives, but it's in our country now, and we're neutral so... get fucked.
".
Line should be drawn when you invade a country with bombs, thats fair line.
Do what a hell you want in your country but when you inavde no olimpics for u ?
Isnt hard to draw that line.
That's whataboutism if I've ever seen it.
We live in the present.
Russia should not be in any international sports.
International sports represent unity across the world and sovereignty of each participating country, for good or ill. Russia has violated that sovereignty, thus violating the very principle that international sports exists upon.
So fuck em, and stay out till you respect other peoples sovereign rights.
The whole point of boycotts and embargos is to affect those who have nothing to do with the war and force them to choose between what they want and their neutrality.
I care less about the world being unfair to unfortunate athletes than raped Ukrainians.
