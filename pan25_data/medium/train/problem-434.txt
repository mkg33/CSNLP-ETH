Mao Zedong had a way with words - he was a fan of potatoes, especially sweet potatoes.
I guess China might be spared a lot of the trial and error that normally goes along with such ventures.
I'm guessing too they'll manage pretty well as they have all the info they need.
Space though is very tricky and there will be failures and setbacks.
From article: While still in its infancy compared with NASA's technologies and experience, China's space program has come far since the mid-20th century, when the country's late leader Mao Zedong lamented that China could not even launch a potato into orbit.
sweet potatoes are really popular in china because they are the only crop that can be grown in between rice paddies.
Before tubers were introduced to china all the space between rice paddies was wasted because they could not get anything to grow there.
After they figured out potatoes grow in that space every farmer started planting them and they because very cheap and plentiful because as you can imagine china grows a lot of rice and has a lot of rice paddies.
