It's important when hurling generalizations to keep in mind there's a separation between the voters and the ruling class.
Voters are often earnest even when being led by their noses.
As for the elected, I saved this comment from another thread, because it's the clean and concise truth of it: "Always remember: their only values are their own personal enrichment and power.
The meandering path they use to get there will change, the explanations will change.
It won't make sense.
It will be self-contradictory.
That is because strategy can change and tactics follow strategy, but what doesn't change are values.
The strategies they employ are solely to achieve outcomes matching their values.
".
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
