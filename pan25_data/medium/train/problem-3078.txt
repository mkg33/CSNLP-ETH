And--further, and this isn't necessarily for you but others--please be extremely suspicious and push back on people insisting on empty accusations framing the DoJ or Garland as weak, cowardly, shy, fearful, not doing his job, not doing enough, dragging his heels, etc... and downplaying what just happened with Rhodes and his people.
At best, those sorts of comments show someone is wholly ignorant of how due process works and the precedent of other cases (they are simply legally talking nonsense they must have heard from someone else); and, too likely and worse, they are actively trying to undermine confidence in the justice system.

There is every reason to believe, based on the evidence publicly available about the DoJ's movements, that they're going after whom the evidence leads at the pace that due process dictates--by and large.
