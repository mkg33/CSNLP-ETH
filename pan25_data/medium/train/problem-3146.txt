GOP means "Grand Old Party".
The Republican Party is neither that "Grand", nor that "Old".
It was "cobbled together", from what was left of The Whig Party, The "Freesoilers", and other opposition parties; in the 1850's.
The Democrats are a little older, basically the "Jacksonian Democrats", and dating from the break-up, of The Democratic Republican Party; during the 1820's.
The Opposition, The Federalists; essentially "self-destructed", after John Adams' Administration, and the contentious 1817 Hartford Convention; and Opposition to The Jacksonian Democrats eventually coalesced into The Whig Party.
