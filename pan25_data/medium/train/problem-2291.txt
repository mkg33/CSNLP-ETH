$60 seems too high.
Especially compared to the $30 they considered.
Seems like the russians have friends everywhere in politics.
The new measures also include an EU embargo on Russian seaborne crude.
Only Hungary and a select few others are allowed import via pipelines.
The countries importing the biggest amounts via pipeline are Germany and Poland, with both countries closing those pipelines.
There are still many countries outside of the G7 and Europe that require Russian oil and won't be able to buy more expensive oil.
Currently, benchmark Brent crude is trading at about $86.
If the price cap was set at 30 like Poland suggested, Russia would probably stop exporting oil driving up prices even further and leave many countries without oil.
The idea behind the oil cap is also to either force Russia to sell oil at a minimal profit or have them waste ressources on building their own shipping and insurance evosystem.
Edit: I want it to be clear that I'm not saying is should be $30 but it should be lower than $60.
It seems like some people are confused and think I said above it should be $30 a barrel.
Russia started the economic world war in the summer of 2021 when they slashed natural gas flows to the EU such that natgas prices shot up very high.
They did that to economically weaken Europe and make them very resistant to helping Ukraine.
Thank goodness it failed.
