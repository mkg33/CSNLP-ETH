Pharmaceutical companies could be made to disclose prices and deals agreed for any products they make to fight future pandemics, under rules being drawn up by the World Health Organization and reviewed by Reuters.
A draft version of the WHO's pandemic accord, which it hopes will be adopted by its 194 member countries, calls for it to be compulsory for companies to reveal the terms of any public procurement contracts.
The WHO says public funding for the development of vaccines and treatments should be more transparent, and include provisions to ensure that any resulting products are distributed evenly around the world.
I still feel disgusted by how corrupt the European Union was on the secret deal with Pfizer and how they tried to cover it up!
Edit: Sorry but if you and allow it to spread globally, you caused it.
No matter how much and they blame.
Glad to see some media outlets are actually skipping the middle man and posting directly on this sub.
Love it.
Good for your clicks, good for this community.
Smart.
