If you want it to become mainstream, then you need an easy way to get in.
Until you can come up with a cex-less method of doing that that the average Joe knows to be reliable, cex will always have its place.
Looked it up, if you think that’s comprehensible enough and reliable enough for the average Joe then you don’t understand what it takes to get to the average Joe, plain and simple.
That’s Not going to gain any mainstream traction.
People shouldn't trade equities if they don't know what they're doing.
Any kind of asset.
The point is Kromatika is a decentralized exchange aggregator for web wallets.
You don't own your crypto on a CEX - they hold it for you.
Look at FTX.
As long as you have the keys to your own wallet then you're already a head of the game.
I'm open to your rebuttal.
My rebuttal comes down to the fact that crypto was, as the name and the push to make it spendable like cash suggests, intended to be currency.
Make it difficult to understand and use as such and you’ve lost the point.
