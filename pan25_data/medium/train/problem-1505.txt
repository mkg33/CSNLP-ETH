The threat, in other words, is not specific to Israelis.
The anger driving the treat is against the Turkish government.
The international teams are targeted because that would gain maximum publicity.
Basic summary: if this account is accurate, locals are furious about the Turkish government response.
In particular, the Turkish government apparently plans to quickly bury victims in mass graves, something the locals see as an insulting attempt to sweep the disaster under the carpet.
Some locals, allegedly, planned to put pressure on the Turkish government to stop their plan, by kidnapping international rescue teams, because this would gain international attention.
For this reason, several international teams (not just Israelis) are pulling out.
That's because you are sitting comfortably using logic.
These people just went and are still going through an absolute tragedy.
People change when that happens, especially when they can't trust the authorities they're supposed to be able to rely on.
