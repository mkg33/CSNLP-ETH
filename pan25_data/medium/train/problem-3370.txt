"I like to flip it around.
By this logic don’t higher personal income tax rates just get passed on to businesses as increased costs of labor?
If I paid a higher tax rate I’d demand higher pay, but that’s not how it works, my pay is determined by the market based on location, credentials, experience, etc.

Prices are limited by what the market will pay, with considerations for cost of inputs and overhead.
Income taxes are calculated after-the-fact based on net profits and have no bearing on how prices are determined.
Also just a reminder that the corporate income tax rate was nearly double what it is now back in the 50s and 60s.
I could see this happening in the long term, especially if the workers have a high level of bargaining power (e.g.
in a union or a profession with barriers to entry).
The only reason it seems like this doesn't happen today is that worker's rights have been seriously eroded in most parts of the U.S.
