Gonna be interesting to see how they thread the needle of "we supported the act to not be crazy in spite of the support from our cray cray people".
The Respect for Marriage Act seems well on its way already, so that should make it.
The Electoral Count Act absolutely needs to get done, especially with Mango Mussolini running again.
That avenue for post election shenanigans needs to be closed off permanently.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
The respect for marriage act is as important to republicans as it is for democrats.
In 2024 there are still going to be a lot of crazy right wingers in the electoral pipeline and the Republican presidential candidate will need to moderate after running to the right in the primary.
That candidate will need to say “Hey, don’t worry about the crazy social conservatives in my party, we passed the respect for marriage act on a bipartisan basis so there is your proof that we are not as nuts as the MSM wants you to believe” and that will work in just enough counties in the 5 swing states to possibly elect a Republican president.
The Republican religious crazies are supporting this Bill because they hope that it can be used to support their crazy beliefs e.g.
polygamy.
