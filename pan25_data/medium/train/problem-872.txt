It hasn't been talked about much, but corruption cost Ukraine control of the city of Kherson.
The governor stonewalled the deployment of defensive plans, and the city fell with almost no resistance to Russia as a result.
Russia funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into bribing Ukrainian officials; too bad for them that most of the bribes were either ineffective,or siphoned off by Russian corruption.
They fully expected no resistance based on the level of bribing and corruption going on among Ukrainian government officials.
Hell, even one of the lead negotiators from Ukraine at the start of the war was bought and paid for by Russia, and was feeding them information while "negotiating" a ceasefire.
Ukraine has done an incredible job rooting out corruption in the last year, but they still have a long way to go.
To corrupt officials, disruption caused by Russian invasion is good time for them to siphon off aid sent from west.
I am sure many more will be caught and sacked as investigation progress.
Getting rid of as much parasite as possible is good for the health of nation.
