Probably true, but there’s a huge difference between trying to squeeze a couple of extra bucks out of consumers and arresting and executing people.
China is wasting their AI resources to oppress their own people with social scores and the US has been using AI for its intended purposes.
China is not on par with the US in AI.
China is just more heavy-handed and oppressive with their roll-out.
That's literally his point...
US private industry is driving AI (and by extension tracking) for profit, and is more advanced in many respects than China.
The strategies towards application of this amount of information are indeed different.
That doesn't mean the US has no comparable systems to what the Chinese government has over their citizens.
The reason folks might think China is ahead is due to the size and intrusiveness of their state surveillance apparatus.
Surveillance in the US simply isn't comparable because it doesn't have a visible impact on day to day life.
However, in China, there are widespread consequences for minor infractions.
As if to say the US has no programs like the Chinese government has in terms of collating data on every citizen for the purposes of... Whatever purpose.
I mean, is it paranoid to think we have such programs, or is it naïve to assume we don't?
Basically anything else we have the capability of doing, we have the ability to do, above and beyond what other countries are capable of.
Local government is not representative of the US federal government, which is an insanely complicated beast, and in my opinion, you just vastly underestimate it.
