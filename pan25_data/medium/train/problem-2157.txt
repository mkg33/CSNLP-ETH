They can do that through Saudis who already are against official Iranian government, or maybe through Kurds in the north via Kurds in from bordering countries, no need to leave direct traces that lead to western intelligence services, it’s not like Iran doesn’t have more than enough enemies in near proximity.
Would be better to read "government buildings of iran light up, and burn to the ground in support of protesting".
Because at least that would have an effect, instead of thoughts and prayers.
I don’t understand why the comments are so negative.
Every successful social movement has chatter and encouragement and it’s not only helpful, it’s necessary to keep the movement alive, to keep hope alive even.
Maybe a better option would be to use western intelligence capabilities to sneak a few thousand automatic rifles through the border into Iran so that protesters would have something to push back government forces, instead of stating the obvious by lighting up a useless tower on another continent?
