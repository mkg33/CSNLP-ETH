But I wouldn't include casinos here.
They're more an example of a stable system.
In roulette, there are a fixed number of slots on the wheel (37 or 38, depending on whether there's only zero, or also double-zero), and all bets pay out fixed rates (eg, two to one, three to one, 36 to one, etc).
There's no volatility there.
In the long run, the house will always win, because the payouts don't match the true odds for any given bet.
Betting red or black pays two to one, but the odds of, say, red, isn't one in two, it's 18 in 37 (or 38), which is close, but is paying out slightly less than it should to be fair.
Same with craps, blackjack, slot machines, etc.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
