Competitive pay means competitive applicants.
If you want good teachers, you gotta make it an attractive job.
Department for Education data suggested that 44.7% of state schools in England were open but restricting attendance, while 9.3% were closed.Only 17.4% of secondary schools reported being fully open during the teacher strikes, compared with 52.1% of primary schools.
Teaching should be a field whose pay is high enough that it does get talented college kids actually considering it as a legitimate, lucrative, career path.
If the pay is shit, the only people doing the job are people who aren't good enough at other things.
This is ridiculous.
The teachers are taking action because they're not being paid what they deserve.
It's sad that they have to resort to striking in order to get the recognition they deserve.
Let's hope that the government finally listens and gives them the pay raise they've been asking for!
Frankly, saying that we should pay them shit because they aren't doing a good job is a feedback loop of idiocy perpetrated by the idiots who would suggest such a thing.
