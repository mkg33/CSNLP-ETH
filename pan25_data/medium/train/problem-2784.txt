My oldest uncle broke out the box set of AC/DC live in concert after my grandpa's funeral visitation.
DVDs were the thing back then, and the funeral home had a fancy new entertainment setup.
The thing is, my grandpa HATED AC/DC.
So it was just me and my family after a long day, hanging out with my grandpa's corpse just chillin' in the next room, with the sweet guitar licks of Angus Young blaring over the speaker system.
My uncle was a hellraiser growing up, and he and my grandpa always butted heads.
So I'd like to think it was his way of giving one last "salute" if you will.
Hidetoshi Imura (Heart Surgeon 1) is very active on Facebook and a genuinely sweet guy.
When my daughters graduated high school he congratulated them on my feed and leaves little comments.
He had a bad heart attack a few years and the Office fan community swarmed him with love.
Hide is my favorite character on that show, hands down.
