Yeah...Kanye is crazy.
Yes he is promoting a lot of racist ideas, but the dude seriously is incapable of caring for himself.
Everyone will see soon don't think even money can insulate oneself from the kind of problems Kanye has.
I haven't followed the kyrie stuff much.
To me it has seemed the whole time that he understands.
He is playing into it.
I've never been more upset at a black man for being so racist.
He is actively making himself look like the clown the gop thinks the average black man is.
I get that he isn't bright, but he seems to be dancing like a...dancer for them.
He even does it in a way that was seen in the past when these 80 year old men were in their prime.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
