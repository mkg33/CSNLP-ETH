Man, the problem with social media misinformation seems to be widespread across South East Asia.
In Vietnam, people straight up get their news from Facebook.
In addition with the fact that people there have no concept of verifying accountable source and do not trust official new outlets.
Misinformation can pretty much spread like wildfire.
In Vietnam, luckily it’s still only limited to scams or some showbiz shits.
But we all know what happened in Myanmar.
Facebook was detrimental in creating the conditions that enabled the Rohingyas atrocities.
Now, it’s the Philippine with its election.
I really wonder why social medias have such a destructive effects on the region.
Internet education should really be a thing, especially in developing region like SEA.
Facebook disinformation campaigns and troll farms really did work their magic here.
