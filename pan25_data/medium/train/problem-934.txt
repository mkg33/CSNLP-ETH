This bill was never going to get past the senate.
The dems could freely vote yes without fear of upsetting their wonderful lobbyists from big pharma, big tobacco, and big booze because it had 0 chance of passing (and for some reason 2 dems still opposed weed so strongly that they refused to take the easy pr win).
Senate dems Jeanne Shaheen, maggie Hassan and Jon Tester haves tated directly that they will not vote for decriminalization or recreational legalization.
Joe Manchin, Bob Casey, and mark Kelley have also recently told politico they were undecided.
Manchin has in the past seemed pretty opposed to recreational though.
