I don't think anyone now thinks the war has made Russia better off in any sense.
Thanks mostly to the great courage and resolve of the Ukrainians, it is severely weakened and will continue to grow weaker the longer the thing continues.

Under any deal with any chance of happening, Russia will end up looking like giant loser and its invasion a massive mistake in the eyes of the rest of the world.
