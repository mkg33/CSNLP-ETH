I heard Tim Miller from The Bulwark talk about her on a podcast.
They travelled in the same circles before Trump and he considered her a friend.
He said he would love to be able to say that he had no idea how she went off the deep end, but sadly her cynicism is as transparent as her see-through ambition.
She is the very best example of shamelessness.
She had a history of being smart and thoughtful before she shut it all off in her quest to ride Trump’s coat tails.
