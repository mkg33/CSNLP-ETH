Peru is really in a difficult situation.
Conceding to the extremist minority, who are basically attempting a coup against the democratically elected legislature, would be unacceptable.
On the other hand, many of the protests are violent, doing things like blockading cities, so deaths are almost unavoidable if the government stands its ground, especially given the prevalence of police and military brutality.
Meanwhile, moving up the election date, which might appease some of the less extreme protestors, is proving difficult to do.
President Boluarte supports it, but doing so requires a supermajority in the legislature, and many legislators don't want to cut their own terms short, especially since Peru bans the consecutive reelection of legislators.
Nah same shit with the racist right-wing Bolivian gov that took over after evo.. actually killed protesters just like this new peruano right wing.
It's gonna be fujis people in charge now and gonna get worse.
Then all the middle-upper class Latinos on reddit will turn a blind eye.
