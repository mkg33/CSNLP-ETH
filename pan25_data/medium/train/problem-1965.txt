"involved in mobilization" is being frontsided here.
It's true but it doesn't seem like his involvement was anything major.

Are these guys who keep dying Russiaâ€™s best and brightest military minds?
Or are they actually able to replace all of the losses they have between mysterious deaths and war deaths with ok leaders?
