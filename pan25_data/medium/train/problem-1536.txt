To you maybe, but the larger nuclear powers think differently.
The US and Russian Militaries wouldn't be completely wiped out even in a full scale war and they plan on fighting for the ruins left over.
Russia has a modern nuclear arsenal, as verified by 150+ on-site indistinct by US experts of sites, warheads, and delivery systems over the last ten years or so - half of those inspections were unannounced.
The US also has full access to all Russian telemetry data, in addition to other monitoring mechanisms.
The US doesn't inspect their entire military, and even the most corrupt Russian oligarchs know that a working nuclear arsenal is the only security they have for them to keep running their little kleptocracy.
The US has forces and bases covering the entire planet, even if the US and Europe were glassed, all the US carriers would need to be hit, all the US island bases too, the African bases, the Middle eastern bases, all US allies ( including Australia & Japan too), etc.
Russia has contingency plans hiding equipment and material in the middle of nowhere Siberia, not that they could really do anything substantial, but both governments still plan past the "End of the world".
It'd be easier to build a modern nuclear arsenal than it would be to deceive 160 inspections teams with the access they had across the entire country.
