US Congress says no new fighters or modernization kits for Turkey until Sweden and Finland's NATO bid is approved.
Erdogan needs a win desperately that's why he is fucking around with this NATO issue to show he is strong.
There is no immidiate danger to Finland and Sweden so he will push the issue until the elections.
Turkey, for good or bad, holds a very strategic position in NATO.
Hungary... does not.
Orban can posture all he wants for his nationalists, but if it comes to push and shove, he can be very effectively influenced.
Im not informed enough to discuss politics in Hungary.
However from i heard from news he is close to Russia but also an EU member and requires funding from EU and Poland will cut their own arm if it can be thrown to Russia.
They will not cooperate with Hungary if they cooperate with Russia.
They need Poland more then they need Russia so Orban is less of a problem then Erdogan.
Romania and Bulgaria also fulfilled the criteria that we have agreed upon together as Europe Union, for 12 years by now…bad luck…long live dictatorship in Europe be fk Austria!
