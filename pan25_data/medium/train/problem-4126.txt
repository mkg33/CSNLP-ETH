Did I ever tell you about the time I went horseback riding with George Santos, but there weren’t any horses around?
Well, Santos throws a saddle on my back and rides me around Wyoming for three days.
Well, wouldn’t you know it, my stamina increases with each day and I develop tremendous leg muscles.
So anyway, Santos decides to enter me in the Breeders’ Cup, right, under the name Turkish Delight.
And I’m running in second place, and I’m running and I break my ankle!
They’re about to shoot me.
Then someone from the crowd yells out, God bless him, ‘Don’t shoot him, he’s a human.
'.
