.. Putin Pants has little to worry about with his economy if China keeps back alley trade going at that rate ..
I guess in Poohbear's defense we aren't seeing Chinese machine guns missiles and drones in Ukraine yet.
If they take what they need from Russia (where previously they were getting it from somewhere-else(tm), then the supply from somewhere-else has less contention for it in there service of meeting the demand of the rest of the world.
Its restructuring the global energy market.
China and India have access to extremely cheap oil and natural gas right now as Russia is redirecting a lot of its supply to Asia.
The western world at least the parts of it keeping to their agreements (some countries tend to play fast and loose with the rules or find loopholes) does not.
Western countries will be paying whatever the global market rate is and buying more from OPEC sources.
Given how much of the global manufacturing occurs there its probably not even possible.
At least not without grinding most of the western world to a halt.
There are entire product ranges that you can only source from factories in China right now.
There is one district in China produces most of the worlds optics for example.
We are already dealing with massive supply chain problems.
Just cutting the cord like that would amplify that exponentially and be utterly crippling.
