CNN is peculiar in seeing "democracy on a roll" when American voters just handed half of Congress to a party that less than 2 years ago attempted a violent coup to end the semblance of democracy that exists in the country.
Still, it was the best mid-term performance for the party in power since 1934.
Apart from a few odd years, usually the party in power loses seats.
All the past economic trends would have implied a big Republican wave.
But that didn't happen, surprisingly.
The reason for the fascists to underperform in the 2022 election was not because of their coup attempt in 2021.
It was because fascists on SCOTUS took away half the population's right to control their own bodies.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
The price of gasoline changed the minds of more voters than the coup.
That fact reveals just how weak the support for democracy is in America.
