There also probably aren't that many women working in NGOs in Afghanistan today.
Obviously some of them stayed after the Taliban took over but if you're a foreigner working in Afghanistan (especially a woman) you already know that you are risking your life.
Most NGO workers are passionate about what they do but not downright suicidal.
How do the Taliban benefit from turning Afghanistan into a failed state?
They aren't doing well right now and their solution seems to be to make things much worse.
Mainly their plan for foreign power is just simping to China.
Domestically just be a dictatorship that uses bribes, force and diplomacy to get tribal leaders on their side.
There still is basically Northern Aliance 2.0 around but no idea if anyone is funding them.
Last big project with China was a copper mine and it went to shit when the Chinese got assaulted and went back to China.
The Taliban are barely a regional power and can't project it worth a damn.
Doubt Putin has enough energy to deal with them so far China is interested in their Opium and rare earth minerals and that's basically it.
