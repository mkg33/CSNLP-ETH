In mean, sadly yes.
The support by the West is also dependant on popular support.
When the negative consequences of this war get to big in the countries that are now supplying Ukrain the support might go down.
But it's not ok to close the pipeline that belongs to the enemy and funds them directly, because "contract".
That ally was president of Motor Sich, aircraft manufacturing company.
They supplied engines for russian military helicopters through shady schemes, even after the invasion started in February.
Boguslayev is also pro-russian himself and he was waiting for the "russian world" to come.
Now he's in jail and Motor Sich has been seized by the government to work for Ministry of Defense.
The pipeline supplies their 'allies' or realistically we should call them in this case 'friendly states'.
"I give some money for people who rob you so they can buy new guns, but we still friends, ok?
Also, could you devliver those money for me pls?
".
Especially funny since one of the first things that were powered back by our government were pipeline.
So citizens can stay in the dark, but oil must flow.
Priorities...
