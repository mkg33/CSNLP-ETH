My family is from the area near the front lines so I've been looking at the news daily since the start.
Initially casualties started at 300 a day and went up to 1000 a day with peaks of 1200.
When they routed the Russians at Izyum the eye witness reports confirm insane casualties which the Ukrainians had to clean up as that was now their territory.
Given how huge the front line is it's a very conservative number.
You gotta remember they were the same army 30 years ago.
The senior leadership has a very good idea of the numbers of the enemy.
The Russians don't report mercenaries killed or soldiers conscripted from the Donbas area where as the Ukrainians do.
I wonder if the injured category only counts soldiers who were taken out of action permanently.
As in soldiers who had to return back home either permanently or for a time.
It's a lot more than that.
Ukraine estimates 120,000 killed on the Russia side.
If you include wounded we're talking 3x that number.
They already burned through 500,000 men on the Russian side.
The cold and mud has also created a ton of none combat casualties.
That's why the Russians are calling up another 1.5 million men.
Unfortunately for them their equipment situation is bleak so they are gonna be sent into a meat grinder while the Ukrainian side is well equipped just lacking in ammunition.
Ukraine has so many volunteers that they are turning people away.
