Personally I was banned because they were crying about the Emmy’s not wearing masks.
All I said was “they were all tested negative right before” my comment was deleted and I was permanently banned.
I didn’t say anything negative or talk shit or anything or snidely say “I thought you didn’t like masks?”.
I just politely and directly told the truth.
When they banned me I replied “free speech” (that’s all i said) and the r/conservative mods reported me to Reddit for “harassment” and Reddit send me an official warning.
