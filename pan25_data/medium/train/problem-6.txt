I'm sorry.
But the guy definitely offed himself.
He was going to prison for selling children as sex toys - the dude had riduculous wealth and he lost it all.
The plea deal was absurdly controversial.
If you think the guards gave two rat fucks if they found him dying, then I genuinely feel sorry for you.
At MOST, the guards saw him doing it and just let him and then pretended the cameras broke.
There is no conspracy.
Would have been great if he served life in prison, but instead his final actions allowed for all charges to be dismissed, resulting in no one getting any justice.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
