Well they have a deal with Pakistan to supply about 8 nukes to them immediately the second the house of Al saud wants, it was part of the deal when they funded Pakistan’s nuclear program.
It would be sort of like US bases on nato allies soil like Germany and turkey hosting nukes, and thus guaranteeing the saudis nuke protection.
One reason why they won’t make it themselves is that the house of al saud needs the Saudi military to be weak to stop any general from rebelling or coups so that’s what they will likely go ahead with and they have the resources to fund a Pakistani base on their soil.
In fact they hire Pakistani soldiers as mercenaries for protection and stuff.
Israel knows better than to attack Iran by itself.
My concern is Israel and Saudi Arabia teaming up to find a way to make the United States fight Iran for them.
Republicans already did that by turning it into a religious issue.
Democrats have been trying to slowly sever ties because OBVIOUSLY this shit was going to happen.
Anyone with a brain could see Israel would drag us into one quagmire or another, sooner or later.
All these assholes have to do is start meowing "BuT mUh JeSuS iN tEh JeRuSaLeM" and the conservative war machine will ramp up just as it did after 9/11.
Then we can go _there_ and die until the 2040s.
