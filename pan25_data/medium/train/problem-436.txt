Trump signed an agreement with the literal Taliban giving them back Afghanistan, setting the date for the hand off early in Biden's term to make him look bad.
Trump released hundreds of Taliban soldiers for absolutely nothing in return, ensuring they'd be in the strongest possible position before this scheduled hand off.
Trump is basically the reason the Taliban got Afghanistan handed back to them.
They didn't just take Afghanistan over because we left a power vacuum, they were literally GIVEN the country back by Trump with like, signed promises and shit.
I mean the level of enforcement is becoming quite clear and while many of us would agree we think more should be done, the world has killed 110k Russians as a joint effort to not escalate into an actual world war.
Enforcing this rule would enmesh the US is so many conflicts that the American public would never tolerate it.
The warning is meant for only a handful of countries.
Just like who knew the Taliban would be just as bad after the US pulled out of Afghanistan as before.
Just a lot of reddit had been calling for the US to leave for years.
