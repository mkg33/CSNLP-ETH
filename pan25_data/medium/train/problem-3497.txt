The terminal speeds of the weapons are also often not hypersonic.
Aegis air-defense has also come a long way and even IRBM RVs like the DF-21 can be countered with the SM-6 in the terminal phase with reasonable capability.
What stuff like hypersonic glide vehicles are a way to extend payload range or to miniaturize booster rockets for the same range/payload over ballistic missiles.
Hypersonic cruise missiles are a bit more unique but have terminal velocities comparable to ancient weapons like the AS-4 Kitchen.
They simply decrease delivery time.
Plasma stealth is not a thing except for low-frequency early warning radars because 1.
High frequency radars including and above the Echo and Foxtrot bands (S band in IEEE), which are most fire-control radars are still reflected unless you have really really high plasma density.
2.
Plasma is fucking hot to the point where orbital IR sensors are likely to pick it up.
It's like someone told them that Putin loved the Transformers movie and somehow their Naval division took it to heart.
The only thing outclassing their ship builders is their missile builders.
(The rate of missile failure in Ukraine is as high as 60%,... that's six out of every 10 missiles fired in some places completely failing.)
You couldn't do a better job of sabotaging your own military than Russian industry.
It's like they're all CIA plants.
