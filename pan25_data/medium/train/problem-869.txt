what is up with torture/pain fetishists on reddit?
I mean, i'm no fan of putin either, but if the guy needs to be killed, then kill him.
Neutralize the threat with either lethal or non lethal force, where appropriate, and get on with our lives so we can focus on rebuilding.
It's not about torture.
It's about putin fearing that he'll end up like dictators like Ghadaffi, Mussolini, Ceau»ôescu, etc.
The comment about bayonet is a direct reference to Ghadaffi.
Allegedly, putin watched the video of his death many times and was terrified.
Hence why we should use the assets from Russians ever $ spend of Russian money is $ we need to spend ourselves.
Double gain take money Way from Russia and support Ukraine at the same time.
I don't disagree and support this.
But I wonder if some in the West want to keep the frozen assets as a bargaining piece?
Oligarchs would (theoretically) be more likely to push for Putin to end the war or for his removal, if they know (or think) they can recover their lost assets.
