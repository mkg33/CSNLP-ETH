How about giving credit to the candidates who put forward positive, truth-based political policies which appealed to a majority of US voters, whose votes for some legislative races were squelched through gerrymandering, and yet still managed to prevail in a very difficult economic, political and media environment?
How about the idea that political media has been hijacked to make a small, fringe minority sound like they own the country?
How about the narrative that human beings want good, progressive government and do not want to live in a billionaire's fantasy land?
