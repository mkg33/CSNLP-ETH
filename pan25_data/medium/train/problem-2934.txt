Fuck the IR.
They keep targeting Iranian minorities like the Kurds, the Baloch, and the Bahai.
They've hated these people from their beginnings and are using the current movement as an excuse to target and kill more of them.
Please, anyone reading this, help us Iranians.
Post about what is happening.
Use hashtags like stopexecutionsiniran , iranrevolution , and womenlifefreedom.
Spread the message as far and as often as you can.
I know it seems silly to think social media hashtags make a difference, but they actually save lives and help the movement.
It helps the message get out there.
And it really helps the Iranians in Iran keep going and keep their spirits up.
I'm Iranian in the diaspora if anyone has any questions or wants to know more about how they can help!
Nope, they let go 10000 or however many isis people they were supposedly holding prisoner.
Enjoyed their big check and crates full of guns from the daddy US.
Kurds will not get any respect from Turkey, Syria, Russia or Iran until this happens.
Plus their own military to back it up.
