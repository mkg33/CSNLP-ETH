An actual blockade would imply China stopping and potentially seizing neutral shipping, including American shipping.
The right of American merchants to go anywhere and sell anything around the world has always been policy and casus belli for the Americans.
During WWI, America's eventual declaration of war on Germany was directly caused by German Unrestricted Submarine Warfare which killed Americans and impacted American sale of both war contraband and regular goods across the Atlantic.
Moreover, at the beginning of the Cold War, the American-led Berlin Air Lift was a strong response to Soviet attempts at blockading West Berlin, as well as a potent demonstration of Allied logistics capability.
So the case of a blockade on Taiwan, the United States would have all the moral and historical justification to call China's bluff by sending supplies to Taiwan, forcing China into an uncomfortable position, where they must take the loss, or fire on American ships and risk bringing America into the war.
China could blockade Taiwan to restrict certain imports/exports and hold Taiwan's economy hostage.
If America doesn't intervene, Taiwan's government will have to either surrender or watch its economy crumble.
