Yeah, I know where you’re going.
It’s just Cletus having beef with Josiah and taking his birdshot to school to settle a score, or a rival gang member earning his chops in the bloods, is a little different than someone going to a school with an arsenal with the express intention of killing as many people as they can.
This is where we excel.
I’m sure other countries have had similar statistics of shootings at schools proportional to the size of the country.
But nothing like we have now since ‘99.
And many countries such as Australia, who had that whole “voluntary gun giver upper drive”, banned guns for these reasons.
But you’re right of course, there’s a long history.
In general, be courteous to others.
