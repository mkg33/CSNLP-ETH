- Due to the grassroots effort, got Shervin Hajipour's song "Baraye" nominated and WON the first ever grammy for song for social change, spreading the message even further.
These comments of "nothing will happen" do nothing to help the Iranian people.
They only hurt us and our movement.
You might think you are giving us a reality check but believe me, none of us needs one.
We know exactly what we are up against.
If thereâ€™s one thing we Iranians have an unlimited supply of, it's tenacity and stubbornness.
As long as those in Iran are still fighting, those of us outside of Iran will continue to be their voice.
If you want to help, it's as simple as sharing social media posts.
The message coming out of Iran has been unchanged for almost 5 months - keep posting, keep sharing, keep our fight alive.
I know it sounds ridiculous to think social media can actually help those who are dying, but it is because of posts that this movement has stayed alive, that has given the people on the ground courage to keep going.
People in prison continue to reiterate that we need to keep their stories alive, to share them.
If you want to take it further and you live in the United States, call your Congressional Representatives and tell them you want them to support the MAHSA Act.
its just hard to convince some people that the west can play a role in bringing democracy to the middle east.
we hear stories like this and our butts pucker up at the thought of another regime change effort that takes a bad situation and makes it infinitely worse.
