The Democratic Party has a Senator who is, by all observations, experiencing a severe cognitive decline who would actually run a chance of losing even in California if she has to debate or give a speech publicly.

This man is going to live in the worlds of the Senate races in Michigan, West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, Arizona, Nevada, and maybe Pennsylvania for the next three years.
And if he's feeling like he has some extra time, he can dig into Indiana, Texas, Florida, and Missouri.
