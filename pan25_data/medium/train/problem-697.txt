Giving the name of the facility doesn't help anyone at all since I'm assuming she was one of several people giving out vaccines there.
That means that almost all of those 8000 either remained unvaccinated unless they decided to go back just in case, and thousands more people had to question whether or not they actually got the vaccine the first time and many probably went back and got one too many doses.
Also she most likely killed at least one of those 8000 people, probably more even outside that group since it says that it was mainly hospital staff that she was vaccinating which means the virus got to spread around more easily among the sick and elderly.
Ridiculous that you can cause such a clusterfuck and face such little punishment.
They should investigate every single person she "vaccinated" and charge her for every single covid death of any of them.
That's disappointing, considering what a blow to people's trust in the healthcare system she might've dealt.
This extreme betrayal of the public's trust in someone aught to have significant consequences.
as a physician- I rely on the vaccination for peace of mind.
I dont have to freak out everytime I see a sick or old person (which is every fucking day).
It isnt perfect but it is the best the modern world has to offer.
This excrement of a human being put countless people in danger.
Out of sheer stupidity and piss poor education.
Statistically I cannot imagine she is not responsible for at leats a single unneeded infection which potentially killed someone (an old person for example).
This is so beyong scummy- it is straight up unimaginable.
