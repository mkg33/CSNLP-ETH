Knowing my country arms history - we will probably come up with some sort of upgraded South Korean tank in future, like we did with PT91 Twardy or like we did it with assault rifle Beryl, where we took old soviet concept and made it different/better/up to NATO standards.
The buying spree comes as Poland attempts to solidify a position as a leading pillar of European relations with the United States, with the war in Ukraine shifting the balance of political power in Europe further to the east.
That was hammered home this week as Biden — who has yet to visit Paris or Berlin during his term —  since the war began.
Makes perfect sense, actually, that Poland should adopt that mantle… none of the same baggage as the larger powers, and a huge moral remit.
“Germany — a traditional bulwark of the transatlantic relationship — has shied away from a military leadership role.
And Poland, which is losing out on $37 billion in European Union cash because of its democratic backsliding, can claim moral high ground when it comes to security and its long-standing skepticism toward Moscow.”.
