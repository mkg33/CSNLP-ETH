Funny sci-fi fact, it was actually after the realization that men like Musk were using AI to enslave the race that humanity turned away from all computers capable of thinking.
Yeah, but they turned from AI to people so exposed to that crazy "dust" shit that they really weren't even human anymore.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Compared to that, building an AI to do the crazy math for interstellar travel wouldn't be a big deal.
So happy you posted this, I was scared to detail too much since I'm still reading the books(only know bits and pieces of theml.
I found the Mentats of the dune universe fascinating due to the drug induced super-intelligence they possessed lol.
Never really thought about the fact that they pretty much traded supercomputers for the exact same thing with flesh like you said.
It's just always seemed like the greatest scam ever.
A bunch of drug addicts has the whole galaxy in the palm of their hands, devoting insane amounts of resources to getting them the drug.
Yeah, it's not like I'm a huge Dune fan or anything.
I don't even know if anyone in the books realizes it eventually.
As an experiment I kept selecting show fewer tweets than Musk, but his tweets kept showing up.
This normally works for other accounts, but for his it didn't - I eventually just blocked him.
