I agree with you but this is not true, some states require people who can't make it in person to apply for mail in every consecutive year and if you don't you can't vote.
She isn't even a moderate republican, just for the record.
But I would imagine she has some influence, although that group hardly exist anymore, its now a much narrower field of swing voters or apathetic voters.
