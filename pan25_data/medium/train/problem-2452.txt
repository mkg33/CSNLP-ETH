A bunch of Russians digging trenches in the exclusion zone because they didn't learn about Chernobyl in school and probably missed the HBO miniseries, then they all had to go to Belarus for treatment a few weeks later.
OK.... take a breath..... russia gives zero shits about anything "Geneva Convention" related.
It is obvious to all that russia threw that book in the trash can when they invaded a sovereign country.
Could we stop the blatant shitposting here?
Nobody's using biological and chemical weapons, most notably nowhere near on the same scale as what got them banned in the first place.
There are a whole host of other rules that are followed almost, if not all of the time, that we really just take for granted.
Are you low-key accusing EU of not giving a fuck about Geneva convention?
Because I have news for you.
EU is a world power, a peaceful one right now, but you wouldn't want to mess with them if you aren't USA.
And we give a fuck about human rights, ecology etc.
Perhaps more than anyone right now.
Like I said, peaceful now.
Those small countries hold a surprising amount of soft power and technological know how.
But if you were ever to cross them directly...
They would be nothing like Russia's paper tiger.
Quite the opposite, actually.
