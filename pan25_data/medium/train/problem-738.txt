This speaks to a fundamental misunderstanding of Chinese governance.
The ones with true power, like Jiang, don't need to hold office.
Jiang stacked the party with loyalists so he could be certain he would be able to continue influencing politics despite being formally retired.
Xi needs a third term because he lacks a clique he can continue to influence upon retirement.
Despite no longer being general secretary, Jiang still remained in charge of the military during the first year of Hu Jintao's term.
Many agree Hu was unable to fully realize his goals because of Jiang's interference.
A WikiLeaks transcript showed Hillary Clinton informing her private audience that China's foreign policy was ultimately controlled by their military establishment, not Hu.
If you criticize Xi for underhandedly cementing power by enshrining Xi Jinping Thought into the constitution, you should also criticize Jiang for doing the same when he enshrined his "Three Represents" ideology into the constitution.
As far as I know, US government only goes after individuals from the Jan 6 group that actually attacked the capitol, not anyone and everyone associated.
