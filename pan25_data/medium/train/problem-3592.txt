It's not an acknowledgement that what Santos is doing is in the wrong, and it's a roundabout way to justify using logically unjustifiable tactics.
This idiot is saying that Santos lied and won over 'stupid woke America'.
Santos is merely the latest in a long line of Republican liars that includes Donald J Trump, the worst liar in the history of the Presidency.
The fact Santos won after telling an obscene amount of lies doesn't condemn stupid woke America.
It condemns Repblican voters, who have yet again been taken in by a conman.

Is this a joke?
The entire article is a whatabout argument ostensibly justifying the election and term of a complete con man and serial liar.
