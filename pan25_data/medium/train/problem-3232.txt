Hungary is even worse, Russia at least has most it's imperial lands and wasn't a consistent loser since 1850.
Hungary is a shadow not only of it's former self, it is a relic.
a small leftover of a once massive kingdom and political hegemony.
it is a country that isn't increasingly irrelevant, it has been irrelevant since the revolts in 54. it made a big deal out of migrants and refugees since that was the first time in decades that they felt important.
it hates the EU since it reminds them just how small and weak they are, hence why they are flirting with great powers a continent away since it gives them warm feelings.
Hungary wasn't really a massive kingdom since the middle ages.
If we are talking later than that they weren't either.
Hungary was always the Austro-hungarian equivalent to what Belarus or Ukraine was in the USSR.
If the UK, Austria, Germany, France, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Italy can get over losing their former glory, so can Hungary.
Atleast they have regained their independence, lol...
bud, i am describing it from the point of view of their national myth.
they seriously think that of themselves thanks to Patriotic EducatioTM and a generous understanding of the lands they were granted by other powers.
in actual history they are the biggest losers in Europe, believing themselves a great power despite the mere reason that their Uralic language has survived is that they made allies quite quickly.
under that view of history not only is their current condition not humiliating like they view it, it is the best position they have been in since Genghis Khan, being able to get jobs abroad, visit family that was left outside Hungary due to WWI and being able to enjoy political freedoms.
and it would mean that corruption and election engineering would be problems both obvious and in need of addressing.
