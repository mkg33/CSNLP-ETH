I agree.
Personally, I think Xi’s government is having difficulty dealing with the situation.
On one hand, it wants to unite with Russia to challenge the US-led world order (since Xi has been in charge at 2013); but on the other hand, if China publicly stands with Russia, then it has no position arguing Taiwan belongs to China.
Here is where Zelensky can show the world whether China is serious about its peace plan.
If Xi say yes, China is serious.
If Xi say no or give excuse he cannot see Zelensky then the plan was just for publicity.
That’s why it calls for “peace talk”, to prevent further dilemma.
However, Xi has filled his “cabinet” full of his men, and I am not sure if they have the wisdom to handle this.
As a Chinese, I hate to see China getting more isolated as it has been the biggest beneficiary from the global trades.
Being isolated means people suffer as Economic bubble bursts, and China is depending more on Russia, which also means it’s more likely to offend Taiwan to transfer domestic contradictions through war.
Sadly, dictators care more about their own interests than their countries.
