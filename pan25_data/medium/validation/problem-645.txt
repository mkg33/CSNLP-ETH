Well that's the answer right there.
Nobody would have ever though any golfer would willingly leave the PGA just a few years ago, but money has a way of changing things.
The problem is that, as the PGA-LIV debacle illustrates, you'd likely just be hopping out of the frying pan into the other frying pan.
Youd likely need it at a national level and you risk (at least in Europe) destroying the ecosystem of the leagues.
Im sure premier league clubs would be happy to start they're own federation where they can't be relegated so long as they can play European football.
The fans would not be happy about that though and expulsion from FA/UEFA was what prevented the European super league and orginal premise of the Premier league a few years/30 years ago...
Now if UEFA and the FAs below it decided to leave fifa and start a new org called FUFifa then it might work but I'm sure fifa can give some of the bribe money to them to keep them on board.
Unfortunately at this pou t fifa is basically to big to fail and there isn't really much you can do at the player or club level.
Apparently there's a player's union?
Maybe they should actually do union-type stuff and organize a walk out with the other teams... right now, when it matters, while the world is watching...
