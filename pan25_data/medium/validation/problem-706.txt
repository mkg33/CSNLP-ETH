It might have made sense to vote for him when there was a chance that he would give the Senate to the Republicans, but this is no longer the case.
As of now, it only makes sense to elect him if you want to weaken the party by adding an incompetent member to it, one who is a terrible person too.
Sure, he will just vote as instructed, he won't be making decisions for the state so he cannot do excessive damage to it.
But this means senators outside of Georgia will be making decisions for Georgia.
The alternative is someone who can actually think for Georgia and who is in the ruling party so he can have more influence on what benefits the state.
Democrats will be in charge anyway, so may as well have a relevant Georgia voice in the Senate instead of no voice at all.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
