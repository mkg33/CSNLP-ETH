Same, except with India, and instead of ww2, its partition(when Pakistan was formed.)
Basically the options were flee, refuse to convert and be killed, or convert and have your wife and daughters taken to be given to other men.
I haven't been to Croatia yet, but my Grandad was born there before being forced to flee after WW2.
So this year I'm trying to go for citizenship there.
My grandfather wasnâ€™t born here though.
Fam is from Catania.
We go back and visit a few times a year and I canâ€™t understand a lick of what theyâ€™re saying.

What happens to bank accounts?
Presumably you just wake up today, log-in and see: old_number_you_expected_to_see divided by 7.5345 instead of old_number_you_expected_to_see?
You could probably get away with it if the gap between any entry and exit stamp is within the time as no-one will be bothered to check if the sum-total was within the allowed time.
You won't be able to get away with that when the whole eSchengen thing comes into action as it'll all be tracked centrally.
But that's one of these boondoggle projects that keeps getting pushed-back further into the future, so may never see the light of day.
