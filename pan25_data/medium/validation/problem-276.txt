I was doing some math on the voting population in Texas the other day and got super depressed: 29M people in Texas, 18M registered voters (don't know if I am buying that 11M people are too young to vote, but whatever), only 8M voted in the recent midterms.
So that means that just over 4M people are making all of the governance decisions for 29M people.
This is the problem.
If the registered voters would ALL vote, most of our political problems would go away.
