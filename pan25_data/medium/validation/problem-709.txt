You're way more likely to find actually good people in weapons production than this field.
It's stinks worse than Nurgle's ball sack.
Option 2.
Stop pumping oil.
Oops, it's winter and the oil wells will freeze/congeal.
That's incredibly expensive to fix, and maybe impossible given the equipment sanctions.
Would you be worried about them phase separating out and making bubbles in the equipment?
E.g.
if there's a low pressure high spot in the pipe, they could bubble out around a valve and cause it to freeze.
I work in oil and gas in the Alaskan Arctic.
Everything can be freeze protected.
When you want to close a well in the winter time, you inject something down hole that won’t freeze; such as methanol, a mixture of water and methanol, or “dead” crude.
I've never heard of flaring oil.
Flaring typically refers to burning off methane gas, when it's too big a headache to actually process it.
I suppose they could burn crude but I'm not sure how easily that can be managed and contained, without making the local towns or oil wells uninhabitable.
