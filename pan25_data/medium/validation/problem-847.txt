Closer Indian ties has been the American policy for the last decade.
Especially during Obama period significant co-operation started.
Trump cutback on Indian visas but in terms of defence there was significant co-operation.
Biden government's abrupt withdrawal in Afghanistan have increased Indian fears of terror groups again growing in the region.
Then America provided military aid to Pakistan for their F-16 and American diplomats made a visit to so territories claimed by India, this was seen as payback for India buying Russian oil but both are serious redlines as far as india is concerned so this has made the relationship definitely strained.
Biden's foreign policy needs to be reviewed it's binary and agressive but that has alienated India and a few neutral countries in the bipolar world of American block and Chinese Block.
India would never support China but it can pull back it's co-operation with US, which will not be in the best interest of US considering their biggest threat is China for the foreseeable future.
Russia are probably luring India into a fking trap anyways especially allied with China and Pakistan!
Russia will shaft anyone's arse...never trust the fkers.
