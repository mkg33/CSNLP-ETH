I think there is a deal between putin and erdogan and this is one of the topics they agreed on.
this can explain all the trade going on between them.
ps: as a Turk, i can say you have no idea how dangerous erdogan is.
He can turn in to putin ally in a blink of an eye if it serves his interest.
Basicly he is Lukashenko.
lukashenko can chose too between either nato or russia but if he chooses nato he will be sacked in no time either by fsb or the people of belarus for different reasons tho but still.
erdogan will choose only himself.
that makes him more dangerous and ununpredictable for Nato, Russia and Turkey.
Those who choose to cut off their own feet just so someone else suffers are more problematic to deal with.
If push comes to shove, Erdogan will be offered big enough carrots, and he will take them before fading happily into obscurity.
Only carrot he wants is getting re-elected and dont loose power.
He is doing everything he can to do that in Turkey.
We are living under pure dictatorship.
When NATO was founded, they couldn't predict how demand of consensus turn out to be later.
Same goes with the EU: it wasn't predicted that two countries would hold an alliance to vetoing all the sanctions against each other.
Both of the organizations should aim towards agreement by majority, but it's going to need -- you guessed it -- consensus from all of the members.
