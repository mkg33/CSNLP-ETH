The Republican constituency has almost no expectations from the people that represent them other than be republicans and oppose the democrats.
These awful people rise to the top of the party because being terrible to people that are different happens to satisfy their constituency’s expectations.
DeSantis is terrorizing school children and trafficking humans around the country while Trump is trying to one up him by promising to execute more prisoners.
The worse they are, the more popular they become with their base.
Polls have been showing that, in a race between DeSantis and Trump, DeSantis would come out ahead.
Those same polls also showed that, with Nikki Haley in the race, she would draw enough from DeSantis that the race would shift back to Trump.
She’s not taking away Trump voters.
She’s actually helping him by running.
Which she’s hoping will be rewarded with a VP position, presumably.
