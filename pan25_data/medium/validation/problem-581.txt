I am the “boss”.
I’m one of the people that will fire you in a heartbeat, without much thought.
My job is to make the company money, the employees job is to make the company money.
It’s not to feed people, or give them coffee, or sell them a car.
The company is there to make money.
Period.
If an employee doesn’t make a company money, they get fired.
It’s pretty simple.
Good employees do make a company money- that’s why they are employed.
But what you think being treated fairly might not be what the company thinks is fair.
You are clearly a shitty boss, if the first thing that goes through your head is that you can fire people in a heartbeat.
You realize that employees can make a company money, while also being treated fairly, yeah?
Those things are not mutually exclusive.
And that makes a shitty company.
See how this works?
The needle always lands on someone being needlessly shitty to someone else.
I am a leader at company that pays me wayyyy more than I deserve and it’s amazing how I found leading through empathy and good will gets my employees to produce more, than leading through fear.
Maybe it’s different in the construction game, but that doesn’t mean it should be.
I’m a project manager for a construction company, I have superintendants and hourly workers under me.
I have the CEO and COO above me.
OUR JOB is to make the company money.
Before that, I owned a restaurant.
Before that, district manager at Waffle House.
I’ve been firing entitled employees for about 30 years.
