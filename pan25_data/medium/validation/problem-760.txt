He was in precisely this guy's position, though.
Just had it dropped on him, leaving him wondering if he was next.
Thing with Vader promotions is that they don't hinge on competency, just results or the lack thereof.
Either he will be fragged or he will be given a free hand in the operations to improve the coordination.
My bet is on the first one.
Hm, he's one of the best commanders in the Russian army.
But he was a chief of staff, so this information would mean that he was demoted.
When this next mobilization fails, all hell is going to break loose in the chain of command.
Their retreat a regroup gave them some cohesive directives and has seen the Russian strategy have some success.. mainly to do with the rules of engagement and stipulations we are implementing on the weapons we give the Ukrainians: you can only defend.
That means Russia can do artillery drone and air strikes from a distance.. but publicly and privately they are pissed and embarrassed by the last year.
Putin has more to worry about that than anything else.
This next wave will fail also, and then it’s a power grab at the Kremlin.
After Putins gone they will try to save face again with a huge push and maybe even a tactical nuke to make a point.
He probably thinks "When Oleg and Ivan invited me to Italy last February, I should have visited ... and stayed.
Now, how much Vodka is left in my quarters?
".
My feeling is… again this is my opinion… Russia gets away with using one nuke.
It will be on nato and the rest of the world NOT to retaliate and so restraint and the kremlin can easily blame it on Ukraine.
Two is out of the question, it will be WW3 if they do… but I just don’t see them getting out of this without making such a show.
Remember world: we have power, which seems to be the one thing the Russians are most upset about: pride.
Yes But not nuclear force.
It won’t retaliate with nuclear force.
certainly there will be a declaration of war but the policy will be towards non nuclear options.
MAD has long been the policy between our nations, it’s well acknowledged that nuclear annihilation is not an option for any nation and Putin has done well over two decades operating under those pretenses.
He wants to rebuild the Soviet Union not destroy it.
His not so thinly disguised nuclear rhetoric saber rattling is just that.. a constant reminder to the west that he two has that destructive power.. and it’s simply because he cornered himself that he’s reminding the world of it.
It’s not Putin we have to fear with that, is the Russians.
The military, the generals, his inner circle, his outer circle.. Russia isn’t a nation.
It’s a bunch of cronies with a gas tap and nukes.
They are pissed and embarrassed with what has happened and when the next offensive fails, all hell is going to break loose.
Putin will either be assassinated or will die “naturally.” And then one of these power hungry thugs will have the nuke codes.
Personally I believe that the is a large constituency of Russians that want to save face with this entire ordeal and that is why I do not rule out the use of one nuclear device being used somewhere.
To me it’s on the table and that’s why it’s been used as a bargaining chip.
Really… why didn’t it?
Diplomatic economic dependence on the Russian state?
Or large international interests in a continuous engagement where they just sell arms constantly to all sides..
I mean fuck how much money has US arms manufacturers made from this deal??
Subsidized manufacturers.. war contracts..
