Good point.
I talked with my wife about this on our ride home from early voting yesterday.
We thought we would beat some of the rush if we did it over a late lunch.
Nope 1 1/2 hours.
The log jam is the ID check, it went no faster than the general election.

I have little doubt that this day and age, when almost all have cell phones in our pockets, that we could come up with a way to have a secure, anonymous online way of voting.
Some will probably poke holes in that idea, it's ok I didn't think too much about it.
If it could be done as an option, we all know the right would block it from happening because they wouldn't win another election in many parts of the country.
