They might be able to hobble along for years, but if they are defeated in Ukraine, collapse will accelerate very quickly.
Did that account for them consistently making the worst possible decisions, like this one?
Most people make predictions assuming the parties involved are rational actors with good information being given to the people in control, and over the last year Russia has proven again and again that it’s anything but.
It still won’t end fast enough to have any real effect on the war even if that wasn’t taken into consideration.
The chance of a total melt down anyways is kind of low if North Korea can make it anyone can make it.
Brother Russia has china AND India along with a dozen other countries.
That’s over 1/3 the population of the planet, they’ll manage to stay afloat if only as a shadow of what they were.
India recently made a deal to manufacture weapons for them china gave a huge loan to finance their war in Ukraine a few months back so it’s not just superficial support.
Plus let’s be real nobody wants their neighbor with thousands of nukes to collapse nobody.
Then there’s all the far right refugees from Russia the EU probably wants to avoid.
Nobody wants to see total collapse unless they’re crazy.
Edit: bonus points for they’re still getting western parts by the fact they found the parts in bombs made as a recently as November from the us.
They have had access to those markets for decades and done nothing with them.
Now they are hemorrhaging money and neither China nor India either wants or can afford to hope on board the Good Ship Putin.
Of course they do it’s free money exploiting their resources once they fall.
They would be crazy not to jump on board especially since they just did.
You know giving them brand new weaponry as recently as two days ago.
