Yeah let’s ban something that 2 percent of the country used in 2020.
I’m sure they’ll just stop using it entirely and it won’t fuel the black market further.
Nah.
I think it's more about being able to ask people to stop doing it in public.
I had my first "old-timer whine" moment when I asked a guy to stop huffing that shit right outside the entrance of a school.
But legally speaking he's committing no crime.
Nor do I want the police to chase these people nor weedsmokers etc., they aught to spend their time on more useful things.
But I do think there needs to be a rehaul of drug-politics in most of the western world.
Especially up here in the Nordics.
From what I understand, I am not a Dane and could be wrong, there aren't laws against being under the influence of drugs in Denmark.
I'm sure being an unruly goon would break other laws though.
I visited Denmark recently and was in awe of how open alcohol sales are there.
You can get beer and hard liquor seemingly everywhere and open containers are not heavily enforced (maybe legal?)
Yet no one seemed drunk or unruly.
Nope, not unless you're shitfaced or causing a ruckus but even then we're pretty lenient.
Tons of our traditions are about getting drunk as fuck in public, parks etc.
That doesn't mean it's okay for you to sit outside a school drinking straight from a bottle of alcohol, that'd be a dick move and not accepted.
And how many of that percentage were involved in driving while using it anyway?
There's no appreciable number of people who are out there with like actual large tanks of it that they sit there breathing, and even less that would for some reason be doing that in the driver's seat of a car.
I just can't see someone that enjoys doing it having any motivation to do it while driving outside of a handful of weird rare outliers that are statistically insignificant.
