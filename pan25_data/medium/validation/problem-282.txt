For those unfamiliar, the "Architect of the Capitol" (AOC) is a job something like the superintendent of the US Capitol Complex, which includes the Capitol, all the Congressional office buildings, the Library of Congress, the Supreme Court, and a few other random government buildings in the neighborhood.
So the Architect is in charge of security, maintenance, daily building operations, etc.
Over 2,000 people work for the Office of the AOC.

The title is a relic of the early days of the United States, when most of the founding fathers were Freemasons.
