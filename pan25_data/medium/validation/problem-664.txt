Why do we need this to “work”?
Hold adults accountable.
If Biden was careless he should be held accountable.
Trump should be too.
If Biden is charged first then it can set a precedent.
His nonchalant expression of keeping these in his garage makes you wonder what else he is being super casual about that he shouldn’t be.
It’s a security risk no matter who it is.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

I overheard a conversation yesterday where in a span of 15 seconds a person went from literally yelling at the TV (FOX news of course) about Biden being a traitor because of five documents to Trump was the President and can declassify anything just by saying so.
