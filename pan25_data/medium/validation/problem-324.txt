house of representatives: we're impeaching your boy for trying to enlist the help of a foreign country to manufacture dirt on a political ally - also again for trying to overturn an election.
everyone: he brags about assaulting women, cheats on his wife (or wives), steals from his vets charity, stole from his political donors/emptied their bank accounts, mocks the disabled/bullies women/shits on veterans, and remember when he said he was for "taking all the guns first - making the laws after"?
so the fact that we finally have his tax returns after he desperately tried to hide them might matter if you care about corruption, laws and some semblance of decency - but his people are not remotely interested.
