True that!
Sasse and DeSantis are two peas in a pod.
So much of the Sasse description in the article is exactly like DeSantis’ beliefs.
Basically they believe that government is not there to help people.
And if you were just like them, America would be better for it.
They are both “legends in their own minds.” They are condescending hard core right wingers who no doubt love our present day Supreme Court.
They want an isolated America.
Christian western civilization only.
All hope is lost if these two take over — Florida and it’s schools are in real jeopardy.
I don’t understand the voting critique.
Most never Trump Republicans are quick to concede that he delivered a lot of the legislative wins they were hoping for.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
