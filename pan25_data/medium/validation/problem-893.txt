MTG being speaker depends on members of congress, nothing regular people can do about it either way for another two years.

Incompetent Marge is more like an orangutan with a shotgun.
McCarthy is a joke, a bad joke... but having Marge as speaker would be like handing a stick of dynamite and a box of matches to a toddler, and the GOP can not afford to swallow the damage she would do at this point in time.
Besides the same problems McCarthy has to deal with she'd have to as well.
That is if even a handful of Republican Congress members don't want her to be speaker, she isn't going to be speaker.
And I'd guess there'd be more than a handful that wouldn't want to be associated with her given how poorly the Trump style of politics did in the last election.
I'm not disagreeing with you whatsoever but she isn't some machiavellian political mastermind of skullduggery.
Any appearance of her being so is only because she managed to retain enough info about certain techniques from other more capable politicians.
The best she can do is perform a crude simulacrum of said techniques.
