The more impoverished and the more religious the country the more likely they don’t buy into any progressive views.
If you’re impoverished and religious … gg.
you made the most intelligent comment in this entire thread so succinctly!
i'm gay and i live and work in Yemen.
my national colleagues talk añl the time about how the Saudis are pushing extreme versions of Islam incessantly across Yemen (and much of the Middle East and North Africa) and they lament how just a few decades ago women dressed colorfully and could walk around in long skirts.
The average Yemeni is not hyper-religious and the current civil war really has nothing to do with religion, and is more of a power/land grab by the Houthis, Saudis, UAE, Qatar and Iran to control major shipping routes and some oil deposits.
I'm not super out at work, but some of my colleagues certainly know, and i work with one gay national guy who the women will take their hijabs off around when they are in private (technically a big no-no, but shows they accept him for what he is and dont see him as a threat).
Of course there is a ton of sexism and homophobia, but I don't think Yemen would be anywhere like it is now without Saudi Arabia's relentless influence.
An other example: Tunisia, the ONLY country in the arab world that survived the arab spring with a democracy, is struggling in heavy parts due to Saudi Arabia exerting its massive religious and political influence to kill said fledgling democracy it built as hard as it can.
And sadly, they are winning: they for example trapped the current Tunisian leaders in a catch 22 situation, by forcing them to pass some scary dissent supressing measures because SA were using islamist parties, some judges, and terrorists as proxy agitators.
Which gives them fuel to say Tunisia is a dictatorship again or about to be because it's way too open minded and their version of islam is the only way to survive.
Need I remind you that their version of islam was seen as heretically zealot EVEN DURING THE RELIGION'S INFANCY.
