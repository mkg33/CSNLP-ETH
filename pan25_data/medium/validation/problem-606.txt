Russian troops hunted Ukrainians by name, using lists prepared with the help of their intelligence services.
On the day Russia invaded Ukraine, Jordash got a call from a person with access to British intelligence who warned him that the Russians had lists of Ukrainian politicians and his wife - Svitlana Zalishchuk, a former member of parliament - was not safe.
Ukrainian prosecutors estimated from meticulous lists the Russians left behind that more than 800 people from the largest center alone had been taken into Russian-held territory or killed, Jordash said.
Compiling kill lists is practically a cultural staple of Russian power politics.
From the Tsar's Okhrana secret police forces, through the Soviet Cheka, NKVD, KGB, to the modern FSB, and a myriad of more obscure related agencies, extra-judicial murders and imprisonment has been a major tool of Russian state power and oppression for generations.
The Russians had lots of practice even before the Nazis.
They did this same stuff when they invaded Poland, kidnapped and executed tens of thousands of Polish people who were leaders in any way.
Beria is a bit of a standout among despicable company, IMO.
He seems to have truly enjoyed torture, rape, and murder, notably murdering those that resisted his torture and rapes.
Political violence was just his day job, it's what he did in the evenings that seems to have been his real passion.
