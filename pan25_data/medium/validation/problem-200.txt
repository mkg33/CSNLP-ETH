That small minority who have control are not currently in possession of a happiness that they'd then lose I can assure you.
I don't want you out there thinking that any of the way it is now makes any sense at all because it doesn't.
We're literally just ad hocking it through time and space waiting for someone to come along with the competence to correct us.
I say us as a matter of courtesy if you catch my drift .
All that money will be coming down to the rest of us 99% anytime now.
I call for Universal Basic Income!
Trust me when I say this the money will go back to the rich just as fast but at least the money would drop down.
As it should.
Giving (limited) money to poor people is like hitting the refresh button on supply and demand.
Let them raise prices as a weapon against people's buying power and let people choose whether they still want whatever they're selling.
The fact of the matter is that poor people having actual spending power as opposed to a small number racquets to choose from is actually good for rich people in the long run.
Problem is that rich people don't think long term despite what you may have heard.
