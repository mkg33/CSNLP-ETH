The only time I remember that Buttigieg is gay is when I see a headline from some sleazy rag like the NY Post bringing it up as a dog whistle for their mouth-breathing readers.
I seriously never think about Buttigieg's sexuality, because it's none of my business.
I care about the work he does on the taxpayer's dime, and he does a pretty good job.

Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Seriously OP, if gay sex bothers you so much, quit fantasizing about it.
If you can't, go suck a dick and be happy for the first time in your life.
