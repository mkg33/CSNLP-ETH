Kanye is being manipulated and taken advantage of by white supremacists, they absolutely love useful idiots with mental health issues so this is right up their alley, and aside from being already-famous Kanye is also now part of an organized far right movement so it's not surprising to see followers and terrorism etc.
This is why stochastic terrorists and right wing personalities constantly spewing bigotry to their demonstrably violent and deranged constituents need to be held liable.
I don’t practice civil law, and it’s been many years since I studied torts, but this shit is becoming an epidemic and those responsible need to be deterred, incapacitated, or rehabilitated before the GOP starts committing 9/11 or Oklahoma City level attacks.
I don’t know if some form of negligence is the theory or new legislation is required, or what, but these attacks are 100% foreseeable at this point.
I see Nick Fuentes standing two steps behind Kanye, and his politics are a matter of public record.
I believe he constitutes the entirety of Kanyes election campaign.
Nobody from NoI is involved in any way that I know of.
Kanye is definitely a pawn in this game, and that's not by accident.
How do you hold someone liable when they're clearly not sane?
His handlers are manipulating him and they're much more culpable for their crimes, but it becomes even more difficult to prove in court.
When I listen to his music, I find it hard to believe that he is clueless about what he is saying and doing.
Does he have mental health issues?
Yeah, probably.
But constantly saying he is mentally ill, is kinda giving him excuses for his behavior.
Not to mention he was a fucking billionaire.
He has access to the best medical treatment available.
And if he is prescribed medication and doesn't take it, that's on him.
It's a conscious choice.
Fuck him.
IDK.
Jessie's story was all about him getting news and playing up how he was attacked.
It rang idiotic because it was one of the coldest Chicago nights, like eyelashes freeze to each other cold.
Here?
The victim is remaining anonymous, but is over 60.
The attacker hopped on a bike:
Hungry disabled as a sign on a bike reads not at MAGA, but struggling and possibly begging for extra money.
Since they're not calling this a robbery, this seems more like an unstable person.
Smollet stuff played at racists attacking him with intent of hate crime and not a possibly mentally ill guy attacking a senior.
