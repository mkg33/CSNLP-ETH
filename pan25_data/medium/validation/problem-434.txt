It's not just driving the tanks.
The maintenance the tank crews have to do, as well as the actual mechanics is different from their current systems.
They've got to learn stuff like how to tension tracks, what the specs for drive sprockets are before they need to be replaced, etc etc.
How different is it from tank to tank (other than different crew layout I.e.
needing a loader)?
I mean it’s not like they’re near complex as something like a fighter.
They're fighting fir their lives and the lives of their family and countrymen.
They seem to quickly " master" everything They're given.
I don't know what I'm talking about but I imagine that modern tank should be an improvement over older tanks.
So if you know how to work with a tank it's just a matter of learning the new UI and the new features.
I can imagine the basics controls are easy to get used to, but what's more complicated is the features that other tanks may simply not have.
It's a matter of learning the features that gives those tanks an edge over the Russian ones.
