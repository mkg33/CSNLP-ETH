Not yet, infrastructure week is going to coincide with the release of their plan to fight inflation that they ran on, but never articulated.
I'm sure it will be soon...

It's like you have completely forgotten repeal and replace, they will have a health care plan in the next few weeks...
It's kind of hilarious and sad how they couldn't figure out any plan at all so they just gave up and just don't mention it anymore.
It was widely known that Hunter Biden was struggling w/drug and other issues.
According to a recent interview w/Lev Parnas (former Guiliani crime associate) he discusses how Russians and Republicans at the time saw Hunter's drug problems as an opportunity to develop kompromat on Hunter to use against his father.
A lack of empathy, inadequate conscience, and poor impulse control are narcissistic tendencies readily apparent in most Republicans today and so Republicans “taking things too far” is practically a guarantee, imo.
Regarding the Republicans Hunter’s laptop “investigation”, I would like to see the WH and Dems use the opportunity to highlight as loudly and often as possible how that entire affair was an Republican/Russian joint kompromat operation from the very start.

Since the election republicans have not addressed or even mentioned what they’re going to do to address crime.
Lev Parnas talks about how Russian operatives knowing how susceptible and unstable Hunter was offered him a seat on the board of Barisma, then later enticed him w/drugs and women at a birthday party thrown for the express purpose of videotaping the entire affair.
Parnas also mentions how Guiliani - as part of this operation - was aware of Hunter’s laptop long before it ever became public.
This sort of operation of creating fake scandals to use against the opposition is a longstanding practice cherished by Republicans, see the decades long history of James O’Keefe’s Orwellian-named “Project Veritas” for just one example.
The Republicans/Russians joint kompromat operation on Hunter Biden is something that I think merits further looking into as well as be publicized far more than it has been.

They didn’t run on conducting an endless series of political witch hunts while doing nothing about crime.
