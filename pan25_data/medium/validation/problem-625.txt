90% were murdered.
A comparitively small number emigrated, and mostly because their neighbors participated in murdering their community.
The Nazis divided the Jews and non-Jews so even after the Nazis were gone, there was no home for the Jews where they once had them.
We can't ever forget those who risked their lives in situations like these, when they could have easily walked away.
It could inspire future people in similar situations.
It's not easy at times to stand up to an overwhelming evil.
We cannon let even the first steps of fascism or flirtations with Nazism seep into our society.
By the time we realize we need to stand up, it is too late.
No, it didn't.
Hitler's entire concept of race and blood purity had him convinced that literally all Jewish people on earth needed to die if the Germans were to survive.
A single Jewish person left alive would be a failure in Hitler's eyes.
Let alone in an area that Hitler considered part of Germany.
(There were thousands of Jews still alive in Berlin by the end of WWII as well, tho obviously under the radar).
To label the Holocaust as "winning against the Jews" is quite frankly something that I imagine most Jewish people would at the least not agree with, if not be outright offended by.
