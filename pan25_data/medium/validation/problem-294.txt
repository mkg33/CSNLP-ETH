Other reports noted they were mixed with mail or , so it is probably the same story as always: postal carrier dumping mail or thief searched the bag for valuables then dumped the rest.
I’m a mountain resident- it’s definitely not our postal carriers.
We’ve been dealing with lots of mail theft.
All kinds - straight out of the delivery trucks, breaking into the PO Boxes - you name it - they aren’t afraid to be caught on camera.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Also, before you ask, ‘where are the police,’ look up Sheriff Laurie Smith.
And then realize there are no police.
It’s a free for all.
The CHP is responsible for policing our residential roads up here, but they only have 4 officers on duty for 3 freeways.
I found three news reports of postal carriers dumping ballots (and other mail) in the past few years.
New Jersey, Boston, and Kentucky.
In all 3 cases, the ballots had not yet been filled out.
The person requesting the ballot wouldn’t receive it, and would hopefully go vote in person.
The Santa Clara ballots are the only example I could find of “filled out” ballots being dumped.
That seems more serious to me, since those votes weren’t counted.
I’m a resident of the mountains.
We’ve been having problems with the local post offices being broken into - PO Boxes are being broken into after hours when the self-service is open, but the counter is closed.
We find our mail all over - and we have severe staffing shortages.
It’s not uncommon for the mail to be delivered after 9pm at night.
This is what DeJoy has brought to our mail service - not that problems didn’t exist prior, but he has certainly enhanced them.
Yes, they asked us not to use the blue boxes in the newspaper last week.
Lots of problems.
There are really small post offices up here in the mountains that have only 1 clerk.
We haven’t had any problems, but that doesn’t mean they don’t exist.
It’s not an issue in Santa Clara County.
We have ballot tracker where we can go online and see that our ballot has been received and counted.
There are lots of ways to remedy this situation and the registrar goes to great lenhs to make sure issues get resolved.
We don’t have mail theft in our post office.
Or even our local delivery UPS and Fed-x drivers.
These people are our neighbors and you have to understand that they deliver mail in the mountains.
I think it’s a struggle for the community to realize it’s not 1950 anymore.
We track our ballots.
It’s used pretty extensively.
The registrar will also re-send ballots out if they get ballots back that were found discarded.
But - this is a 75% Dem county so there weren’t a lot of close races.
