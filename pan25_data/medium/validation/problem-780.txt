Record energy company profits, and wholesale energy prices having been far below inflated retail prices for a while now.
Except they oversaw the closure of the biggest gas storage facility in the UK, making up for almost 50% of UK capacity.
The private company running the site approached the government , essentially saying, subsidise it or we are mothballing it.
People do not realise how critical gas is to our infrastructure.
Even if all our industry and domestic heating was purely electric, we still need a shit load of gas at a moments notice for grid stabilisation.
The amount of new load balancing gas powered engine sites being built at the moment is insane.
"The UK imported £19.6 billion of gas in 2021; a notable increase of 312% from £4.8 billion in 2020.
The UK exported £3.4 billion of gas in 2021, increasing by 167% from £1.3 billion in 2020.

I wouldn't call exporting £3.4 billion of gas, which is roughly 17% of how much in £ we imported in 2021 tiny.
Admittedly its a simplistic view, as it doesn't take into consideration the price of what each cubic foot was traded at.

"The UK lacks gas storage capacity for overall demand.
Europe has roughly 105 bcm of gas storage capacity, equating to 22 per cent of annual consumption.
By contrast, the UK has just 0.9 bcm of gas storage relative to around 80 bcm.

No one blames the government for the war with Ukraine.
We blame them for weak position we find ourselves in to deal with the war in Ukraine.
Starting with a decade of austerity to achieve fuck all but a worse position than we already started in.
Calling a brexit vote when there was no need/nobody calling for it in the first place.
Rinsing our economy during covid while lining the pockets of all those close to the government.
Refusal to pay nurses and ambulance staff a reasonable salary two years after we lauded them as heroes.
I could go on and on, it’s just too depressing.
Haven't heard anyone complaining so far.
Energy costs probably have gone up but I couldn't tell you how much.
So far this is one of the mildest winters I have experienced.
We are expecting 15°C on the 31st of December and many ski resorts don't have any snow.
