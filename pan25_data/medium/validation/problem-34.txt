He had to be personally massaged into doing it by the head of the RNC, after a private conversation that Trump emerged from very happy.
I can only imagine what they told him to get him to go along with it (perhaps convinced him he was going to win anyway).
Omg Twin I was just coming here to say that I didn't think I'd enjoy all this reality t.v.
"mean boy" stuff...but here I am.
More drama, please.
Pass the snack bowl, please.
I'm waiting for an actual, literal explosion of someone's head; Trump, DeSantis, McConnel, any of their heads.
I actually think that the fact that one of them is now Donald Trump, and he isn't likely to be the winner this time, makes everything different.
EVERYTHING.
That unity has mostly been a result of disciplined messaging from the overall party, lockstep unison from those running it on the really big fights (like the presidency).
Everything we know about the GOP's ability to fall in line and rally to a cause is based on the discipline among their political leaders.
I don't think the voters necessarily do it on their own -- it's that all of the various big mouths and big heads come together in the end and agree to lead their flocks together, even if they were arguing during the primaries.
Donald Trump, however, is not a career politician, and has no particular loyalty to the GOP as an organization.
All the Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio supporters were dutifully instructed to line up behind Trump in 2016 when it was time to do so, even after the way Trump shit on them during the primaries.
Trump is not going to show the same courtesy, even if it is the rational thing to do if he ever actually cared about the conservative agenda.
The ironic thing is, Trump himself has always been a RINO, when it comes to what used to be expected of Republicans.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
That trend is going to finally see its first exception.
I remember during the 2016 primaries that he was refusing to sign a loyalty pledge for the RNC that promised to support whoever won the Republican primary.
Every other candidate but him was fine with it.
Trump does what Trump wants, and he's not going to be asking Republicans to be good and loyal and vote for the party in 2024 if he isn't leading it.
He will not care if it all burns down around him, and there are a core group of his supporters who he will NEVER give his blessing to if it comes to getting behind a Trump competitor in the interest of saving their side overall.
Trump never acts in the interest of the common good -- not even the American conservative concept of the "common good.
