And as mentioned, in such a scenario Finland absolutely would have the capabilities to cripple Russia's trade routes out of St. Petersburg, while also striking the city itself devastatingly, making it a ruinous war for Russia in terms of cost.
Finland can today do the things that Stalin invaded Finland to ensure it wouldn't be able to do with the technology of the day then.
Worse, Finland would have one geographic advantage that would be even more devastating, and is one of the primary reasons Finland entering NATO is so important: With minimal forces, Finland could in practice cut off Murmansk (and Russia's northern submarine bases) from the rest of Russia.
Why?
Because Murmansk basically only has one road between it and the rest of Russia, and it's nearly impossible for Russia to properly defend if Finland decided to start disrupting it.
Infiltration teams and air strikes alike could turn it into a logistical hell for Russia, while Russia wouldn't really be able to do the same thing the other way around.
A bit historical bacground, Finland was under enormous political pressure from USSR after WW2, and the fear was that Finland would be forced to join Warsaw Pact if Sweden did join NATO.
So Sweden did not join NATO.
