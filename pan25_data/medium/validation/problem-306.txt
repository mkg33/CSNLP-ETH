the patriots offered to poland would be controlled by Bundeswehr (german military) and cant lawfully operate them in Ukraine, so its not really a possibility.
was about to say, Patriot is a US system, they get to decide if such systems can be transferred to non NATO/ non-Patriot using countries.
The question then is, is anything within the Patriot system sensitive enough that it would be a major issue if it fell into russian hands?
Thats a question only the US can answer.
.
But the status quo has changed dramatically and after World War III almost began last week, it would now be surprising if the US blocked the transfer, especially if conditions are imposed that limit them to northwestern Ukraine.
i could see a sort of Ring-Tausch again, whereby Germany can transfer its systems to another NATO country and said third country transfers older tech to Ukraine as was done with tanks etc earlier.
It's possible they've been training Ukrainian crews on these systems for a while and have just been waiting for the right conditions to deliver them.
But even if not, unfortunately it appears there will still be a war going on in Ukraine in 6 months from now, so might as well start training them now..
