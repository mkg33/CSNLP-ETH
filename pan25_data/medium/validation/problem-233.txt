- Santos is a fugitive from justice in a foreign country, thus afoul of INS regulations.
Trump illegally imported workers for his businesses from Portugal and Estonia.
The INS could make a case against Trump also.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
- Mary Trump described how Donald paid other people to do his homework and take his exams for him in high school and college.
How different is this from Santos' totally fabricated high school and college histories?
- Trump sent goons to his doctor's office to take his medical records.
This probably was primarily to destroy any X-rays or other records that showed he never had bone spurs, and that he illegally evaded the draft during the Viet Nam War, but possibly this was also to conceal his history of Venereal diseases, and prescription narcotics used (Percoset and amphetamines).
- I don't know if Santos has a drug dealing history, but Trump's company, "Trump Special Services" (for high rollers at his casinos) was caught with 1500 kilos of coke in his helicopter.
- Santos has a history of writing bad checks and stolen checks on other peoples' accounts.
Trump has a history of writing bad checks based on stock frauds.
- Trump and Santos both have histories of charities fraud.
Trump used charitable contributions to the Trump Charitable Foundation to pay his legal fines connected with building code violations, and for catering and decorating at his properties.
Santos used contributions to his fake animal rescue charity to pay real estate bills and for food.
- I don't know if Santos has a history of corrupting judges, but when Trump was put on trial for dealing cocaine, the judge in the case was Maryanne Trump, his sister, under her married name.
Charges against Donald were dismissed.
- Both Trump and Santos have lied about their maximum net worth, exaggerating by about a factor of ten in each case.
- I don't know if Santos has a history of illegal arms trafficking, but Trump Azerbaijan is a warehouse.
No people ever stayed there.
According to news reports, it was financed by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, and it is used to smuggle arms into Iran, including the missile/drone guidance systems used to attack Ukraine by Russian forces.
- I don't know if Santos was ever destitute, but Trump has said his net worth was less than zero at times during the 1990s (until he perpetrated a massive stock fraud, where he issued worthless stock to his creditors).
- Donald Junior said his father was bailed out by Russian oligarchs, in what was almost certainly money laundering.
The sources of Santos' campaign funds are obscure,^ but the evidence points to money laundering, though whether the source is Russia, drug cartels, or other sources is not yet known.
- No-one has accused Santos of rape or molestation.
Trump has been accused twice of child molestation, and over 15 times of either rape or forced intimate touching of adult women.
He has also confessed on tape, when he did not know the _Entertainment Tonight_ microphones were live.
He has denied these acts publicly, so either he lied about doing it, or lied about not doing it.
Actually, looking at the list of accusations, all backed up by evidence against both persons, I wound have to say that Trump takes the prize for breadth of lies.
/ Edit: New information has been uncovered.
.
Contributors include migrant smugglers, Trump donors, and a Russian oligarch, which translates to the FSB/former KGB/Putin.
So, like Trump, he is either a Russian stooge or a Russian agent.
You choose your favorite term.
And just to prove about the breadth.
The weather lie I'm referring to is the other weather lie, not that weather lie.
In fairness I don't believe George Santos has received one hundredth the coverage and investigation as Donald Trump, it's not a lack of lies it's a lack of getting caught.
And that's totally fair, Trump's older and became the friggin president, Santos is some jackass house rep who I'd bet money on being out in 2 years time.
I could believe it, if only because I don't believe he has a snowball's chance in hell at winning reelection after being exposed on this level of fraud.
I don't think you realize how much trump lied and lies.
Sometimes I forget and then remember that 90% of what he says doesn't even make the news because it wouldn't even matter.
The likes of Dennis Hastert were tolerated because the likes of Jim Jordan and Linsey Graham had something to cover up, so they covered for people who were worse.
This network of thieves, liars, and other kinds of criminals are so numerous and cover for each other so effectively that honest people run the risk of being outvoted if they tried to clean things up.
There were retired FBI and CIA officials who said Trump could not have gotten any form of security clearance, except by bypassing the process through election.
I recall hearing this on at least 2 news shows, when Jared and Ivanka were denied security clearances, and Donald overruled the FBI, in 2017.
