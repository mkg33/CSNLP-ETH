None of that justifies under reporting though.
Once people are aware of over-reporting they can do something about it and push for change.
However, if Fox and the rest of the right wing media eco-system pick up on the fact that a few Democratic areas skew it the other way, they can wave it off as 'both sides pull this trick, it doesn't matter'.

It's better for everyone to tell the truth and it helps insulates you from an attack like that.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

Interesting to see that the skewed reporting rates occur on both sides of the aisle even if Republicans leaning areas are more likely to do so.
