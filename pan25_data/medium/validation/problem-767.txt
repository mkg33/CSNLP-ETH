Or if the West is afraid of war, is China interested in the global depression that will be caused by all the sanctions, or the severe food shortages in China that will be caused by losing access to global trade ?
An invasion of Taiwan isn't even possible anytime soon.
It would take years for China to build a proper fleet for an amphibious assault.
It would take years for them to wear down the islands defenses enough with missile bombardment, considering much of Taiwans military infrastructure is underground.
They would lose most of the industry of the island, and many ships to mines.
Submarines, and more even if the US didn't get involved.
They would likely lose enough soldiers to severely hurt public opinion at home.
Even if there were no direct military intervention, sanctions would cripple china's already teetering economy.
Unlike Russia, China can't produce enough materials to power itself.
Unlike Russia, China can't feed itself.
Right now Taiwan is useful to China as a political lightning rod, and that's where it will stay.
Worry more about disinformation campaigns, investments to try and sway popular support, and election interference more than outright invasion.
I remember reading somewhere (can't remember where) that it is a mistake to form strategies based on an assessment of what your enemies 'would' do, because this automatically introduces a bias to your considerations.
Rather, you should try to think about what your enemies could do - could China launch an invasion of Taiwan even though they are not by any means prepared?
They sure could.
A blockade is all China would do.
I don't understand why people don't listen at all to what China has been saying and posturing.
China doesn't build landing crafts.
That's why everyone is saying they can't invade.
They don't plan to.
Instead they spend their fortunes on missiles and boats that can ram ships.
What they are planning to do is a century long blockade.
They don't care about the island so much as they want a surrender.
Starving out an island is vastly easier than invading it.
They won't fire a single shot without getting fired up on first.
It'll be a giant game of chicken with the taiwanese people starving from being unable to import anything.
After 100 years it'll be an empty island they just walk into.
People really don't understand China's patience.
This Taiwan conflict has been going on for 70 years already, they won't mind double that to complete their blockade.
And if someone attacks them during the blockade?
They'll rain missiles on everything that the country has in the area.
A straight up confrontation would be stupid, they know that.
But how long is anyone willing to just volley ballistics at each other?
Can you out last the patience of China?
I'm Taiwanese, I hope this day never comes.
I just really want people to fucking understand what the actual plan is and not just some war games where China fights like a normal adversary.
They won't and don't plan to.
The real secret is they have been open about it and we don't listen.
I don't know.
But that's why China wants to be able to blockade the south china seas.
Like I said if you pay the slightest attention, they have been incredibly open about their intentions.
It's easy to say create a humanitarian air bridge, but do we understand the costs of doing that?
There's a reason in shipping boats are king.
Could we really supply enough from the air to keep Taiwan Operating?
Can we air lift enough to keep their economy going?
Will people import from Taiwan when the cost of air shipping is priced in?
However, these are the contingencies we need to plan for.
This needs to be figured out before the blockade.
Not preparing for war.
Oh totally, they're actually quite happy to keep the charade.
In my opinion that's the USA and Taiwan's best option too.
Let's just keep this charade of one China going to avoid conflicts.
China will never feel strong enough to pull off the blockade as long as their citizens are fat and happy.
They'll keep kicking that can as long as they can because in truth, they just want to use Taiwan to show their influence and if Taiwan blows smoke up their ass, China is perfectly happy to keep talking and doing nothing.
The problem is, Taiwan never really supported the US.
If you look at history, one of the main reasons China was able to get as much stolen information as they could is because Taiwan bought them from US and sold it to China.
This kept US from sending better or more advanced equipment.
Ultimately leading to the current situation where China out classes Taiwan alone easily.
That's because CCP talks about how they could invade and retake Taiwan if they wanted, but prefer an amicable resolution.
