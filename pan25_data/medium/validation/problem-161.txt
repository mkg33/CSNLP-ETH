The United Kingdom is somewhat of an oddity compared to the United States, the Russian Federation, India, and the PRC because practically the entirety of the UK's nuclear arsenal is concentrated in the form of SLBMs launched from submarines.
Plus, stealth bombers can be used for non-nuclear purposes.
Also, if I recall, the RAF as it stands lacks actual dedicated long range bombers.
Whether that's a pressing problem for British military doctrine I don't know but I'm pretty sure the last of the Avro Vulcans have been pulled out of service decades ago.
Most air forces have moved towards using multi-role fighters.
The RAF doesn't need a long-range stealth bomber.
Any threats posed to the UK and her interests are reachable with modern multirole fighter from the homeland, allied airbases or a carrier strike group.
Large bombers have become largely superfluous with the advent of accurate long-range cruise missiles, and more recently drones.
It makes sense for the US to build large stealth bombers, but smaller countries like the UK are better off with missiles and drones because of the costs involved.
It's a large 6th generation aircraft with big sensors, acting as a stealthy AWACS for stealth fighters is a likely use.
UK and Aus could potentially operate a small number as electronic support platforms that are more survivable than current generation airliner based airborne sensor systems.
Also a stealthy AWACS even if detected, gives it survivability when under attack, if enemy slings long range AA missiles at it, cut the radar, engage jamming and decoys, and the stealthy airframe disappears instantly into the noise unlike the UFO dish carrying airliners that are rather big targets to radar.
I'd be really surprised if the US was willing to sell its best super secret stealthy kit.
Years ago Congress blocked export of the F22, even to trusted allies like the UK.
Maybe because they want to base some in the UK and Australia?
Pretty sure they have B52s stationed in the UK, and soon nuclear weapons again.
So why not B21s and their nukes?
F22 is still better than the F35 in a lot of ways with a much smaller radar cross section despite being a lot older.
F35 is not the best the Americans have.
Yes and it's a better figher and stealthier.
Compared to the best tech that's available, F22 in 90s was by far and away the best.
F35 in the 2020s is not.
Excellent, yes.
But not the best.
The equivalent would be the US selling NGAD.
Relative to the stealth technology the Americans have now, is F35 better than F22 was back in the 90s?
No.
They have better.
That's why they'll export F35.
The best will be kept for the F22's replacement.
That might make sense for Australia, but not the UK.
There aren't any credible threats to the UK right now.
Russia has been shown to be weak, China is too far away.
