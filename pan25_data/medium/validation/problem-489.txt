What I’m saying is that Democrats, the politicians, are less popular than the policies they support.
I think Ranked Choice Voting would be a better solution than abolishing political parties.
A Democratic governor elected in a red state is somewhat divorced from Democrats in federal elections (HoR, Senate).
As a result, they can’t be pinned as easily to Democratic boogeymen by their opponents, as they control the state.
Plus, in smaller states, it’s easier to do old fashioned politics to dispel the myths about you.
That’s why KY, LA, and KS can have D governors and be red.
They aren’t “beholden” to Democratic leadership in the House and Senate.
In addition to that, in Senate elections, people are voting less for specific candidates and more for which party they want to control the Senate.
So even if Beshear himself ran against McConnell, the state would probably still re-elect McConnell because they’d hate the idea of a Democratic Senate more than they like Beshear personally.
He’s a seven time elected senator.
Regardless of whether or not they personally hate him or not, McConnell is a very powerful man in Washinon with a lot of seniority in the Senate.
That alone will garner more votes than a newbie candidate - party aside.
