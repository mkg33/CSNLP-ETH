House Republican leadership is largely white, male, and anchored in the South, and could hamper the party’s ability to appeal to an increasingly diverse nation.
That profile stands in sharp contrast to the previous Democratically controlled chamber where minorities and women played larger roles.
Despite promises by Republicans over the decades to diversify their ranks and better reflect changing national demographics, Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and his lieutenants haven’t diversified the top of congressional committees that have huge influence over Americans of all stripes on issues ranging from taxes to housing and transportation.

And it could present challenges in winning re-election in 2024, a presidential election year when a greater share of Americans will likely be voting, including minorities and women.
