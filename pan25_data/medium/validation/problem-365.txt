Is it possible to detect that there’s a vpn etc, and so be aware that the perceived location is unreliable?
Wishful thinking, perhaps, but I was thinking notice of that fact would be enough.
It's very interesting reading all the comments on here and then the comments on this video about the same incident.
Also a good example of how trivially cheap it is for nation-state wealth to influence sentiment with sock puppets.
I do wish the big tech firms would roll out some sort of geo tagging, so by default your comment is tagged with your country location, or if it’s obscured (vpn) or opted out, to at least give a sense.
The thing is Canada doesn't have a Fox news per say so they have no local outlet to spew their BS towards.
Of course they also subscribe to fox news, which is likely why there so many of them becoming dumber and dumber.
The local Convoy blockades citing US amendments, politicizing just about everything.
The Paul Pelosi attacker is Canadian and buying all the dumb shit fox news is selling.
