The logic by the lower Court indicates that the police can be sued in the future since there is now (because of a different case, I assume) clear SCOTUS guidance that this is protected speech.
So the police have the right to arrest you if you criticize them and you can't do anything about it so long as they claim you're disrupting their operations.
That's fucked up.

It is a bad decision, but doesn't give carte blanche to arrest any parody maker.
But it comes way too close to doing so.
