Nancy Mace went to The Citadel, the military college of SC.
At the time it was an all male school.
The previous year Shannon Faulkner enrolled, showed, and dropped out within a week or two after a lenhy court battle against the school for not admitting females.
The year after that, my freshman year, Mace and three other women enrolled.
During my freshman year, Mace’s dad, General Mace was brought in as the Commandant of Cadets.
Apparently when she enrolled, she actually came in as an academic sophomore, so she could be “the first female to graduate from The Citadel”.
For what that’s worth, it did cause a lot of butt hurt for some of the good ol’ boy network, so that was nice.
