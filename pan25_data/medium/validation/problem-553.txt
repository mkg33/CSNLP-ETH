If Russians did it why none of the Baltic states is providing any evidence for it, Baltic sea is now called NATO pond.
All of the Baltic countries except for Russia are NATO members of partners of NATO, Baltic sea is one of the most heavily monitored seas in the world.
In it Russia has a very narrow corridor though which it can navigate its ships, same applies for Airspace over Baltic.
So it would be very hard for Russians to conduct covert sabotaging missions on this pipeline, additionally sabotage of pipeline has been done inside of Swedish territorial waters near the island of Bornholm which does host Swedish coast guard and naval personnel monitoring these parts of their aqua-territorial space.
SO taking into account all of the above, there should be a lot of indicators of evidence that Russians did it, such as: satellite imaginary, intercepted radio communication, vessel movement etc.
All which could have been easily documented by any of the NATO members states or its partners in Baltic's.
SINCE all of these countries are silent or are playing dumb and ignorant on the event itself, it is a strong indicator that one or more of these countries have participated or known what has been happening and are now silent on this.
- Analyzes that have now been carried out show traces of explosives on several of the foreign objects that were found.
The advanced analysis work continues to be able to draw safer conclusions about the incident, says Mats Ljungqvist.
The explosions at Nord Stream 1 and 2 was sabotage, says Chamber Prosecutor Mats Ljungqvist in a press release.
