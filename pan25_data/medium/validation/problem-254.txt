There are so many wars happening right now.
But the reason why nobody calls these "WW3" is because all of these are proxy wars by powerful nations.
For example, the ongoing civil war in Yemen is actually a "war" between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
One faction gets supplied by Saudi Arabia, and then the other faction gets supplied by Iran.
So basically it's an "informal" or "proxy" war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
There are so many wars, conflicts, and insurgencies all across the Middle East and Africa.
In almost all of them, you'll be able to trace at least two powerful countries supplying different groups and militias with various weapons.
Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey all participate in proxy wars across the Middle East.
France is involved in Africa.
The US almost everywhere.
Your guess is as good as mine but Russia has used the Balkan region as a tool to lash out at the west.
They fuel instability to throw a monkey wrench in the wests efforts to integrate the western Balkans into the EU.
Could be a distraction or something more.
