Part of it is a preference thing, sort of?
In Europe, Asia and indeed it looks like Mexico as well, they think dry cleaning the eggs is enough and that the benefits of keeping them unwashed are better.
Which I agree with, because the eggs shell keeps out the diseases and you shouldn't be eating eggshells or raw eggs anyway.
We don't require meat to be washed even though it's theoretically pretty gross (although washed meat does exist), we just make sure companies aren't selling infected meat.
I'm pretty sure cleaning with water isn't enough to make them considered "washed eggs" but either way these eggs aren't gross looking.
In general, be courteous to others.
