“New York historically has been a state that did not keep up with other states’ election administration and voting reforms,” Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause New York, a nonprofit that works on democracy-related issues, said.
Worse than that, in the dem proposed voting rights bill CA & NY would be placed on preclearance while many red states that were on it would be released.
This is due to the formula being updated to recent violations.

People voted for ranked-choice voting and the way they implemented it is a joke.
It’s only available in the primaries, while the general is the same Pepsi vs Coke election.
The point of ranked-choice voting is that you can vote for a third-party candidate without concern of it being a spoiler.
If you lived in Kansas during Brownback’s governorship, that would answer your question.
He was the first governor to experiment the Trickle Down economy directly on state level, and predictably was a total disaster.
In NV, there's a voter initiative to introduce ranked choice voting for elections.
It has to pass twice to amend the state constitution.
It passed once in 2022 and has to pass again in 2024.
Both dems and republicans oppose it.
I applaud the efforts in the article but sometimes even dem lawmakers are the ones against good reforms.
They tried.
Can't get past the filibuster in the senate.
Didn't have enough votes to kill the filibuster.
The voters in 24 states or so can bypass the lawmakers and do it themselves with ballot initiatives.
Voters in FL voted to restore voting rights to felons that completed their sentence.
The dept of elections asked the legislature for more funding but they declined.
If all eligible were to apply for restoration it would take till 2060 to clear them all, that's if the staff worked all holidays and weekends.
It's also before republicans required all debts to be paid but there's no easy way to tell if they have.
So if they get the vote restored and vote, Governor DeSantis has a taskforce to arrest them as they somehow have data that others do not and managed to catch some people who got the vote restored but were not actually eligible.
We've seen red states move urban voting stations outside the urban area at the last minute on the pretext of construction work at the usual venue.
But it turns out there is no such work.
If you obstacle course the whole process then you will have lower turnout.
It's not really a surprise why the states with lowest turnout are like that.
We've seen federal rulings in states like NC where republicans were found to have targeted black voters with surgical precision to suppress their votes.
Mobile polling stations on campuses?
Pass laws to make them less mobile so they capture less votes.
Student ID allowed for voting?
Let's add in new arbitrary requirements to render many of them invalid by messing with the years it is valid as a requirement for no reason eg.
Wisconsin.

The right to vote isn't that secure in the constitution.
It tells you the basis on which you cannot be denied it.
Parts of the voting rights act have been slashed away by the supreme court.
For example, racial gerrymandering is still illegal but the court can't agree on a standard to interfere and will accept any excuse the state gives.
If they say it was partisan and not racial they will let it thru.
So it seems the only way is if the lawmakers are openly blatant about it, for the court to overturn it.
