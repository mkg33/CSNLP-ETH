Not defending republicans on this because when it comes to immigration there are competing camps in the party who have different goals and so it’s generally just easier for them to agree on keeping the status quo.
BUT, at the same time I have yet to see a deal put forward by dems or the gop that would actually be considered a fair compromise.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
This “deal”, what?
Trades amnesty in exchange for increased BP wages and a one year extension on title 42?
This is hardly what I would call a compromise.
I hear you but from my POV the Republicans have moved the goalpost on immigration compromise so many times, it's really sucked the trust out of everyone.
Just 3-4 years ago, it was funding for the wall that was paramount.
We had a shutdown over it.
A deal was supposedly struck in the WH which included wall funding.
Then the deal was pulled by the WH.
Also, Democrats are more than willing to compromise.
Who do you see having press conferences jumpstarting conversations and urging the need to work on immigration compromise?
Sen Durbin has been trying to do something for 20+ yrs.
On the opposite end you have the GOP threatening to jail the DHS chief, instantly pour cold water over a bipartisan framework (i.e.
John Cornyn), shutting the door on anything bipartisan, saying "my way or the highway."
These two are just not the same.
