With companies like Roblox and Huntsman Corporation doing business still in Russia, it's probably best to start looking into what exactly they are supplying and execute accordingly first.
So is invading another country without UN authorization, the reality is that rules and laws only exist to those that have them enforced against them.
If you piss a country off enough they will no longer respect the standard rules of doing business with others.
One form of this is launching an invasion, another is seizing foreign assets and using them against the nominal owner-country.
Similar things happened within many countries during the Second World War, ala Ford and Coca-Cola operations in Germany continuing and being important to the war effort there.
Using the sized money from crooked Russian Oligarchs and having it go towards helping Ukraine instead of towards Republican’s quest to make things worse in America is a win for sane people.
Because the Russians who the money was seized from didnt roll back regulations on trains a few years before this happened?
In one respect, yes (you do “illegal” thing, I do “illegal” thing).
In another respect the seizure of assets from unfriendly countries has often occurred during times of hostility, as invading another country’s ally often has consequences, and international law and standards are essentially maintained by the desire to keep good relations between countries and to maintain a credible and safe investing environment.
If relations between countries break down as we see currently, countries become more likely to ignore their previous treaties.
For some additional reading on the subject I would recommend this article and The other articles that it links to.
America has plenty of funds to fix its own problems...but only middle class people were affected, so we'll worry about it later (if ever).
