It did not go well apparently as China publicly chastised the US for shooting down the Chinese balloon over US airspace.
China should have just apologized as there was no denying it was their balloon or that it was over US.
Had China informed the US that balloon was off course ahead of time, it might have a legal or moral argument.
But calling US aggressive and hysterical was not honest or helpful.
Consider how China would respond if it was a US balloon.

Game on, US should supply the F165's and anti-aircraft weapons to stop Russian bombing of Ukraine and to push Russia out including Crimea.
It is a proxy war the US and EU will win.
