Its delusional to think this guy and others like him without heated driveways are shoveling them.
They have guys come in with a truck, clear it out, and drop salt.
This one guy did the heating thing sure and you can rally against him but he did not do it as an alternative to shoveling himself I can guarantee.
I just question if its really more emissions than the likely alternative which is guys in a truck pushing it out and salting.
The salting is a big part along with wear and tear from the truck as resurfacing will be a nice emission thing.
Anyway I don't really know but I would sorta like to know like definatively but I have that with a lot of eco things like recycling.
Still I don't have a heated driveway but I do have a shared one that is cleared out by guys in a truck.
Ultimately I will do what I guess to be the best.
Some are slam dunks like walking, cycling, not traveling unnecessarily, etc.
Good luck trekking out there after society has collapse and getting passed the autonomous guns, that is providing youâ€™ve saved an offline paper copy of where these hideout shelters are located (NZ is a big destination).
