I mean, I never said it wasn't better that they are or aren't in NATO, what I'm saying is that Russia in their current status wouldn't be able to stand a chance against the Finns.
I believe the U.S. has already promised them protection during the wait.
In a very real sense they are benefiting from NATO without being in it and having the obligations members do.
To be honest I would rather be in NATO for 100% confirmed.
I already see the allies hesitating to support when Russia invades because they don't want to start WW3 .
If Russia can't succeed in their 3 day "operation" on Ukraine, they're definitely not gonna take down a military specifically designed to counter them.
(Finland).
There is no risk to these countries now anyway.
Putin would have to be suicidal to attack them short term.
Even without help i doubt Russia could take Finland and Sweden at the same time, as he is waging a loosing battle in the south west.
However.
Longer term, the nuclear umbrella need to be enforced.
Making it not possible at all to attack.
Why?
Since i dont think any of us want our children to grow up in a totalitarian state world order.
Something China and Russia are advocating.
The US was never expecting the rough terrains of Afghanistan, or Vietnam for that matter, and Korea didn't really have a winner regardless so that one is irrelevant.
Look at Finland, however, who literally only trains their military to defeat Russia in the event of invasion.
Their past proves they aren't easy to take them down.
