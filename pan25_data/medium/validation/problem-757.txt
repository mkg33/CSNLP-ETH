'However, Medvedev refused to specify exactly what crimes Wagner soldiers — who played a key role in battles around the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut — committed, or whether he gave any criminal orders as a Wagner commander.
Medvedev served as the leader of the first squadron of the 4th platoon of Wagner’s 7th Assault Detachment and fought near Bakhmut, according to Russian human rights NGO Gulagu.net.

“All these newspapers used to have foreign bureaus,” he said.
“Now they don’t.
They call us to explain to them what’s happening in Moscow and Cairo.
Most of the outlets are reporting on world events from Washinon.
The average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns.
That’s a sea change.
They literally know nothing.”.
It is impossible to underestimate the lack of knowledge of journalists regarding subjects they report on outside of the industry of journalism itself.
They generally know basic writing, journalism, and that's about it.
Media have been using the term on purpose for clicks, in Norway he was immediately described as a squad leader which is synonymous with corporal or specialist.
So the issue here is that they are calling him a commander when he is a fairly low ranking individual.
In US army terms, he could have less than a few years of service and no formal leadership training.
He would have no authority to make big picture decisions.
NCOs and officers have special schools they go to in order to learn how to lead.
Even then, lieutenants don't really lead.
They assist a captain who leads a company, which is 4-5 platoons and each platoon has 3-4 squads.
Captain is the lowest rank that would actually constitute a "commander" as they are the first rank who actually holds the title of Commanding Officer.
Most laypeople would be looking for someone with the rank of lieutenant colonel, which lead a battalion of 1,000+ troops, before they really start considering them a commander.
Ironically, Colonel Sanders only held the rank of private.
He was given the honorary title of Kentucky Colonel after his business success by Kentucky Governor Lawrence Wetherby.
Sure, "Commander" may be a title given for an ad-hoc role (like "Captain" in the Navy - both a title AND a rank), but unless the person is in the Navy, "Commander" isn't a rank.
It's as generic as the word "leader".
At least with "leader" or "commander", it is generally best (like most militaries do) to say what size unit is being commanded or led: "squad leader", "battalion commander", etc.
and people aren't generally addressed that way except to explain their role.
Well, there is always an opportunity to learn.
So here you go in terms of the US army, the easy version.
A squad is normally lead by a corporal or specialist depending on what military and branch of service they are with.
That is an enlisted rank, which is the lowest of ranks.
It is the highest enlisted rank before you become a non-commissioned officer.
They are above privates which are the lowest ranks.
Non-commissioned officers are sergeants.
There are many different types of sergeants ranging for a regular old sergeant which is the lowest non-commission all the way up to the rank of sergeant major which is the highest rank of enlisted ranks.
Above enlisted ranks you have officers.
Officers are 2nd lieutenant, 1st lieutenant, captain, major, lieutenant colonel, colonel, and different grades of generals.
