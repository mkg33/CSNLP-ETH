We aren't Jewish, but once sent one of our kids to a Jewish preschool.
The place had security built into the building and the architecture, staff trained on security and an armed roaming security staff member.
When the kid started going to public schools I felt like we had lost so much security.
School shootings are still a threat but the public school buildings can be ingressed or egressed by ANYONE from 365 degrees and no security guard.
If something were to happen it would just be "call the police and see how many victims were created until police showed up.
".
