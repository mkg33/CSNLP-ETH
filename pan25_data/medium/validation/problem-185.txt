For the context, the Libcunts spent the last decade ignoring the entirety of the Asia Pacific region, allowing China to increase its grip.
We're talking the most basic of diplomatic and aid missions that we'd been doing for decades, if not a century.
Scomo & Co just...didn't bother.
Mostly because Scomo (and the who Liberal party) is, of course, a useless cunt.
Can't even cook chicken.
But there was also the usual lazy right-winger bullshit of "Look how bad \insert external threat to country that government of the day can't be responsible for but can only protect from is!
", drumming up a non-domestic crisis that can be used to distract and manipulate domestic sentiment.
It is true China has been belt-and-roading and debt-trapping these nations hard.
But it's also true that a lot of them fell for it because, well, Australia, who had traditionally been the regional (soft) power, had abandoned our post.
The shutdown of Radio Australia's shortwave broadcast done purely out of right-wing "let's cut some budget!"
starve-the-beast bullshit was a prime example, with Vanuatu expressing concern.
In a region beset by hurricanes and tsunamis, Radio Australia was often the only source of weather information when local transmitters were down.
The frequencies were immediately snapped up by China.
Yea but not really, things were fine the last government were just a bunch of smooth brains that wanted to look tough and were unnecessarily aggressive in their actions towards China in a bid to pony up to America.
Several Pacific allies (including America and, IIRC, France and Britain) expressed serious concern about our lack of interest in the region over the last decade.
The very first thing the Labor government did when they won last year was send Penny Wong (the best Prime Minister we'll never have...) around the Pacific on a whirlwind tour to try to undo some of the neglect, something the last government couldn't even be bothered to do.
It’s better when things run smooth, we are by no means Chinas friend, but we also don’t need to be aggressive.
It was stupid.
Australia is one of the few countries that, if Necessary the US would go to hell and back with.
Any enemy of or threat to Australia will be treated as an enemy of or threat to the U.S. your government was not trying to Pony up to anybody, they were supporting their closest ally.
Any of our allies that have benefited from US dominance over the decades and are not willing to take a hard stance against countries trying to move into our sphere of influence can fuck off.
I personally think we should just go back to being isolationists so everybody can be reminded of what the world is like with an authoritarian nation is calling the shots.
Is that hypocritical?
Probably.
