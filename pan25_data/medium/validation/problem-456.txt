But potentially with much longer range -- the Iranian Shahed-136 has a range of 2000 km, for example.
> Ukraine has also raised just over one million US dollars, nearing the goal of $1,250,000, for the "Shahed Hunter system," which is being created to counter Iranian-made Shahed-136 kamikaze drones used by Russia.
Ukraine hopes the anti-drone system will detect and intercept drones and jam their GPS signals.
Supposedly the Iranian drones would be destroyed by "ultra-fast drones" released by the Shahed Hunter.
In a way they have these already, there's videos of their quadcopter drones shooting down Russian quadcopter drones.
It's probably just a shotgun tube or someshit, but baby steps.
They just need to invent reusable melee drones to pursue the slow-flying Shahed drones and destroy or jam the propellers.
The problem with deliberately colliding into another drone is that the attack drone may also be lost.
So it's better to instead get close and attack with a machine gun.
some of these drones are worth less than what russia promised(but ofc doesnt) pay the family of killed troops.
even so, a 100k HIMARS missile for 20 vatniks vs a 5k or less drone for an individual... hell, iv heard of suicide drones potentially being 1k or less if the explosives are avaliable... basically a body for a mortar shell.
so use both, have the loitering drone watch the 'single use drone' impacts, and drop its grenades where needed after + command now knows exactly what damage was done.
i think the difference is the grenade droppers are larger quad copters hovering in place while the suicide drones are more a model airplane coming in fast and boom.
smaller faster targets.
then again, its all speculation on my part, im no drone expert.
but switchblade style drones are far more difficult to defend against in their terminal stage.
i saw a vid early on of a Ukrainian drone operator with a chinese drone.
they dropped it in the middle of a field, started it n fuckin legged it cause aparently china had given russia access to its drone tracking data... either way.
drone did its thing, lands in field again, they pick it up.
4 hours later arty strike on that field... cause ofc, russia is top down only and it takes forever for info to go up n commands to come down.
the truely grizly part is... how much did the west spend on defeating the USSR... now there is one holdout.. Russia.. if we collectively, hell even if the US alone just dumped 20Bil to destroy russia and prevent it from putting another orange agent in the oval office, thats a fucking bargain?
ofc the EU wants its cut of meat, ignore Scholty, hes gonna get overruled or replaced soon enough, now that our stiletto wearing defence minister no longer needs special aid to go see the tanks....
im sure with the calculations, we will not just pay the 20k per soldier, but also send Ukraine 10 per kill for rebuilding, and then some and the west will have struck the bargain of a century.
all our shit was aimed at the USSR, now holdout russia... finally our mothballed shit can kick the rotten teeth out of that last holdout.
Release the Leopard, Releade the fucking 3k Bradleys in storage, Release the Marders, the Centurions, the F16s and Tornados.
On an offensive, if plenty of these drones are over the battlefield, that will make the enemy keep their heads down and not use their weapons.
something tells me the price per unit will relatively increase in the long run.
unit price stays the same, value of vatnik decreases.
unless we streamline production to keep up with falling vatnik value.
edit: with not worth it i meant purely the economic price per dead going up relatively.
ofc dead vatniks are worth our arms shipments until Ukraine is free.
if u gotta hover to drop ur warhead, ur vulnerable.
if u can go all speed ahead right into the enemy ur chances are better.
it was all made for this.
let it fight and die in this(IFV, MBTs etc we send WILL get killed, en masse, ofc.
less than them but it will happen.
this is no Iraq turkeyshoot, but it is still nicely 1 sided with our shit!
).
Doesn't surprise me, that drone swarm on crimea had a purpose, even if all drones were intercepted.
They should develop a cheap decoy version that gets mixed in with the armed versions, to the Russian AA missile, it's all the same.
now, were not talking taking expensive quad copters and crashing them, this is literally wings and a propeller for a mortar round.
I'd bet that future counter offensives would make wide use of these swarms to saturate an air defense (exhaust their supply) and/or unmask radar for fighters to hit them with HARM.
