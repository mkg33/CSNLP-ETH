Violence against women - Most violent crime s(sexual crimes are included within them) are committed against men by a significant margin, studies even show that men are less likely to report crimes committed against them than women do so the gap might be even larger here.
Allocating more resources to protect the demographics that is least likely to experience crime is irrational and discriminatory.
I know what you think, men are also the ones most likely to commit crime, with that said the solution is not to allocate more resources to protect women (as men are significantly more likely to face crime) but to invest in programs that help the extremely small minority of violent and aggressive men who commit crimes or are likely to commit crimes, this would help both men and women and it's not something that Gender Equality ministry does or wants to do.
I think this is the most discriminatory thing the ministry does, focusing on crimes committed against the demographics that faces significantly less crime is just illogical.
Building a ministry called "Prevention and Recovery for Aggressive Young Males" would be less discriminatory.
Giving free therapy to young males who exhibit aggressive behaviors in school - before waiting for violent acts - would do much more for men's and women's safety.
Such a program would be extremely expensive as lots of kids display aggressive behaviors without being violent but it would do so much for any country, still it would be particularly feasable in a coutry that can afford a Gender Equality ministry.
Yes, Korea is already the country with the lowest crime rate and murder rate in the world (probably only Singapore fares better) but this doesn't mean they can't do more, less violence agains both men and women is always better.
Uh... Culture shock I suppose but no way in hell would I want my female coworkers to be tasked with cleaning my dirty garments.
I guess I'm a chaotic good slob, I rather they just stay dirty.
