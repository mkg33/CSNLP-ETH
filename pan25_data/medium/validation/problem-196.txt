The Jewish Temples stood for a collective 800+ years on this spot.
This was the 1 holiest place in Judaism.
Both were destroyed by conquering armies.
The Al Aqsa mosque was built on the site.
For a VERY long time, predating the creation of modern Israel, there have been rumors circulated among the Arab locals that Jews are trying to take over and/or destroy the Al Aqsa mosque.
This rumor started the Hebron Riots in 1929, in which dozens of Jews were killed and Jews essentially kicked out of Hebron, and it started at least one of the Intifadas.
Israel actually heavily debated whether or not they would capture the Old City at all during the 6 day war, because of the religious importance it held for Muslims and Christians and the potential backlash they would get because of that.
But every once in a while, Jews go to visit the holiest site in their religion, and it becomes a huge deal.
If a politician does it "they are trying to take over Al Aqsa and destroy our 3rd holiest site".
It's absurd.
It is and always has been nonsense.
If the Israelis had any intention of destroying the Al Aqsa mosque, they would have done it in 1967 when they captured East Jerusalem including the Old City.
It was actually suggested at the time of the capture by a rabbi traveling with the army when they entered, but it was immediately shot down.
What this really boils down to is the fact that Jordan is allowed to implement bigoted, anti-Semitic policies on the Temple Mount without any consequences.
Why is it ok for them to be bigots?
It's so incredibly insane that bigotry by Arab nations is tolerated by the rest of the world.
They only get away with it because they have oil.
We need to stop consuming so much oil so those evil, anti-Semitic regimes can fuck off and get overthrown.
Who tf is criticizing a Jew in Israel for visiting Al Aqsa?
Itâ€™s literally a two minute walk up a ramp from the Western Wall in the middle of godsdamned Jerusalem (the capital city of that state) on the same spot the old temple stood during Roman times.
A bunch of anti-Semitic bigots who implement apartheid policies to exlude Jews from the Temple Mount.
The Jordanian Wakf understands geography just fine, they're just a bunch of anti-Semitic bigots looking for an excuse to incite violence against Jews.
Jordan is an apartheid state that enforces apartheid on the Temple Mount.
In fact, all Arab states are apartheid states.
They all discriminate against non-Muslims, women and LGBT people.
It's insane that people are outraged at a Jew trying to pray in the holiest site in Judaism.
The criticism should be directed at Jordan for implementing bigoted apartheid policies on the Temple Mount, which is holy to many religions other than Islam.
The world should stop tolerating bigotry and apartheid from Arab nations.
It's time for a boycott of Arab oil.
Those tyrannical regimes are just as bad as Russia.
