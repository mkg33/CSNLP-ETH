So yeah, if you actually care about America and don‚Äôt want to see it fall into fascism (as Republican policies are clearly trying to do,) then voting Democratic is indeed the only choice.
That doesn‚Äôt make Democrats perfect, but JHFC at least they‚Äôre not insane and are actually doing some good for this country instead of constantly trying to tear it apart.
The Democratic Party has gotten more progressive since the days of Bill Clinton.
That‚Äôs a good thing.
Meanwhile, the Republican Party has become more extremist and downright stupid.
Republican policies and rhetoric are centered around hurting people while only helping the rich and corporations.
The Republican party is an umbrella party that covers the gamut of policies so clear messaging and support of reasonable people is, in some instances, inevitable.
Remember that Republicans spent years demonizing it, making lawsuits to end it and telling the American people they would kill it and "replace" it with something else.
Remember "Death Panels?"
They were lying about replacement - and when they had the chance, they learned (as did the American people) that the program was actually very popular.
I do feel like Bernie has shifted the Dems slightly more left.
Which is a good thing but that maybe came 8 years too late.
The Dems had one window of opportunity during Obama's first term when he had the Congress and 60 Senate seats for 4 months.
They should have passed Universal Healthcare and a whole host of progressive legislation that was popular at the time and still is.
But sadly we got Obamacare a modest improvement on the healthcare system and not much else.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Sounds about right.
Btw, the only Republican I could think of that fit my little sarcastic remark was Ben Carson, but it‚Äôs not like I know every Republican candidate in the US over the past 4 years 6 years so‚Ä¶.
I don‚Äôt think of Obamacare as bad but Obama campaigned against Hillary in the primary as opposing universal healthcare.
So his intention was always Obamacare which was better than nothing but still a half measure.
But you mentioned Obamacare.
Don't forget that people like Joseph Lieberman torpedoed the Public Option.
But again, why blame only Democrats for that when the ENTIRE REPUBLICAN caucus was also against it?
Why are Republicans let off the hook for that?
Wait, I didn‚Äôt even know that was a thing.
You can just write /s instead of awkwardly saying ‚Äúbtw, this is sarcasm‚Äù.
I‚Äôm not being sarcastic here, I did not know about /S.
Modest or not, it made a BIG difference in many people's lives.
Should Obama have dropped the whole thing because he couldn't get Universal?
In politics, sometimes you have to push for what you can GET, and it will almost never be perfect.
And while the elites toil in endless debates over policy, people are hurting.
Most Democratic politicians seem to understand this now.
Republicans don't seem to care at all.
Well, the way the sausage gets made, it may have been stupid to push for a bill that had no chance of passing.
That could be more politically damaging the passing the "half measure," right?
You also have to remember that Obama was the first black President of the US and he had to tread carefully.
It sucked, but that was also a political reality.
Remember: He reached across the aisle to Republicans HEAVILY in the beginning (and yes, it was quite annoying to many Dems).
It‚Äôs not like Obama tried Universal Healthcare and settled for Obamacare.
The Dems in 2009 were much more in the mold of the Clinton triangulation model and there wasn‚Äôt much of a progressive caucus.
I think if that situation happened now Bernie would have torpedoed the thing if at worst there wasn‚Äôt a public option.
Republicans stabbed him in the back repeatedly and held that "coat room caucus" where they vowed to not let Obama get anything passed.
I'm curious why you say Bernie "would have torpedoed..." I mean, he WAS a sitting Senator back when all of this was happening.
Why didn't it torpedo it then?

What‚Äôs funny is that you find the truth to be amazing.
Perhaps you should stop allowing yourself to be lied to.
BTW, being a "free thinker" doesn't require everyone to disagree with you.
Sometimes a truth is self-evident, no?
Did you actually read the OPINION Washinon Times (a conservative media company) article you posted?
No?
Let me help you out with the very last sentence:
You're clearly not as informed as you pretend.
Republicans have already said they're going to stop J6 investigations and investigate the INVESTIGATORS (Jordan).
They plan on furthering their attacks on women's bodily autonomy by making it a FEDERAL issue (Graham).
They have pushed more and more egregious voting restrictions on citizens (there IS no voter fraud - they couldn't prove any in courts of law), and quite a few Republicans have pushed to have electors overturn voting results if they don't like the outcome.
‚ÄùIndoctrinated.‚Äù üôÑ You don‚Äôt see Liberals buying MAGA merch in droves or engaging in insurrections to appease their cult leader.
And you call them conspiracy "theories?"
They are indeed conspiracies, but they're doing it in the open.
SO the question is, how is it that you don't know it?
I don‚Äôt care how it was 30 years ago.
RIGHT NOW, the difference between Democrats and Republicans is night and day.
Anyone who doesn‚Äôt understand this is deluding themselves and/or part of the problem.
I'm sorry, but this is the definition of insanity.
Why?
WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING.
The problem is that WE'RE not being listened to.
Ask yourself: Why is it always asked that Liberals must listen to the "concerns" of the Right, but never the other way around?
How are you supposed to "listen" to people whose policies are specifically made to HURT you (anti-LGBT, voter suppression, unfettered gun laws, etc.
)?
Honestly, I keep seeing people making this obtuse comment on this thread, when it's CLEARLY not saying that.
I've been in this political swamp for enough time now, and through all of my listening to conservatives, I've seen the following basic truth: They don't actually believe the bullshit they say.
They use their rhetoric to gain influence and power from the division it causes.
That's how they can call themselves moral, family-oriented, "pro-life" people, then push to elect immoral, grifter, multiple-married adulterers who get their mistresses to have abortions, while denying basic healthcare to CHILDREN.
And do this against Democrats with lasting marriages, who happen to also be Christian, have their kids within their marriages, and push to pass laws that help EVERYONE - including those who don't support them.
The days of the "reaching out to the other side" bullshit is over until Republicans learn to do it in kind.
And where Democrats have failed in legislation, it's almost always because they're trying to make it bipartisan.
But Republicans, by their own mandate, make it a point to NEVER vote for anything a Democrat offers.
Yet, will still promote the law to their constituents later.
This country cannot get better until it addresses the clear problem holding us back: The current Republican Party.
I would LOVE to have a responsible conservative opposition party, to have an intellectual battle of ideas and bring together the best ideas from "both sides," but that isn't a reality right now when the Republican Party's standard-bearers are people like Donald Trump, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Jim Jordan.
