When you enter office with majorities in both houses, including a supermajority in the Senate, and you don't seize the opportunity to pass all the bills, you are a failure of such a tremendous magnitude and deserve literally all the blame.
And still, you're blaming them for not taking action on something that was precedent for 40 years at that time.
It was literally law.
Not codified, but still law because legal precedent is law in our legal system.
Please explain how.
From when Roe was ruled to when it was overturned there were 9 Presidents and 24 sessions of Congress (and many, many, different individual members of Congress).
Why was it singularly Obama's fault?
Why are the many states, many governors and state legislatures, many members of Congress, and SCOTUS, who were all actually opposed to abortion, all absolved in their part in overturning Roe?
Instead, they chose to fight for the ACA, something which had no equal in existing law.
It was a topic that was way less polarizing that abortion and even then they barely passed it.
That's a cop out.
First off, the president leads the party.
Fair or not, the buck stops with him.
It was his responsibility to get congress to take action.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Second, the Republicans don't act in good faith and never have.
They were never going to respect decades of settled case law, because they view the Supreme Court as a political body that makes law.
Leftists have been warning liberals to pull your heads out of your butts and see Republicans for what they really are.
They are the enemy.
Do not view them as human beings, they don't deserve it.
Stop defending Obama, literally one of the worst presidents in American history, and start trying to fix his mistakes.
We don't have much time.
We're just going to overlook all the presidents who failed to pass any health care reform at all?
Act like it wasn't considered impossible?
Or the fact that he was the first pro-LGBTQ president, even if it took him a while to catch up with reality?
Because he even supported the T, which was way more than anyone was expecting.
When a charismatic moderate like Obama gets on board?
The Overton window shifts.
As far as rights go, there's no such thing as rights, they're a made up concept.
What to the slave were rights?
What to the Japanese-Americans thrown in internment camps were rights?
What to the Native Americans were or are rights?
What to undocumented immigrants throughout history are rights?
They're a made up concept that this country has never once in its history respected.
