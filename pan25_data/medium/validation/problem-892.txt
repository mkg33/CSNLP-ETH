A ship that was called a “carrier killer” because of its supposed might.
Well,it’s a mighty impressive reef now.
Not a coral reef for sure but the advantages of reefs include providing shelter for fish etc.
As "lifeless" as you suggest, there are fish in the Black Sea.
There's a commercial industry (although too aggressive, they have to shift to conservation it looks like).
Then why is there a commercial industry?
Turkey catches hundreds of thousands of tonnes of fish alone a year for instance.
Or what about the tens of thousands of dolphins (sadly being killed by Russia).
Your point I guess is they only catch below a certain depth?
It's not that I don't believe you, its just I feel you are exaggerating the effects a bit.
Do you have any source reading for my curiousity?
I can't find anything corroborating your point.
BTW this article is not mentioning what you hoped it would.
I know you were referring to this instead:
But your point is still exaggerated because that only happens in some spots, not the entire black sea.
Edit: I should add: the largest "natural" dead zone.
With all our modern pollution, it wouldn't surprise me if we've created larger dead zones in the last 50 years, but those are not sustained naturally, so they won't preserve wrecks for thousands of years (hopefully).
