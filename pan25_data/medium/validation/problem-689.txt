Here’s my interpretation (not a lawyer, just an American trying to stay informed) of what’s in the bill:
(b) Damages for defamation are based on material published through the Internet, venue is proper in any county in the state.
…libel, slander, false light, invasion of 56 privacy, or any other tort founded upon any single publication, exhibition, or utterance, such as any one edition of a newspaper, book, or magazine, any one presentation to an audience, any one broadcast over radio or television, any one exhibition of a motion picture, or any one publication, exhibition, or utterance on the Internet.
Part 2: Giving legal protection to discrimination as long as someone claims it is due to a religion (If only a religion could sue for defamation…).
(2) An allegation that the plaintiff has discriminated against another person or group because of their race, sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity constitutes defamation per se.
(a) A defendant cannot prove the truth of an allegation of discrimination with respect to sexual orientation or gender identity by citing a plaintiff's constitutionally protected religious expression or beliefs.
Part 3: Protecting dehumanization hiding behind junky science (Imagine if it was illegal to speak against Eugenics justifications to uphold the Holocaust, Jim Crow laws, slavery, etc.
).
Section 12.
If any provision of this act or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of this act which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this act are severable.
(b) A defendant cannot prove the truth of an allegation of discrimination with respect to sexual orientation or gender identity by citing a plaintiff's scientific beliefs.
Part 4: If you call someone “religious” in Florida prejudiced, racist, misogynistic, homophobic, transphobic, or more, and the person sues you claiming their religion is why they hold discriminatory beliefs, you will owe a MINIMUM of $35,000 under Florida state law and its jurisdiction (This excludes paying the person suing for their attorney too).
(c) A prevailing plaintiff for allegations under this subsection is, in addition to all other damages, entitled to statutory damages of at least $35,000.
Part 6: Even if some of this specific bill is deemed ILLEGAL, only that PART will be taken out, and people must sue away the rest to make further changes.

Ron DeSantis loves sticking things up his ass.
NTTAWWT, but he really, really loves it.
I understand that when he visits somewhere they have to remove any object that could possibly be inserted into his anus because he just can't control himself, it's a compulsion.
He often has to have them surgically removed because he inserts them so far up his own ass.
It's well known around Tallahassee, that's why he has trouble hiring personal aides.
He usually asks them to help insert and remove various objects.
At times he's inserted light bulbs, turkey basters, baseballs, snow globes, lava lamps, fruits, canned vegetables, frozen beef tenderloins, smaller musical instruments, dumbbell weights, beer bottles, liquor bottles, socket wrenches, shoes, dog chew toys, magic 8 balls, lobsters, brake linings, bicycle seats, rolling pins, travel irons, collapsible umbrellas, flashlights, spray paint cans, and bocce balls.
The only thing he won't stick up his ass is dildoes "because they're gay".
Jim Crow laws ended against the state’s will with the passing of the civil rights act in 1967.
All but one representative in Florida voted against passing the civil rights act.
