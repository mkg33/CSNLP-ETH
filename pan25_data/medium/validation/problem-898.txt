I don't know how others here feel but I think it is hard to overstate the damage done to families by the anti-vaccine movement during the pandemic.
And I don't mean just from deaths of relatives who bought into the anti-vaccine narrative which of course is beyond sad and such an enormous sense of finality that can't ever bring them back.
But I am also talking about those in our families who bought into it, did not die, and behaved so selfishly and terribly to the point that the strain or break in the quality of that relationship itself being forever fractured or seemingly unable to be fully healed due to all that happened during that time.
There's a sense of finality there too, I think, that I don't see discussed too often.
That's a part of the legacy of groups like this as well.
