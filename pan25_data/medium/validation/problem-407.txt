Typically, you need a majority of the majority caucus to support a motion in order to put it on the floor to be voted on.
That would be 112 Republicans.

It's why him being voted in doesn't matter.
Once the first even remotely controversial bill comes up for a vote, like even just normal government funding, McCarthy will not have enough support to appease the crazies.
His speakship is dead on arrival even if he is voted in.
Boebert just said that McCarthy gave in on the single member motion to vacate.
This is where Boehner was smart enough to realize he was done and Ryan was smart enough to refuse to allow if he was going to take the job, because a Speakership where one person can force a vote to vacate isn't a Speakership at all.
Some Republicans want to lower that threshold to 1, which means just one Republican could instigate a vote on whether to vacate the Speakership at any time.
His desperation for it should really give people pause.
Why is he so beyond desperate for this position?
I get he's always wanted it, but with this much appeasement?
Boehner was threatened with this by a sizeable amount of Tea Party reps who were willing to sabotage legislation over it, and resigned rather than be forced to accept it.
Ryan refused to consider the Speaker job if this kind of thing was on the table.
