Well yes and no.
In a Nazi mind, the governments after 1945 are just a continuation of 1919-1933: They say both are products of Jewish conspiracy, the first Republic as a result of German and Bolshevik Jews stabbing Germany in the back (Dolchstoßlegende), and the Republics after the war as a result of American and Bolshevik Jews.
Thus, the Nazi government is considered the attempt of Germans trying to "get their country back".
I'm just back home in Scotland from a week in Germany, and the friends I was visiting were clutching their heads over this plot, because the plotters seemed to want to revive the Second Reich, never mind the Third ... it's no surprise the SovCit nonsense was name-checked or that there were AfD connections, but the politics of it is absolutely deranged!
The main reason they are called Reichsbuerger is not in reference to Imperial Germany, but to Nazi Germany: they say the capitulation that was accepted by the allied forces was not legitimate, because it was not penned by Hitler/Dönitz, but by the Wehrmacht - which is correctly stated, not the government and also in no way the sovereign.
For that reason they say that the Nazi state still exists in law (which is wrong, because full sovereignity has been given to Germany in 1990 after the reunification).
