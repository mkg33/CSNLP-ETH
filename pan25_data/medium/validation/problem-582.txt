Nobody from the GQP gives a fuck about governing, it’s only about power, forced births, billionaires and owning the libs, and as we just saw, it’s largely a losing platform.
It's a shame the most dramatic race has to be Arizona.
Kari Lake has already been election denying all week.
Now she's using the time frame it takes to count votes,to say Arizona has Democratic cheaters at their voting sites.
It's wild to see someone make such bold claims about election fraud like this.
Personally I hope someone finds a way to sue her because she's hurting democracy by questioning every single thing about her election.
