I understand the problem of Russian as the colonizer language.
I understand preserving Ukrainian and Ukrainian language.
I know how language can be a weapon, and how it can be used to divide.
And I also know that in free nations everyone must be a first-class citizen, whether they speak the main language as their first language or not; Russian speaking Ukrainians need to feel they are heard too if they are not to side with the invaders.
They must feel that their children and their culture have a place in Ukraine despite the divisions that war has brought.
Probably got changed; that is about Napoleon turning his army into ice cubes marching on moscow and then Russia joining in with prussia, England, and Austria to kick napoleon to corsica.
All of that work through his stooge to discredit America/NATO, and he triggers the first morally unambiguous war the US has been involved with in nearly a century.
Loses all of that hard work in a few months.
And makes himself an international laughing stock.
