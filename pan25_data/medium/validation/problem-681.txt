Jordan even keeps secret how many Palestinians & descendants were counted in its national census, as those have most likely grown into a large majority by Jordan's own definition.
It’s the US position too actually, it’s just a purely theoretical position for almost everyone involved.
The fact is the ‘67 borders are dead.
I’m not actually sure that a real as opposed to a purely symbolic UN resolution would get that much support.
Do people in this thread know that this has always been the China's position and there's nothing new here?
The same borders which did not include an independent Palestine, yes, kind of.
Those were the ceasefire lines from the war, not the designated boundaries from the 1940s.
It's complicated.
Gaza and the West Bank were a part of Egypt and Jordan, respectively.
(Jordan as separate from the WB is a complicated notion anyway, only with the loss in the late 60s did national differences start to really crystalize, prior to that it was more fluid, based on kindred or political class.
).
It's a non issue.
Egypt and Jordan disavowed their claim to the land.
The issue is having the correct understanding of the political borders pre-1967.
