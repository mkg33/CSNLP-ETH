They are also insanely useful in manufacturing and chemical engineering.
In addition to low friction, they're very resistant to chemicals and heat.
They're easy to clean of bacterial films.
Eliminating them instantly would be a catastrophic hit to modern medicine.
Pharmaceutical manufacturing systems and medical devices rely on equipment that is highly regulated, and replacement parts have to go through intensive testing.
In all probability, a smaller company with different waste handling and liability will pick up these industries.
That's probably necessary as an intermediate step.
But in many situations, the new company's product has to go through a certification process, even though they're making (or trying to make) the same thing that 3M was.
In 1955 they figured out it bound to blood, so theyâ€™ve already had 67 years to look for a replacement.
And in Antwerp they were caught polluting with pfas for decades and had the audacity to play innocent and deny everything and spin bs and lies just this year.
Fuck 3M.
