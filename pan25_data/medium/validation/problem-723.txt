I read a fantastic article maybe a decade ago about 9/11's effects on police in the US.
Basically every police force in America used it as an excuse to get military equipment in case Al-Qaeda wanted to attack the local Walmart.
There was a town that was given a giant vehicle capable of rescuing people from high rise buildings, despite the town not having a single building over 2 stories.
Another town was given a bunch of equipment that was later only ever used for the local lawnmower races, hosted by the police department.
