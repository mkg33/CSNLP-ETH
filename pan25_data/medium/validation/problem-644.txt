It's frustrating because nobody should be hanging on the (alleged) words said by some itinerant apocalyptic rabbi from two millennia ago.
If he made some good points, that's great, but they should be worthwhile regardless of who said them.
Take Socrates for example: the only reason he stands as a giant in the field of philosophy is that many of his arguments have stood the test of time.
If someone besides Socrates had made them (and to be honest, we don't even know if he was a real man), they would be just as good.
The teachings of Jesus largely just use his authority as the reason they should be taken seriously.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
