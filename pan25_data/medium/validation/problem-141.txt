The US will do whatever makes russia or China weaker, that’s the thing about rivals they don’t want the others to get ahead.
It’s obvious that China if they do would try to get a fair deal in Russian eyes which if the US is brokering would do the same for Ukraine.
tbh, the only way they could broker a peace is to pressure Russia to do it.
China has leverage over Russia; they have practically nothing against Ukraine except for threats like sending arms to Russia.
Since China hasn't done that yet, I don't see that changing unless something else also changes.
100% agree with your viewpoint.
They will try to set up terms where Donbas is conceded to Russia and create a North Korea/South Korea like stalemate where both sides will throw artillery every few months and blame the other.
Although I wish it were, sadly that is not the case…China imports a paltry $7bln (which could be replaced by Russia,ex-Soviet or African country) from Ukraine which is 15% of Ukraines imports whereas Ukraines imports amount to a rounding error in terms of China’s total imports of $1.5T.
Additionally, China does not import any meaningful amount of wheat from Ukraine (Dec 2022 saw 75% decrease in Barley imports from Ukraine) and the largest import is actually iron ore and seed oils - which are fairly easily replaceable.
You may be right but any commander or leader needs to know when enough is enough look at Germany durying ww1 they could have kept fighting but a lot of supply’s and manpower were expended, They didn’t want to kill all the men in there country.
That should be a lesson to world leaders that even if a country surrenders you should still give them a fair deal.
So if Ukraine’s about to lose we should send nato soldiers in?
That’s absurd and would start a global conflict I would suspect China would come to Russia’s aid.
It wouldn’t be 3 days to the Russian border or even Moscow and come at large costs to manpower.
Idk where your from but is your country willing to put blood on the table.
Are you willing to put your blood up there?
