Russia is the largest exporter of all three: ammonia and urea (nitrogen), processed phosphate (phosphorus), and potash (potassium).
Other countries do have these, but it is usually more cost-effective to get it all from Russia.
To further complicate matters, China (another major producer of fertilizer components) has ceased exports to shore up their domestic supply, and Belarus is another potash supplier.
Canada, Morocco, and Saudi Arabia also supply some fertilizer components, but in the short term they can't really expand production because that often involves opening new mines, which can take years to become operational.
I really can't see Russia ever giving up any part of Ukraine unless forced out, and Russia will only agree to a ceasefire if they get the land they think is theirs.
That won't stop Russia though - it ultimately wants ALL of Ukraine.
True, but russia also uses ceasefire as time off to regroup, prepare/make weapons, mobilise and train people to launch another attack breaking all previous agreements.
So having a ceasefire with russia isn't really an option.
