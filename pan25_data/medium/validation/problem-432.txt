Russia and Azerbaijan are working in tandem here to get Zangezur from Armenia.
Which will basically neuter Armenia completely.
Well, because it's not trendy enough for the prominent western articles to cover anything related Armenia or humanitarian crisis that involves Azerbaijan.
Only local news and regional and specialised news cover it.
Not surprised you didn't find.
Not 120 000 though.
That's the inflated number to make them sound plausible.
In reality there are 25 to 30K people, half of which are the military personnel.
However Armenia's current government with founded and unfounded fears, is slow in telling Russia to fuck off, so EU and the US can do their thing more effectively.
Its always amazing to me whenever I see a person that has the ability and education to comprehend multiple languages and still chooses to wallow in wilful ignorance by gobbling state propoganda.
I am referring to the Facebook post of Armenian First Lady and you accuse me of state propaganda??
How brainwashed are you, that you consider everything that is opposed to your beliefs as a propaganda?
It showed 10-15K people including the children.
Check out the post of the wife of Armenian PM.
She has posted how children are being abused for propaganda.
