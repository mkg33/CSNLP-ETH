Well, it seems like they did ( tried anyway ) this time and aren't having much more of an issue than MA, for example.
I think it's a topic for news, not politics.
I've lived in Maryland, Colorado, and Michigan.
Surprise twist MD does not spend as much money when factoring for harsh winter weather as the other two states do,, and I would think they are crazy if they did.
Even with their ice storms I would not expect TX to spend as much ether, so even best case thryy will likely have problems.
There will undoubtedly be a lot of states making those sane tradeoffs as climate changes.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
