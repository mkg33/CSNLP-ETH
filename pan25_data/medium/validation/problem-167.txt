>On the campaign trail ahead of the midterm elections, Fetterman repeatedly vowed to support the end of the filibuster in the Senate if it would allow for key legislation to pass on gun control, labor protections, abortion rights, or voting access.
It should be clear that we don't even have to end the traditional filibuster, where a Senator takes to the floor in moving speech (or in Cruz's case doing something as meaningless as Dr. Seuss).
All that needs done is the removal of what I call the Lazy Filibuster: blocking a bill via the cloture vote that requires a 60-vote threshold.
This is a fairly recent tactic chiefly employed by Republicans to rule from the minority.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
The traditional filibuster is rarely a problem and a useful tool.
Senators are rare to use it unless they have an impassioned reason for it and usually it means old men have to stand for prolonged periods and actually work.
It also puts them in the spotlight as being the reason progress isn't occurring, so it better be for a good reason.
Edit: For those unaware the cloture vote is just a vote to bring the bill to the floor for debate and discussion, not even to vote on the bill itself.
It signals that Republicans don't even want to open a dialogue.
I always try to remember that the filibuster started as a side effect of a senate rule being removed by the guy who killed Alexander Hamilton.
Senate used to have the same simple majority rule for cloture as the House, but Burr thought the Senate was to cultures to need a rule about ending debate.
He was absolutely wrong, and slavers figured out that they could infinitely stall bills that helped the enslaved since there is a limit on how long the Senate is in session.
And ever since then, the filibuster has mainly been a tool used against black people, no matter how much it changed and became codified.
It is pretty wild history to learn about, and Chris Hayes from MSNBC interviewed a guy who wrote a book about how the filibuster has always been a cudgel used on black people.
SO MANY laws had to be changed to include a “fuck black people” exception to get Dixiecrats on board with welfare reforms.
To my knowledge they can rotate (someone please correct me on this as I can't find any info or precedent).
Still, this would be a massive improvement than what is otherwise just the threat of a filibuster.
At the heart of much of our problems we face and the feeling of government not working for the people is this lazy filibuster.
Yeah but curiously we rarely if ever saw this in the past as far as I'm aware.
This may have to do with predefined time limits on bill debate and the filibuster is just the very last senator talking in a sort of overtime situation.
It's bad for government to have to compromise with the losing party full of very bad ideas.
That doesn't purify anything; it poisons the well.
Nah that won't happen.
Gun control laws are popular.
Watch GOP go bye-bye if they do.
Just like they claimed they'd repeal Obamacare lol.
Democrats know their ideas are popular.
If these things pass in their entirety and aren't watered-down to uselessness, then Americans will see for themselves.
Republicans are very afraid of that.
It's not just a voice, it's rule from the minority.
Passing a bill only takes a simple majority.
It's absurd that it takes 60 just to vote to discuss said bill.
