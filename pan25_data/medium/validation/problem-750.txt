Absolutely incredible....I have watched with amazement from when President Eisenhower signed the act forming NASA.
From Mercury to Gemini to Apollo, skylab, ISS, Shuttle, etc to this new Artemis program.
Never gets old.
Looking forward to the future missions.
And yet itâ€™s still shorter than some of the top end of the mission durations NASA plans to do in the next decade(s).
The first lunar orbit missions are 7-10 days.
the extended duration missions are expected to go over a month.
Orion improves upon Apollo ship, even though they look similar.
Better computers, more roomy, and probably better radiation protection.
Orion's heat shield is also lighter and just as strong as Apollo's.
Think of it as a Constitution vs Excelsior from Star Trek, or a Z-95 vs X-Wing from Star Wars.
Same idea and blueprint, just refinements.
Well Star Trek has self-sealing stem bolts.
Incidentally, I came into possession of a hundred gross of those bolts, only traded five thousand wrappages of Cardassian yamok sauce for them!
