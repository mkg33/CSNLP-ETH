Not a fan of Marcos but I’m glad that he’s taking a proactive role in this and undoing all of Duterte’s ass-kissing with China.
All of Southeast and East Asia needs to come together and unite against their common enemy; Winnie the Pooh and the CCP.
I feel like people think Duterte was pro China because of all the shit that he talked.
But the biggest act that showed me he wasn't was the continued presence of the US military in the Philippines.
Philippines remains an uninterrupted partner of US strategy in the region.
Because he realized there were never really positives with aligning with China and Russia after all.
China kept on bullying, threatening, pushing away fishermen, stealing small islands and fishing waters repeatedly.
What exactly was undone that made the Philippines China leaning?
The US military was never removed from the Philippines.
One can hardly be called a China leaning state while hosting the military of China's biggest geostrategic threat as a permanent feature.
While his visit in Russia proved futile too, no help from Putin especially when the Marawi just happened.
He went home empty handed.
