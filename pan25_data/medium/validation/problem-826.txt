The solution to Hamas is very likely the same as the solution to the IRA in Northern Ireland or what is going on with the various gangs in Columbia; amnesty in exchange for disarmament.
But if you think Ukraine just magically finding Israel anti air missiles, or Israel just randomly attacking Iranian drone factories is a coincidence, I have some cutting edge Russian tech to sell to you.
Worth noting: the Palestinians have long demanded full Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank as a precondition for a peace settlement.
It would be rather awkward for Israel to throw their full and open support behind the Ukrainian demand for a full Russian withdrawal as a precondition for such talks as well, wouldnâ€™t it?
Israel was historically in the same situation as Ukraine, and won their wars for self determination.
If the Arab nations didn't fight, there'd have been no war.
If Israel didn't fight, there'd be no Israel.
Yes, but very much under the hood.
And Zelenskyy knows it has to appear that Israel is not supportive of Ukraine, that is why he is making these critical statements.
