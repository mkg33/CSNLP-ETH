Israel has a right to exist, but the UN set up a permanent investigation for a reason.
Nationalism combined with outright discrimination.
10% identify as far right, 60% identify as right to far right.
16% out of the total 27%(want to fully annex the West Bank) of the population that was polled, want to annex and deny the Palestinians political rights.
Those people are serving in the IDF.
Those are the people shooting a child for throwing stones at them.
It should be condemned.
If you are using school for military purposes you are making it legal military target, in other words you are making living shields from your own children which is inhuman.
Wars and conflicts are shitty things created by adults which make Earth corrupted and rotten place but we shouldn't engage children in our problems whenever is possibile.
Condemn evil, violence and hatred wherever the source is, no more finger pointing or picking sides.
When Israel commits evil call it out, When Hamas does something shitty then call it out.
All enemies of peace should be shamed.
