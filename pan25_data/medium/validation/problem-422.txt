Well, places than need to be staffed 24/7 still can have 48 work weeks, they just need to have more staff for that.
Basically, long shifts and lots of week hours just mean the place is understaffed.
I work for a US based company that moved to 4x8s a bit over a year ago with no changes in benefits or salary.
Even our hourly employees are still paid for 40 hour weeks.
Absolutely life changing for me and itâ€™s hard to ever think of leaving my current employer because of it.
The point of the opportunity to move to a 48 work week from a company perspective is that the extra 8 is not being used.
Suggesting that a company can do it by just paying more money is equivalent to saying they can't do it within the context of what is being discussed.
a 24/7 company is using the full 40 hour work week by having each employee be available for the full 40 hours each week.
Arguing for the ability to move to a 48 work week is because it will have little to no effect on the company's ability to function or it's finances, while being advantageous for the employee.
You've missed the point if you're arguing that a 24/7 company can do it still if they just hire more people.
