Also, the Julian calendar, why are we still doing this?
And the weird compromise that goofs everything up?
I mean come on.
I just want to say that it warms my heart to read so many orthodox folks come out of the woodwork on this one.
What other interesting ways has Ukraine been rejecting Russian influence?
I'm especially interested in changes that an outsider might not even think of.
The article got it a bit backwards: 7 January Gregorian is 25 December Julian, so the Orthodox church is more correct in this.
Thus, if a person's birthday, who was born before 1917 in Russia, when the Julian calendar was still used, was, say, 25 August, then after switching to Gregorian it would be celebrated on 7 September (25 August Gregorian here would just be an irrelevant date).
Besides, if the Ukrainian church wants to move Christmas on 25 December, they will have to move all other dates of all festivities as well (19 Jan -> 6 Jan, etc).
The compromise was that fixed feasts (Christmas for example) would be celebrated per the Revised Gregorian calendar whereas moveable feasts (Pascha, aka Easter) would be dated per the Julian calendar.
There was a proposal to adjust the movable feasts back in 1923 but it was rejected.
Because of course.
