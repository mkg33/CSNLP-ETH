They need something to show for the entire Eastern theater of the war since Lysychansk 5 months ago.
Especially since all the withdrawals from Kharkiv, Kherson, and (possibly upcoming) ZNPP have made Russians forget even those few victories, and the public opinion is gradually changing to "Russia is losing."
Putin needs a recent win to have any chance of ending the war on non-disastrous terms for Russia and himself personally.
Not saying Putin would manage to accomplish that (Ukraine has a good chance of pushing Russia out of the entire Kherson and Zap oblasts, all the way to the Crimean border), but these I think are the current plans.
Bakhmut isn't even that strategically important for Russia anymore.
It was in integral city for Russia to control before the Lyman counteroffensive because it kept Russia from advancing toward Sloviansk from the south.
Once Russia lost the areas around Lyman, Bakhmut should have been relegated to a second tier front but instead they doubled down, throwing wave after wave of infantry at an area of the front that has probably as many lines of defense as the static area along the Donetsk border.
Perhaps it's a case of having lost so much in their attacks that they can't stop now or else it would all have been for nothing.
