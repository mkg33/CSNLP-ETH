Let's take a gasp to remember the political prisoners who called this a war earlier this year could face up to 15 years in prison.
But that's the cost of the "strong" authority and "masculine" leader that they want, I suppose; with a trail of ruined families left in their path.
I love those “strong” and “masculine” leaders, that are so “strong” and “masculine” they cannot handle any criticism or dissenting opinion.
Insecure, narcissistic pieces of shit, who got into power by scheming and lying to everyone including themselves.
And then you have deluded people buying into this nonsense and thinking that this is what good leadership looks like.
Truly strong leadership is born from constructive conflict, from the clash of ideas and from being able to jointly arrive at either the objective truth or an equitable compromise.
It means being able to convince others - not through threats but through a change of heart.
Silencing critics and censoring opposing opinions is nothing more than pathetic cowardice.
Russia has a history of detecting a potential social issue in the US (let's use BLM as an example), create support groups AND backlash groups disguised as Western instead of Russian, then fan the flames hard and making it look like there's more bitter hatred than there actually is (which eventually becomes reality).
