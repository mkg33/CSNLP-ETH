No, they didnt.
Because we dont know how Biden came into possession of those documents yet.
We know how Trump got the documents he had.
He took them despite NARA saying "hey, return those".
He stalled, made excuses, gave halfassed appeasements behind blatent lies and intentionally withheld documents.
At surface level based on what we know so far, one appears negligent at worst, the other is blatantly malicious.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
This is what is wrong with America, today.
Binary thinking is killing the nation.
People who disagree with you are not, by default, your enemy, or evil.
Specific people may be, but broad brushing like this is harmful (to both sides).
\[Biden shouldn't be impeached for the documents.
He should be impeached for refusing to enforce the law on the southern border (dereliction of duty), putting America at risk.
Effectively, he's single-handedly destroying the country.
We cannot absorb millions of poor, unassimilated migrants.
It is creating chaos and financial problems in cities across the country.
It's increasing crime, and enabling a free flow of fentanyl that is killing record numbers of Americans (originating from China, sent through the border by the cartels).
And don't tell me that our enemies haven't snuck sleeper cells through the porous border.
Biden is enriching the cartels, harming Mexico, enabling enemies to attack us from within, while suing states that are trying to slow the flood of illegal crossings.
Love or hate Trump as you wish, but he had the border situation under control.
Then Biden took office...\].
If those were the only two picks, I'd pick Trump.
Biden struggles cognitively, completely screwed the pooch in Afghanistan, is slowly destroying this nation by allowing anyone into the country who can physically cross our southern border, and is attacking fossil fuels before we have anything capable of replacing them (bye-bye energy independence).
He's also the most divisive President I've seen in my lifetime.
He seems to hate half the country, and his Sith Lord speech was truly something to behold.
Trump sucked in some ways, but he actually did some good.
He secured the southern border (for the first time in modern history), facilitated peace treaties in the ME, and helped a stumbling economy start growing at a good pace.
Lowest unemployment rate for blacks and Hispanics (and women), as well (I provide this for the identity politics crowd, who are probably unaware of this fact).
Both worked with the DoJ to return documents (contrary to so much false news, Trump had returned boxes of documents upon request).
Trump did get a bit obstinate on some he felt he should be able to keep.
In the middle of negotiations, he was raided (another difference).
Maybe he deserved it, but it was unprecedented.
If you push emotions aside, and look at what each has done, it's a no-brainer.
I would like an option C, though, to be honest.
Of course they are different.
Trump had the power to declassify any document he wanted, Biden did not (at the time of taking them home).
Trump's team DID turn over a crapload of document, upon request.
The fight was over some he felt he should be able to keep (wrong move, IMO).
To say that he didn't cooperate is not true.
To say that Biden is cooperating more, is fair.
I'm glad Biden is forthcoming with the docs, but he's had them for years.
The FBI seems uninterested in searching, to make sure the Biden team is actually handing over all the docs (blind trust seems misplaced).
In addition, Hunter, who made millions from China, Russia, and Ukraine (among others) from selling access to the big guy, lived there for quite some time (with the documents).
