It's not the weapon manufacturers causing the deaths, it's Russia invading that's causing all the deaths.
Or, to put it another way: who was responsible for all the death and destruction of WW2?
Weapon manufacturers?
Or the countries that invaded other countries, then had to be beat back at gunpoint?
You think a lack of arms companies would keep a country hell-bent on destroying their neighbor from declaring war?
The ruzzians straight up deny the right to existence for Ukraine, and are waging a war of ethnic and cultural genocide.
Even if the ruzzians didn't have private companies, the central government would make the guns from smaller shops, or would even create their own defense department.
However, it's pretty clear, IMO, that a country having weapons doesn't automatically lead to a country invading its neighbors.
After all, most countries have fairly extensive arsenals but don't invade their neighbors with them.
It's sort of like people having guns: it doesn't automatically mean those people will try to kill other people, it just makes it much more possible for them to do so.
Some Russians are, some aren't.
The Russian population is much less behind this than the Germans were in WW2.
There's a reason there were street protests in Russia and hundreds of thousands of them fled: this is not a very popular war.
Popular, maybe, but not very popular.
You sound so incredibly naive over this.
Do you really think guns create demand for war, or do you think demand for war makes guns?
