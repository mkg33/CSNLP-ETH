I went to school and was good mates with one of the slain officers, he was such a good bloke and kind soul, this is bloody heartbreaking and i feel so horrible for his siblings and family he was a triplet and was meant to come home to brisbane for christmas yesterday, i cant believe his life was cut short in such a horrible dispicable and meaningless act of violence by these conspiracy theorist nutjobs, no one deserves to lose their life while just trying to do their job.
From one Aussie to another so incredibly sorry for your loss please know even though we don’t know them first hand the whole country is grieving with you….
