No, we haven’t experienced a dictatorship, but it was close to becoming that with trump, ( hence my remark).
Our democracy is failing and ppl who study the demise of democracies worldwide think it’s only 10-20 years away.
So.. maybe I’ll still be alive ?
( over 60 now).
I don’t wish this on anyone and have my whole life watched as nations lost their rights as dictators took over.
The US govt was responsible for over 100 democratically elected presidents to be ousted.
It’s a shameful legacy.
The South American countries really never recovered from our tampering ( begin under Eisenhower with the United fruit growers take over).
I’ve been so disappointed in humanity that we couldn’t do better than this.
I’m old.
We should’ve transitioned to democratic govts everywhere, a long time ago, not the other way around.
If my govt was part of your being controlled , I’m so sorry.
The common people are easily swayed by propaganda and so our votes are manipulated to be in their favor.
Remember it's never just a single person, while they may be the figureheads and immoral heart of their respective parties, ultimately it's convincing and getting a bunch of like minded authoritarians to follow your mandates.
