Its literally supply and demand in action.
As the population of workers drops relative to the number of jobs, then the cost of labor goes up, since each individual laborer has more options.
IF you flood the market with cheaper labor, you can create downward pressure on wages.
While its great to keep prices down and get more workers, it kind of screws the people who would otherwise take advantage of the tight labor market.
That might be true for some jobs but not others.
There is no pay shortage for software devs, for example, there is a genuine labor shortage.
We have 40 million unfilled developer positions in the US and there genuinely aren't enough trained professionals to fill them.
So the software dev field is a bit complicated here, but to generalize it, the more credentials or higher skill the job is the more insulated it is from market effects.
It's why the ice cream shop down the street is offering almost 80 percent more than it was 2 years ago but software devs are probably seeing something like a 10 to 20 percent increase (I'm speculating,) but that pressure still exists.
At some point there's a potential software dev that stays working IT, a potential IT guy who stays working doing computer repair, and a computer repair guy who stays working at the ice cream shop because of the upward pressure of the wages from the bottom, so it also creates a shortage at the top.
Notable too that the tech industry has been on absolute fire because of growth companies in the inflationary cycle, there's a reason big tech has been doing TONS of layoffs disproportionate to the market recently, and why the number of openings rose so quickly in the last 2 to 3 years (and it's not just remote work/covid.
).
