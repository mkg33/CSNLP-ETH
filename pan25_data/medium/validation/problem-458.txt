Exactly!
This is no place for Euphemisms, Russia is straight up commiting genocide.
it's also what Ottomans/Turks did when they enslaved Greece.
Kidnapped children and brainwashed them to be Genitsaroi, soldiers made to hunt down and fight their own kind.
They are stealing them to put towards their war effort.
Not to straight kill them, as in genocide, but in the end, it's basically the same.
Perhaps the UN can intervene for both articles of genocide and crimes against humanity.
Unfortunately the UN is useless thanks to the security council and its own lack of power.
They may wag their finger, but other then that the UN has no power or legitimacy look up what happened in Rowanda for context.
And what the New spanish did to Azteks with Cortes.Not to mention that even Great Alexander did the same in the oast and not just him.Infinite generals,politicians and more dod the same.
Either way, we agree that what Russia is doing is despicable and the fact that they are genocidal in more than one way makes the situation even more horrific.
The term Genocide has a very specific definition as determined by the United Nations.
