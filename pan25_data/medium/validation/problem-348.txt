I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.

They want the public school system to fail because it has laws about teaching children fairly and accurately.
They want a world where everything is private and free to teach kids the twisted ideals that they themselves believe.
This is the plan for everything: gnaw away at it then point out how useless it is and so everyone wants privatization.
Education, utilities, Medicare/NHS, Social Security, EVERYTHING.

Thank goodness for this guy.
I live in the same town, and my child is a high school student at another public school in the county.
I am a teacher in a private school in another town, but I'm thinking of ways to create a protest movement at my school.
