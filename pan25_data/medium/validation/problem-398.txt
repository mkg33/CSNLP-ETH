I work at a fund that trades emerging market sovereign debt including Ghana’s.
This has nothing to do with China or any other bilateral creditor.
If anything these bilateral loans are a massive lifeline because they’re typically very long dated and at below market rates.
Essentially Ghana has a revenue issue, along with other more developed SSA countries (Kenya comes to mind).
It consistently spent well above what it earned (including by spending way more than necessary during the pandemic) and filled the gaps by borrowing domestically in GHS denominated securities.
Local currency debt is way more expensive than dollar debt because of currency risk; the coupons on these bonds were typically 15-20%.
As a result their budget got consumed more and more by interest, 80% of which was on these domestic bonds.
Not only were these local bonds expensive, but they had short maturities, typically 1-3 years.
This meant the government had to roll over a huge amount of these bonds every year on top of the borrowing to fill their fiscal deficit.
Because their domestic market was essentially saturated, they started printing money to fill the gap.
Furthermore, because investors knew their fiscal situation was unsustainable (their spending on interest and government salaries alone outweighed total revenues last year) they knew more money printing would occur.
Because of this printing (and anticipated printing) the GHS collapsed against the dollar.
Foreign investors dumped their Eurobonds, local retail investors abandoned the GHS and bought hard currency instead.
As a result their foreign exchange reserves plummeted this year.
However, in normal circumstances I would argue their external position is sustainable as they run a trade surplus, get reasonable FDI volumes and are well integrated into international markets.
Tl;dr: this default was driven almost entirely by domestic debt, not external debt.
This isn’t a predatory lending situation.
This has nothing to do with China.
The photo on the article is misleading.
Yes that’s a good point.
IMF generally won’t give money in situations like this if they feel they’re bailing out private investors and/or China.
Also just to add, they are forcing the issue, as they want FCY creditors to take a haircut on what they owe as that is a condition without which IMF wont disburse the 3bn loan.
Another similar point: ignoring what you mentioned about the IMF relationship, they could probably get away with just restructuring their local debt or only lightly restructuring the external.
However politically that would be toxic; how could they punish domestic investors (including pension funds) and not foreign bankers?
In that vein however I imagine the terms they eventually settle on with Eurobond investors will be fairly relaxed.
What they’ve asked for so far is a non-starter.
Save your breath, man.
Everybody here just wants to jump to the part where they can say “CHINA BAD”.
