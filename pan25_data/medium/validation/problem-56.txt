This is anecdotal, but a few people I talked to were strongly against the war.
Some were beaten or threatened by the government but didnâ€™t consider leaving until the draft started.
Apparently some protesters get arrested and then sent straight to the war.
I understand it perfectly.
Before the war I used to visit my aunt in St. Petersburg.
I remember the stark change of scenery to run down, black and abandoned villagers once you crossed the border to russia, I remember the distinct smell of shit on train station and poor people in kommunalkas without hope for the future.
And when russia annexed crimea suddenly I became a part of that world.
But knowing how much of them wholeheartedly supported what was happening around them, the cult of putin and russian mythical greatness, untill it affectedly them personally - it's hard to feel compassion.
Oligarchs are probably still living pretty comfortably, if a tad nervous.
Until Putin decides he wants their assets and they accidentally fall out of a window, at least.
