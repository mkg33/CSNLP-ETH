It doesn't matter at all to them that many of the people representing them are fools or thieves.
It's better than the satanic Democrats who are trying to usher in literal demons.
They see the US as the promised land, and that God would never let the country fail as long as good Christians are in charge.
Therefore it doesn't matter that Beobert is useless.
She pisses off the right people and is a cheerleader for the faithful.
They truly believe that's all that's necessary.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
