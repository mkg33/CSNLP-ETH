India has invited participation for partnering on a next gen tank.
And Russia is one of the countries that has shown interest.
Su-57 was supposed to be a joint project.
Then it was hit with constant delays, dropping performance and capabilities, and a price that doubled.
T-90S program has also been ripped apart by the Indian army, being called a "absolutely terrible combat vehicle".
MiG-29K is despised by the Indian Navy.
It barely works, and when one failed, Russia effectively called the Indian Navy incompetent and unable to fly, vs just admit there was an issue with the aircraft.
MiG-29K wasn't even 7 years old before the Indian Navy launched a program to replace it, notably with Russian aircraft essentially being excluded (they bid, but were never even considered as a longshot option).
India has been grabbing as much as they can from the US, UK, France, and Israel, as they continue to cut their imports from Russia.
With India's opinion of the T-90 well known, and the T-90s, uh... Not good... Record in Ukraine, there's effectively a 0% chance they go with the Armata.
US' and France (and every other military for that matter), experience cost overruns, but nothing even remotely close to how completely fucked the Su-57 program was.
Kind of like the current dumpster fire that is the Turkish Atlay tank.
