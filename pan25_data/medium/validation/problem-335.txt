Perhaps an attack on Crimea from Ukraine?
I don't think Russia would waste what's left of their sea based armament on another useless missile attack.
Especially with those anti ship batteries now waiting in the shadows.
The juice simply isn't worth the squeeze for a Christmas day message.
It would be more likely that they would be used to shore up defenses on the peninsula and act to some degree as a shield for Russian forces/ emergency egress option.
It's been hours since a vessel above 10000 t has caught fire, we're definetly overdue.
It's really too bad Ukraine didn't get any major vessels post USSR they would be sitting ducks if Ukraine had a couple of fast well maintained destroyers.
The Russian navy can't go past 15 knots.
Some good old fashioned main gun duels.
Then again Russia has been gearing up for another run on kyiv.
It would be allot sooner than expected.
That being said, sinking one while it's servicing your only carrier of still pretty impressive, and the world will not Russia forget it...
