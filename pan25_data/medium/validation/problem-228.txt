Egypt is a military dictatorship and tourism is a strategically vital industry for the dictatorship.
The amount of people who travel to Egypt that end up with gastrointestinal issues needing antibiotic treatment for months to cure is also astonishingly high ...
They not only "drip feed" discoveries but also "rediscover" stuff frequently and hype up the narrative about it.
Also be perfectly aware of the fact that your legal rights as a individual tourist have little value compared to reputation of their country as a tourism destination meaning if you or your child gets raped ... "there is no way that happened as tourists are rarely victims of violent crime in Egypt" ...
Why anyone would travel to Egypt right now is beyond me.
I still remember the story from decades ago of a sausage maker in Cairo getting busted for using street dogs to make his sausages which he sold primarily to the high end hotels in Cairo...
And if you press the issue understand you are now a threat to a vital strategic economic activity of a military dictatorship... you are now a problem.
Ever since I heard about that journalist's public mass rape in Cairo's biggest square during the Arab spring celebration of independence, I've had a negative view.
Seeing travel YouTubers recently show how corrupt it is there made me vow to avoid ever going there tbh.
Not trying to bias anyone here but just speaking for myself.
