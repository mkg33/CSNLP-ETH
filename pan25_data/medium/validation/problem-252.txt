These feckless shitstains stood by Trump after an INSURRECTION and the theft of national security secrets, to say nothing of asking states to fabricate votes or killing millions of Americans by awfully botching the response to Covid.
This tells any reasonable person all they need to know: Republicans care solely about clawing onto power and give not an iota of care for the well-being of the nation or its people.
Look at these shameless idiots avowedly ditching Trump now that he caused the GOP one of the most hideously poor midterm performances in history.
