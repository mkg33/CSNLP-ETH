Foreign Minister Lavrov blamed Hitler's "Jewish ancestry" for the Holocaust, saying that the "greatest anti-Semites are often Jews."
This is the average mindset in Russian government.
Seems to me Russia is doing this on purpose so it muddies the water.
Even the average Russian would have realized their dictator needing to "liberate" people speaking their language sounds an awful lot like Hitlers reasons for starting wars.
Especially when the liberating looks like towns reduced to rubble.
One comment I liked on Reddit compared the West's impression of Nazism with Russia's.
In the West, Nazis are evil because of their actions in the Holocaust, with their military strenh and technology being grudgingly or overtly praised.
In Russia, Nazis are evil because they were a strong military power that attacked Russia, while the anti-Semitism and the Holocaust are relatively unimportant.
This difference explains the Russian "we are fighting Jewish Nazis" absurdity and their antisemitic statements: to them, it's completely possible for a Jewish president to be a leader of Nazis, since all Nazism means is having a strong military and being opposed to Russia.
