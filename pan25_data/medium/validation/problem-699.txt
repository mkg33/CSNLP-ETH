I was hoping someone to grab onto this.
Very hard to deny or just ignore.
Of course they can just do whatever and ignore it, but at least it looks really bad.
"After losing Kherson city, RF focused most of their efforts on capturing Bakhmut city.
From 11.11 - 22.12, they lost around 21.000 personnel and loads of equipment.
Despite their efforts at capturing the city, a garden snail in that period would have covered a greater distance.

I know Russia is proud of their “firehose of falsehood”, but the current rapid switching of narratives feels different.
Historically St. Petersburg has been called the "cultural capital" of Russia, with people there generally being a bit more aligned with Europe than the rest of the country.
So I think there should be more anti-Kremlin sentiment in St. Petersburg than in Moscow.
The Russian media and propaganda outlets are panicking and putting out lots of propaganda to counter the military and political losses that keep coming.
This is leading to a large number of disparate messages coming from different agencies that end up conflicting and cutting across each other.
The recruiting guys are putting out videos saying mobilisation is the only way out of poverty as the finance guys are saying the economy is stable.
The Russian propagandists are trumpeting small gains and the media is crying out about troop losses.
We usually see much less than 10 tanks and 20 APCs being lost in a day now.
I assume this is because they are running out.
Day 303.
It’s interesting to see Russias combat losses for the last month compared to the war as a whole.
While for the last month we’ve seen over 500 Russian troops lost per day.
This is more than 60% than the long term average.
The equipment losses aren’t going down because Russia is getting smarter or taking less risks.
If that were the case troop losses would be going down.
Instead, troop losses are increasing.
If anything, Russia is taking MORE risks and becoming MORE aggressive.
The equipment losses are going down because the troops who are dying aren’t as well equipped.
The most likely reason for this is Russia is starting to run out of tanks and APCs.
No one knows how big Russia’s equipment reserves are, but we are now seeing clear signals they are starting to run low.
It’s hard to say how bad this problem is for Russia right now, but it safe to say it will be disastrous for them in another 300 days.
