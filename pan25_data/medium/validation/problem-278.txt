Crime is down in NYC since the pandemic, murders are still well below the 90s and early 00s by a large margin, and crime overall even during the pandemic has been lower since 2015 than pre-2015, and people still bought into Zeldin’s ranting about a massive crime wave and almost elected him Governor.
Let's be clear about what happens if crime gets worse: Republicans win.
Full stop, people vote for Republicans because of fear, consistently, have for years.
Agreed on both parts but first responders as a whole and mental health has been overlooked for a long time.
But over the past few years I’ve noticed changes for the good on mental health and first responders.
The profession as a whole has always been slow to accept change.
The media’s been building up fear about a NYC crime wave for years and everyone just eats it up, and everyone seems to have an anecdote about why it’s so much worse yet the stats don’t back it up at all.
Hell, Eric Adams, who sucks in his own right, ran on it and it’s what gave him the edge in the Democratic primary over (in my opinion) much better candidates in Maya Wiley and Kathryn Garcia.
EDIT: Just realized I didn’t make it clear for anyone who doesn’t know NY/NYC politics that Eric Adams did not run for governor, he ran for Mayor of NYC and won last year.
He is a former cop, openly corrupt in many ways, and just overall sucks.
As for the many congressional House seats that flipped red: Dems fucked up redistricting.
They shot down a map drawn by our state’s bipartisan redistricting committee and tried to gerrymander hard in their own favor, the Republicans sued and won in the court of appeals, and filed the case in a very very red, rural district.
So the judge who oversaw the new redistricting and the special master he appointed were both Republicans who signed off on a map that was supposedly more neutral, but could also be leaning to favor Republicans a little more than could be expected with a truly neutral map.
Kathy Hochul is our governor and won re-election by a much more narrow margin than is usually expected for Dems over Republicans for statewide office, after Lee Zeldin campaigned almost entirely on Trumpism and “saving our state” from a nonexistent crime wave that he blamed her for causing.
Hochul’s only been around for a year or so as governor, and replaced a disgraced Andrew Cuomo after sexual harassment allegations, and many people held him responsible for a slew pandemic-related issues (some which were his fault and some which certainly were not).
Hochul was under fire early on for purchasing a large amount of Covid-19 tests from a campaign donor as well, after she took over.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
So there was a lot of bad blood, plus a lot of political incompetence from NYS Dems, and some really bad campaigning too.
Which led to NYS being one of the biggest pickups for House Republicans this year, and many state races being much more close than we’d have liked.
Dems are still the majority in NY, but they need to seriously revise their playbook.
So add the new maps to midterms and to media and politicians essentially screaming the “crime wave” nonsense to anyone would listen, and people just jumped on board the Republican wagon this year.
Yeah, the redistricting will be an issue that could have serious negative impacts statewide and nationally for years to come.
Hopefully we can fix our issues there before the next cycle in 2032, but until then we also need to get the statewide Democratic Party to frankly just… be better.
Too much infighting, too much stagnation on policy, a good bit of sleaziness and corruption.
Not a good look for Dems.
Not that the Republicans are any better, but it’s continually been proven that Republicans will vote for any candidate with an R while Dems usually only want to vote for the right candidate.
Yes, I don't think mass quitting 911 workers would necessarily make it worse, true, the perception however likely would get worse, and that's the goal for the right wing after all.
