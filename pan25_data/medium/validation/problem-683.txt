They have even stated what the goal is: to divide the United States and make everyone in the government eat eachother until democracy dies.
Wow, not even remotely shocked... its been factually obvious that Russia has been fucking with Republicans for atleast the last 5 years.
Russia has literally said that's what they are doing over and over including very recently.
Edit: They see the usa as the figure head of democracy, but really their attacks are much broader, they do the same meddling in any democratic nation that they see as a threat.
It's all about dividing and pitting against oneanother.
Unity is their greatest enemy and if they can divide and sour relationships its to their benift.
They give megaphones to anticovid groups for example, protests, groups online that are neo nazi, or rascit influencers, right wing talking heads that just create arguments, politicians, really any topic that gets people painting lines in the sand to fight eachother.
These 4 are about "Putins Chef" a man named Pirgozhin (an oligarch and founder of the wagner group) who recently, publicly stated he was actively funding groups to meddle with us elections.
This is about putin holding off on announcing the retreat from Kherson until after the midterms to not give Biden a win.
This is about Russia wanting the Republicans to win in the midterms so that they win in 2024 which they view as the best outcome for less support to Ukraine in the long term, but really if you just go to r/ukraine and talk to anyone there, they would also confirm that this is what Russia wants.
Also I can show how those troll farms the wagner founder created - along with GRU hacker groups - used the antimask/anti covid groups online to fuel the divide in the usa during the pandemic and how those same groups have dropped most of that nonsense for new talking points about not supporting ukraine.
The cousin and cash handler for one of Russia‚Äôs most notorious oligarchs poured tens of thousands of dollars into electing a newly minted congressman-elect who called Ukraine‚Äôs government ‚Äúa totalitarian regime.‚Äù.
Republican George Devolder-Santos vanquished Democrat Robert Zimmerman this month in the race for a House seat covering parts of Long Island and the New York City borough of Queens‚Äîriding a red wave that swept the Empire State this cycle, and washing away two decades of Democratic dominance in the district.
Devolder-Santos had long courted conservative media attention by presenting himself as a ‚Äúwalking, living, breathing contradiction‚Äù‚Äîa gay Latino millennial born in New York City, who is also a fervent devotee of ex-President Donald Trump.
But the candidate stood out to the Washinon Post earlier this year for his remarks in the aftermath of Russia‚Äôs bloody, unprovoked assault on Ukraine.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like Ukraine is a great democracy.
It‚Äôs a totalitarian regime.
They‚Äôre not a great bastion of freedom,‚Äù the congressman-to-be told the paper.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
There you go.
Now this is all very recent stuff, if you like I can dig up clips of Russian state television using tucker carlson as talking points also üòÜ plus I can probably find a bunch of things to show that they focus heavily on the Republicans and see them as the easiest to manipulate to their benift.
Devolder-Santos also insisted that Ukraine ‚Äúwelcomed the Russians into their provinces‚Äù‚Äîan apparent reference to President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs 2014 invasion to prop up rogue separatist parties‚Äîand that Ukrainians in the east ‚Äúfeel more Russian than Ukrainian,‚Äù even though every single Ukrainian province overwhelmingly voted for independence in 1991.
But unreported until now is that by the time Devolder-Santos made these statements, his congressional ambitions had already received a $32,800 boost from a controversial figure linked to the uppermost echelons of the Russian regime‚Äîand that support would more than double in size during the months ahead.
It was not the first time Devolder-Santos had parroted Kremlin talking points.
In the weeks before Putin‚Äôs brutal, blundering attack upon his western neighbor, the candidate repeatedly took to Twitter to accuse President Joe Biden of plotting to ‚Äústart a war‚Äù with Russia and deploy American troops to Ukraine.
