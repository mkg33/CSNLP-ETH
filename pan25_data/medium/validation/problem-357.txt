Violence based on the victim's race, sexual orientation, or religion usually gets far more attention than other violence.
If a group of white students stoned a black student over the victim's race, or a group of cis students stoned a trans or gay student over the victim's orientation, it would probably get disproportionate attention as well?
But it's a lot harder to discuss that, so they attack religion as a whole instead reading the article or participating in a nuanced conversation about the complex topic of race relations in the 21st century.
Actually that would be Antitheist, Atheist is just not believing in any of the 2500+ fairytale wizards.
Antitheist is not entertaining people who need an imaginary man in the skies to master life.
The mother of one of the students who was attacked said that "these meetings are essential and I hope they continue.
Just because there are such incidents doesn't mean you have to give up.
Everyone has to learn to get along and the educators are there to pave the right way for both sides.
