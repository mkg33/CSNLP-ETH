The Dalai Lama is a monk in one school of Tibetan Buddhism (he’s actually not even in charge of the school).
There are other monks who are in charge/leaders of the the rest of Tibetan Buddhism schools.
I remember something like the head of the religion will be with them and they'll use it in some way right?
This means anyone who claims to be the reincarnated Dalai Lama not approved by the CCP will have broken the law.
How the fuck do you get government approval for fucking reincarnation and how do they even know who's who and how do they even know reincarnation exists.
When the Panchen Lama died, the Dalai Lama (at least his representatives) was able to help look/got reports for the Panchen Lama.
They made the announcement before China which posses the Chinese off and showed that the Dalai Lama still has considerable influence in Tibet.
So China kidnapped the Panchen Lama and installed a fake Chinese chosen Panchen Lama.
In his school of Buddhism there is also the Panchen Lama who is a high monk.
Historically when one dies the other helps find the new one.
This isn’t imperative but it’s what was occasionally done.
That's the point.
It doesn't matter whether it "works" or not.
They're just trying to catch anyone who claims it does - so that only their approved people can claim divine right.
Now, it’s assumed/plausible that when the Dalai Lama does China will select a new Dalai Lama and bring out the Panchen Lama that the Dalai Lama found in the 90’s to confirm the pick.
All this said, the Dalai Lama has said it’s up to him for the reincarnation plan (he said that he may not reincarnate, but he certainly will).
Tibetans aren’t going to buy into the Chinese Dalai Lama just like they haven’t bought into the fake Chinese Panchen Lama.
