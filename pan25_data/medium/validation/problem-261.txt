I mean it's sad when anyone dies unnecessarily but I feel like 20 million guns that can only be associated with 36 total deaths across 9 months is not that bad all things considered.
Still.
AR pattern rifles are hardly ever used shootings.
Thatâ€™s the point here.
And no they are not used in one of shootings unless you one of those tHiNk oF tHe PoOr HoMe InVaDeR types.

Mass shootings are any shooting with 3 or more victims.
I would genuinely be curious as to how many shootings with Ar15s where there were fewer than 3 people shot actually happen.
I suspect it is a very small number.
20 million guns and those guns were responsible for a total of 36 deaths in the year so far in a nation of 330 million people.
