It's also worth noting that the subsidized daycares make up 75% of all daycares in the province.
It's not just a few of them.
We couldn't get into a fully subsidized one.
So my daughter goes to a private one and with the rebate it comes out to $18/day.
We just moved back from living in NYC and had she had to go while we still lived there, it would have cost $100-$150/day.
Obviously perspective is relative but $18 feels like nothing.
It should be noted that Yukon and Quebec have already achieved $10/day child care.
Quebec's system in particular has been in place since 1997, and costs $8.50/day.
British Columbia has begun opening a significant number of $10/day centres, and all other provinces will have achieved some level of fee reduction by the end of this year, some by 50%.
In America it's common for the spouse with a lower paying job to stop working during child care years.
Giving up the lower income is usually cheaper or on par with daycare.
We (in Quebec) also offer free daycare to parents who meet additional criteria.
Basically, those with even less means to pay.
