It's not unheard of for teens to start having sex at 13-ish in the West, and those efforts often don't involve protection.
I think the majority of people consider kinder to grade 6 (maybe grade 9 in some places- primary is k-6 where I live) primary school and highschool secondary and then university is Post Secondary so it would be veeeeeryyyyyyy alarming if there was 1500 kids under the age of 13 pregnant.
Still fucked up, but the main reason I also copied OPs reaction is because primary school where I grew up was only kindergarten and 1st grade (and T-1, still mad my parents wasted a year of my life in that bs) and thereâ€™s elementary (2nd - 5th grade) then middle school (6th - 8th) then high school.
This provided a lot of much needed info thanks.
It's always been k-8 wherever I've lived.
Sometimes 7-8 are split off into middle school, but I'd still consider that part of "primary" (i.e.
before secondary) schooling.
Ceramics, jewelry, carved ornaments, clothing, etc.
Stores and such run by volunteers, with profits going to back into the program to invest in more product and other craftsman.
Nepal, South Africa, India, Philippines, Peru, Thailand, etc.
Similar to how you can buy Free trade coffee or cocoa and know the farmer is getting a good price, except craftsmen, and it's primarily volunteers so all kinds of margins are reduced to go back into the programs.
You feel like everyone is crazy, until it's pointed out that much of their history has been affected by outside countries meddling via their elite or some other form of corruption.
There actually are deep states functioning there.
Again, I'm not saying we don't have issues but it's nothing like growing up in that environment -- and then you get to Africa and it's so far beyond it that it feels like game over.
You start wondering how their issues are solvable from their starting point, but you meet amazing people and hope they are.
We have no idea just how good we in the West have it.
Across the board, just no idea.
We take it all for granted.
Everything.
I volunteered in the poorest county of Mississippi once where I encountered people with dirt floors and no running water and it still wasn't close the same level.
We argue about weird culture issues and the price of netflix because we can, we have that little to worry about.
Many there are institutionalized to physical and sexual violence and other hard realities in ways we can't wrap our heads around.
There's wisdom there, but also profound ignorance that was sometimes mutual.
I remember being in parts of Turkey and half the conversations felt like talking to a conspiracy theorist going on about 9/11 or Covid coming from 5G.
You could see it in their eyes that everything was a conspiracy based on outside forces or the deep state -- everything \-- to the point where they'd see video footage and they were sure it was all staged and start making conspiracies on the spot.
But yeah, I'd stay away unless you know where you're going and with people who know what they're doing.
It's so much larger than any books prepared me for.
It's hard for Europeans to understand the size of America and hard for us to understand Africa.
It's big, with areas of aching beauty and people full of of the same.
We say the word culture, but we often think of it as an innate beautiful thing.
Culture is simply a learned behavior, and not all learned behaviors are created equal.
We romanticize parts of the world without understanding just how fortunate we are to have certain ways of doing and acting instilled in us.
That we have the expectation that some things are wrong.
It doesn't mean we don't need to keep improving, but we also need to be profoundly grateful.
I had friends that were part of NGOs, that one worked with local craftspeople in economically depressed areas of the world with few skills that's kind of Free Trade on steroids.
e.g., they'd give them small amounts of seed money to buy materials to make things that were part of their culture that they'd then purchase and could be exported to the West to be sold by volunteer organizations.
e.g., there's a group of women in the Peru highlands that knit hats from alpaca wool, making about x3 the regional wage and (almost as important) around their schedule.
If you do a search for the Peru highlands you'll get a sense that economic options are very limited, and even if there was a factory they have a family to look after -- there's no daycare or fast foods and stuff has to happen.
In some cases they help setup and then work through local groups.
I want to be careful about linking, but if you search for "Peru Sierra Knit Hat" or "Kenya Unity Kisii Soapstone Sculpture" you'll get the gist.
Plato's allegory is actually a fascinating way of representing how different our frames of reference are that hadn't occurred to me.
Thanks mate, glad that's in my head for when I talk about it in the future.
Africa was way bigger than the globes I grew up with made it out to be, or at least in my head.
Like three times the size of the USA, to where you could fit all of the USA, China, Europe, India, etc.
, the place is astoundingly large.
The other comment covered this really, but in my experience it's really difficult for Europeans to really understand how large and spread out America is.
You can drive from the farthest tip West in Germany to the Farthest tip East in about 7 hours.
Texas alone is 15-16 hours.
In the 15 hours it'll take to drive from say, Boston to Chicago you'd have crossed multiple European countries.
Just to get from Boston to NYC is 4 hours and it's just down the coast (leave longer to stop for New Haven pizza).
