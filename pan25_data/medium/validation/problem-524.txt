>"This is a big win in our talks, that we have a double profit.
Both strenhening security in Ukraine, by defending the Ukrainian sky, but we also have strenhening of our anti-missile and anti-aircraft defence," Morawiecki said.
In my head they are both high ranking politician of a political party, which routinely insults, denigrates and provokes my country and the german people.
I really do not care what dimwitted fool spoke this, seeing as the party itself saw it fit not to intervene on his behalf for this incredibly stupid take.
Truly the most humble and honest politician.
Yes of course only Poland with itÂ´s perfect and trusting relationship to Germany could have possibly moved Germany to send the patriot system.
Not of course the fact that Germany sent basically all kinds of air defense as much as it could.
Iris-T, Gepards, Stinger and now the Patriot system.
A system that before could not be sent as the US declined export permission when Ukraine asked.
Now that the US is sending one system and is already training the Ukrainians in Germany on the system, they get a german system as well.
I somehow very much doubt that you would care to know the different name off the minister if you read in the headline that some german minister insulted your country.
