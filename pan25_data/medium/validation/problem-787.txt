"They" talk about it all the time.
It's not a secret that a good chunk of population growth in many developed countries, where the birth rate of generations-native citizens tends to be lower than the replacement index, is through immigration.
It's a fact of human behavior and economics that richer, more developed countries see their birth rates go down.
People increasingly find they don't need a bunch of children for whatever reason, or that they don't want children, or that they can't have children and maintain a lifestyle they like.
But that's not the case in poorer countries.
And when those poorer immigrants come over, generation after generation, their birth rate starts to trend towards their new country's.
I have some family that did make the big move about seven years back and recently got citizenship.
They are happier than ever.
Abject racists say it all the time.
The media says it all the time.
Politicians on every side say it all the time.
This is not some deep secret, though there's largely only one reason people like to harp on "immigrants being responsible for population growth" as some (insidious) negative: bigotry.
Sure, some try and gussy it up by saying they're concerned about worker exploitation, but those same folks don't give a hot gay fuck about that exploitation any other time, so it's obvious concern trolling.
I lived in Western NY for college and the cold/dark almost broke me, though; so, I don’t think I’ll ever be able to do it.
