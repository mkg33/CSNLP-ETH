He didn't defrock this cardinal although he did accept his age-mandated retirement in 2006 at 75 years of age.
McCarrick was almost as popular as the pope, this would have been devastating.
A ton of Catholic officials knew about him, likely Benedict.
If you can't even get simple, easily searchable facts such as his job title and time served correct, why should we believe a word you say about his crimes?
Especially since you lie, intentionally and with malevolence, about him covering up crimes.
He didnâ€™t do anything, at all, as Archbishop; he was entirely ineffectual.
He was a lifelong academic who was appointed Archbishop primarily so he could be eventually kicked upstairs.
He was nothing but a rubber stamp in the archdiocese, which was actually run by his auxiliary bishops.
I don't even like the guy - I think like all religious figures, he caused far more harm than good - but if you scatter errors in fact and easily debunked lies throughout your statement no one is going to trust you.
