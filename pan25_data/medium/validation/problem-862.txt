After going after trans children and people seeking abortions, Florida Gov.
Ron DeSantis has set his sights on a new target: potential death row inmates.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
After that you can shoot them, starve them, lock them up or send them off to war...whatever makes you the most money!
“Maybe eight out of twelve have to agree?
Or something.
But we can’t be in a situation where one person can just derail this,” DeSantis said on Jan. 23, referring to death penalty verdicts left unachieved because of a so-called “rogue” juror.
While speaking to the Florida Sheriff’s Association, DeSantis spoke of his frustration with requiring unanimous jury recommendations before handing down death sentences.
And he appears to want to make it easier.
He wants to look as tough as Trump.
Trump had 13 federal inmates executed in the last 6 months of his presidency after 17 years without a single execution.
He thought it would make him look tough.
