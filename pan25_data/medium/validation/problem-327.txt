One key caveat is that Putin didn’t inform his security council of the plan to invade until it was largely underway.
Had kyiv fallen in 3 days as projected, it would not have mattered.
But because of his hubris, ukrainian bravery, and his compartmentalization, he removed any last trust between his upper echelon and himself.
The systemic breakdown within the FSB can be seen starting during their “raids” on “Ukrainian Jewish Nazis” in moscow.
The sims games, nazi paraphernalia, and “get incriminating signature” and their keystone cops, medium speed door approach all reeks of malicious compliance.
This is the Russian equivalent of the NSA and CIA.
If they are truly that incompetent then Russia was doomed long before.
But if it was malicious compliance then they are just fed up with the mob boss being enriched while they do the heavy lifting.
It's thus not at all surpring if a lot of the guys who both are much more likely the be in the loop with regards to the true state of Russia and who are in an area which is a lot about operating covertly, are quietly working to get rid of Putin and his clique.
If Putin was relying on the esprit de corps to, because he was a former member, keep the FSB rank and file on his side (the guy who has been "the boss" for more than a decade), his very public dressing down of the head of the FSB early on for the invasion failures (rather than, you know, the corruption that starts at the very top and drained the military of its power) would've cement him as "not one of us" in many minds and maybe even as "the biggest danger to Russia" amongst those FSB members who are genuine patriots.
Russia just fully believed that Ukraine leadership would cut and run and they would be able to do a phase 2 of the donbas invasion and force everyone to adopt a Russian passport to function.
There is a Ukrainian HUMINT that started doing interrogation/interviews early on.
His name is Volodimir zolkin and he is honestly one of the best I’ve ever seen.
He is just soft and lets people talk.
