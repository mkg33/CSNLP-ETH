He is extremely well known in the street art community as well as fine art crowds that over pay for pieces of his work.
Banksy does stencils in layers, he is literally putting a piece of paper up and spraying over it and adding another layer to do the same until it's finished.
The image does not agree with the description of the graffiti in the lower article.
There is a second image in the lower article of a grown male judo competitor being thrown to the ground by a child competitor that makes more sense.

What does it do to help the people of Ukraine?
To me it's an art collective or artist using an ongoing conflict for publicity.
Banksy probably didn't know anything about Ukraine before Russia invaded, except the name of its capital city.
The war is in the media every day, and most European countries are doing their best to help refugees flee the conflict, so exposure for the war can't be the reason.
As I said, this is more like self exposure.
