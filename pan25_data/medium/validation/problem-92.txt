Edit: Olympics needs to be in quotations because it’s the IOC’s bastardized version of Olympics.
There could be other versions if people wanted to build them.
True.
The IOC asks cities to build facilities for sports hardly anybody plays or watches and continuously changes the events making old facilities useless.
Honestly people need to realize the IOC is an international body that does not “own” the Olympics.
Greece should just launch its own and declare itself the home.
They even tried to remove wrestling one time.
You know one of the few sports that’s near universal to humanity since antiquity and in the original Olympic Games.
I’d love for Europe to be like f it, we make a campus in Greece and each country gets a stadium/ facilities there to build and maintain themselves.
Make it the sports capital of the world.
Out of everything here, the coke products in hotel minibars just seems extra weird.
Coke are sponsors, why not just give them their own coke branded mini bars to put in the hotels?
Athens can't afford it without support.
Countries won't be willing to support because hosting is a prestige thing.
IoC has no more power than the countries who fund it allow.
