It puts the GOP in a weird spot because you know they want to say "What Biden did is WORSE than Trump" but that would also be an admission that what Trump did is in the realm of bad.
And that implication will make Trump have a fit.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
If this was all premeditated, this is 4d chess.
Find classified documents, go through the correct process, comply with any investigation that arises.
Demonstrate how this is supposed to happen without...idk bringing a corrupt judge into it only to have that judge smacked down too.
And then sit back and wait for the "both sides" people to tie themselves in a knot.
At first I thought it was damaging, that it diminished Trump's crimes.
But as Biden plays it by the book, stays uninvolved and gets back to work, it is a remarkable contrast with Trump - calling the special council a terrorist and demanding 'his' documents back, while he sits around raging on social media from his retirement home.
Legally the Biden documents should have no relevance to the Trump case.
Politically the Trump supporters lack the cognitive ability to distinguish between the two cases.
Actually since Trump has such a powerful mind he accidentally declassified the Biden documents when he was thinking about all the documents he needed to psychically declassify.
.
He had intended to only include the Mar-a-Lago documents but instead used the overly broad "all documents stored in unapproved locations tag".

Trump "Truthed" asking when the FBI is going to raid the White House (along with other Biden residences).
How stupid do you have to be to include the White House in a list of places you suspect of improperly housing classified documents?
Trump is the one who notified the press about the search of his Mar-a-Lago residence.
If he hadn't gone public and cooperated (even at that point) the whole documents scandal might have gone unnoticed.
There is a good chance that the Biden team did a pre-emptive sweep for any documents to head off GOP investigations.
Unfortunately they did discover some classified documents.
Assuming the possession was inadvertent, at a minimum it indicates better procedures need to be put in place for outgoing politicians and "their" property.
