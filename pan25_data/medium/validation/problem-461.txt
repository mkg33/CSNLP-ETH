if you're interested in what was going on, i hate the mother fucker too, but the "threat to national security" was not Canada in and of itself, but the fact that importing steel from Canada was cheaper and many of our steel plants had gone offline.
In the event of a major war that suspends or hampers global trade, we would be in a weakened state until we could get in-country steel operations up and running again.
Aluminum was another one.
The issue actually isn't that we don't make it at all, its that our in-country operations only specialized in the highest quality steel and aluminum that could sell for the highest price, but not every application requires that quality of metal, which is why we were still exporting steel even though we were also importing a ton of steel.
I actually can't remember if Canada was specifically about Aluminum or Steel but the point remains the same.
I remember a thread where someone legitimately asked about good things (bills he promoted or executive orders he gave) he did as president and there were 2 actual answers.
