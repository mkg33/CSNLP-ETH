- This isn’t normal Lake Effect snow.
My friend’s yard is covered in six feet of snow in less than two days and some areas maxed out at 7.
Last time we got anything like this was in 2014.
Schools and many businesses are still closed.
- Just 13 miles up the road from said friend, I personally got maybe a foot and half of snow.
2-3 feet in one storm over the course of a few days is what most consider normal Lake Effect, but 3 inches an hour in some places this time far from it.
Long Island and the Hudson Valley are responsible for flips, with Long Island’s 4 seats now completely red.
