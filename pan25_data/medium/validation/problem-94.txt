- Nigel Farage and John Redwood rail against news of senior Tories joining cross-party summit to tackle failings of Brexit.
This is not discussed enough.. Russia was involved and even investigations by the Home Office found paper trails and multiple other sources have found clear evidence of Russian donations, advertising, propaganda, and funding for Nigel Farage and John Redwood.
You would need to be naive to think that Brexit was not caused largely by Russian fear and propaganda.
Russian interference in the 2016 Brexit referendum is a debated subject and remains unproven, though multiple sources argue evidence exists demonstrating that the Russian government attempted to influence British public opinion in favor of leaving the European Union.\[...\].
According to a US senate report, Russian state media channel RT covered the referendum campaign extensively and offered "systematically one-sided coverage".
Data released by Twitter in 2018 identified 3,841 accounts of Russian origin affiliated with the Internet Research Agency, as well as 770 potentially from Iran, which collectively sent over 10 million Tweets in "an effort to spread disinformation and discord", according to The Telegraph, with a "day-long blitz" on the day of the referendum.
One study, with a sample of 1.5 million tweets containing hashtags relating to the referendum, found that almost a third of all tweets had been generated by just 1% of the 300,000 sampled accounts.
They found that both pro-Leave and pro-Remain bots existed but that "the family of hashtags associated with the argument for leaving the EU dominates", with pro-Leave bots tweeting more than three times as often.
In September 2020, the Electoral Commission raised concerns about Russia-linked donations to the Tories that occurred prior to the Brexit referendum.
In October 2021, the Pandora Papers revealed more information about the potentially Kremlin-linked donations and multiple others.
