Considering what Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett have said, such an extreme decision looks very unlikely.
I am not surprised in the slightest by that.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Pfft.
Even with the most extreme ruling possible, they are no longer in a strong enough position in state legislatures to overturn a Presidential election, and when you look at how their internal divisions are now starting to cost them control of legislative chambers even when they hold majorities of seats, I think their position will only weaken further.
I think this is going to backfire disastrously on the Republicans if they issue a pro-ISL decision regardless of how extreme or “moderate” it is.
2014 is long gone, and these midterms show as much.
Republicans actually have to worry about voters now and their internal factions are at each others’ throats.
Moore v. Harper is not going to save them from that.
I think they’re trying to hold jelly together with rubber bands.
Sure, certain potentialities are frightening, but I don’t think they’re internally unified enough to pull them off and at this point they are falling off a demographic cliff.
