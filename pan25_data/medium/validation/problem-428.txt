Germans have a shortage of energy.
EWN Entsorgungswerk f√ºr Nuklearanlagen GmbH spent millions on propaganda funded by rail lines it owned in the 80s to persuade public opinion into decommissioning the majority of nuclear.
Coal is too dirty.
Renewables haven't exactly worked out all that great as far as price goes.
Not enough trees for wood fires for every home.
So I guess Germany just wants to buy its energy from other sovereign states?
I just read about several Eastern Europe sovereign States that can't afford energy because Germany is outbidding them so they're signing deals with Russia and others to build more nuclear power plants and to supply them with fuel.
Basically Germany just outsourced its energy production.
I'm fairly certain the German government is trying to save face here they need the coal but they don't want to admit that decommissioning nuclear was a mistake.
Not all that expensive, especially when you don't necessarily have to rely on flights.
Pretty good train links across the continent and free movement.
It's about as easy/cheap as visiting other states in the US, or driving up to Canada if you live near enough to the border.
