Blatter wasn't in favour of Qatar as a host (he is still corrupt due to other issues) but Platini, president of UEFA was in favour of QATAR.
He initially wanted to vote for the US but changed his mind after a dinner with Sarkozy and Al Thani.
Just a coincidence of course, like Platini's son getting a well-paid consultant role at Qatar Sport Invest afterwards.
European clubs weren't happy with the Winter WC because it is interfering with their European season.
The ECA was flown to Qatar and after returning most clubs stopped their resistance for a winter world cup.
Just a coincidence, like Rummenigge, head of the ECA during that time, getting caught with 2 Rolex at customs from returning to Munich from Qatar.
PSG not only get sponsored by Qatar, but after getting the World Cup they bought the club and spent seemingly endless money to make PSG a European Top Club.
BeIn bought the TV licenses for multiple European leagues (Bundesliga, La Liga, Premier League, Champions League and of course Ligue Un) and overpaid for it (at least for the French and German League).
Just another coincidence, I am sure.
Some Superclubs wanted to make their own Champions League and wanted "to leave" UEFA.
Long messy story short: Paris, of course, wasn't interested in joining the Super League and UEFA rewarded Paris owner, Al-Khelaifi, by making him the Chairman of the ECA.
I don't think UEFA were really against the Qatar World Cup and is simply happy that FIFA gets all the flack, while everybody ignores their greed.
The plurality of the blame for corruption in FIFA falls on officials who were originally from Europe and/or associated with UEFA.
I do think UEFA is the only federation that has enough power for this to maybe work on its own, but Europe has been allowing this version of FIFA to exist since the 70s and its not like there weren't tons of previous corrupt acts.
FIFA officials don't even care if you get publicly caught doing corrupt things, as long as you pay them they will continue to re-elect you.
In most organizations if you get publicly outed then your done.
