Good lord i've been hearing this crap for a decade now.
BRICS will never make its own currency and its absurd to even suggest that that will.
The Saudis won't do shit they need the US to deal with Iran.
Would you care to guess who is allied with Iran?
That's right, most BRICS countries.
The US dollar is still in good shape as its dominate share of world reserves is well-entrenched.
Most debts and agreements are done in US dollars, even if the agreement doesn’t involve the US whatsoever.
This is because of good property rights, the rule of law in the United States, and deep capital markets.
If you are holding US dollar assets, those are deep markets in which you can trade them.
Countries like China don’t even have deep capital markets to begin with.
BRICS isn't new.
And I think the only reason why there was a lull in the media about it was due to Bolsonaro trying to distance Brazil from it altogether.
It's not "new", but it wasn't ever really "a thing" in the sense that these five countries were actually coordinating economic policy.
In short, none of the five countries have a currency that's a good candidate for denominating your trade, if you're not trading with that country.
China has a lot of capital controls to prevent outflow of capital (which would result in the appreciation of its currency against the dollar and make their exports less attractive).
India and Brazil have somewhat freer finances but also have significantly less volume of trade.
South Africa's just in bad economic shape in general.
I trust I don't need to go into reasons that the ruble might not be an attractive currency in which to write futures contracts?
But if you are looking for countries that aren't solidly within the West (i.e.
developed countries that are also within the US security umbrella, and thus can't casually buck US economic policies without having to worry about security issues), and you can kind of handwave their individual problems as "averaging out" so that you don't have to address them directly... and of course if you ignore that Russia doesn't work and play well with others and that China and India can get along... then you can pretend that an economic bloc exists with enough size to serve as a potential alternative to the US-led West!
If countries stop trading oil in USD then they will no longer need to keep the amounts of USD that lead them to use it for other international trade.
If countries start using their own currencies, instead of USD, for international trade, that is when I think the USD will have issues.
I am no fortune teller and can't predict the future, but the US today benefits for the this oil-trade-in-USD arrangement.
The main factor I am following is whether or not Saudi Arabia starts selling oil in non-USD currencies.
That arrangement has held since the 70s.
I am not sure what the world would look like if that changes.
It's kind of like talking about the PIIGS group (i.e.
Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, Spain).
Sure, they're all countries on the EU perimeter and have some common economic interests in that sense, but they also have a lot of differences and don't -actually- act in concert, nor are they likely to start doing so just because.
> An enlarged BRICS group may or may not include oil and gas heavyweights Iran and Saudi Arabia.
But if intra-BRICS commodity trade were to be settled in a commodity-linked basket of currencies among members as well as willing non-members, it would constitute an effective end to the petrodollar, a key pillar of the G7-led global financial system.
