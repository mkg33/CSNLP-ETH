It’s why when Obama took the Republican healthcare Plan and called it ObamaCare, it went from being a “free market solution” to “big government socialist hand outs” when there was not substantive changes to the scheme.
I think you underestimate Trump's selfishness and disloyalty to anyone other than himself.
He cares about Trump and that is it.
If DeSantis wins he will still undoubtedly run as a third party and take his 10-20% MAGA base with him, even if he knows it will doom Republicans.
Because in his mind it would just be punishment to Republicans for rejecting him.
Trump is only your ally as long as you help him, but the second you show the slightest inkling of going against him you become public enemy number 1.
Just look at his attacks on DeSantis and Youngkin and they haven't even done anything yet!
So no matter how much they seem to fracture, they will come back together.
It is not about politics or policy.
Conservatism is more of a life style brand, a part of their personal identity.
Consistency, logic and hypocrisy don’t matter at all.
It doesn’t matter how is at the front of the mob, that person isn’t really steering the mob.
They are just riding the cresting wave of anger and resentment.
You really under estimate the effect of group think.
The GOP will let trump and Desantis fight it out and then everyone will pretend the winner was always the one everyone supported.
The loser will either be cast out or bent his knee to the new king.
It won’t matter much who is the top dog.
Trump was not the cause of the problem with the GOP, neither is Desantis.
They are both symptoms, they are just cogs in a machine that is not under anyone’s direct control.
It is so fascinating, how the various parts of the machine work, pushing everyone further to the right, because the only consistent ideology from any republican is that the democrats are evil and they must be stopped at all cost, no matter what they are doing.
The GOP won't have to blackmail or strongarm President Pigshit if any of the criminal cases he might be facing end the way they rightfully should.
And oddly, that may be the endgame much of the GOP wants to see after he's lost them 3 election cycles.
Luckily -- or maybe unluckily since it would be entertaining as all hell to watch Pigshit try to run a campaign from Cell Block C -- felons are banned from elected office.
Some people would follow trump to a third party, that may the the tectonic shift needed to let the rational actors of the GOP break the chains of the ever increasing extremism that bind the party now.
The party can’t go anyway but further right without angering their base.
But the base was been radicalized over generations of misinformation from right wing media, politicians and churches.
It’s like a bus on the edge of a cliff and no one is driving, but it can’t do anything but speed up and move closer to the cliff’s edge.
So they had a plan which would require everyone to purchase health insurance.
It is literally the only health insurance plan the republicans ever had.
They could have so easily won the debate by saying ObamaCare was just rebranded RomneyCare and that the democrats were so intellectually bankruptcy that they had to steal conservative ideas to govern.
They could have run as the party of ideas and solutions.
BUT it would have required giving the democrats a win, which the GOP cannot do as they spent decades convincing people that democrats eat babies.
So the GOP created a system where they can’t compromise or moderate their positions.
They have framed policy debate as a fight of good verse evil.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Yeah I have a feeling if Trump announces and starts seeming like the frontrunner they will all fall back in line.
Since 2016 Trump has had low points where it looks like the GOP may split from him (2018 midterms, 2020 election, January 6th, etc), but within a few weeks he always seems to get everyone back because he has a stranglehold on 30-50% of the GOP voter base who would walk off a cliff for him.
Now if DeSantis or someone else is able to put up a challenge or even win the nomination, I think the party gets split.
Trump will be on the ticket in 2024 no matter what.
Trump has bent knee to Putin, because Putin appeared strong to trump.
Trump is weak and scared.
His last best hope was a red wave taking Congress from the democrats.
Trump sees a way back to power and safety.
He knows that he can’t trust anyone in the GOP to protect him.
But if trump can be convinced that Desantis will protect him above all else, then he would gladly support Desantis.
So even if trump and Desantis completely destroy each other and the party apparatus, it will change nothing.
Other people will take up the banner of right wing extremisms and will be immediately well funded and supported by the ownership class who think they can ride the bus to crazy town and that they will be protected by their money and power.
In the sense that the ACA plan, ObamaCare was originally developed by the Heritage Foundation back during the Clinton Administration when the republicans were terrified that the US would start a single payer health insurance system, like all of the developed countries have.
Obama acknowledged it.
It was widely talked about back in the day.
