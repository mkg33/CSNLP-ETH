I cannot even imagine how difficult this must be for the people living in affected areas of Syria.
The relief efforts in Turkiye have shown complete devastation, but between years of war, the oppressive regime and now this catastrophic disaster… people are still living in portions of the damaged and collapsed buildings in Syria in the snow because there is just no place else for them to go.
unfathomable experiences for so many of us elsewhere in the world.
I have been wondering for a while, before earthquake everyone used Turkey but shortly after it, everyone changed to turkiye.
Did the earthquake shift the nameplate?
Is this another one of those nelson mandela effect?
Like the commenter below stated, the spelling change has been a thing for a while.
Actually, i believe the country has been collectively referred to as Türkiye from within its borders since the declaration of the Republic in 1923.
More recently, upon request, the UN began using the spelling Türkiye in Jan 2022.
Seems in part due to this spelling better reflecting the people and culture of the region, and in part to avoid association with the bird (which, ironically, is referred to as “hindi” in Turkish, translated as “Indian chicken”).
Will there be a change in how we refer to the country's people and the country's language from Turkish to something else, since Turkish is based on Turkey with -ish appendage?
