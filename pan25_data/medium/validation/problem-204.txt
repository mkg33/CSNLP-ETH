It’s even better than that.
Kevin McCarthy originally wanted to be Speaker back when John Boehner (remember him?
lol) retired back in 2015, and he was originally the front-runner.
But he ended up not having the votes because the Freedom Caucus gave him the finger, and that was back when the GOP had a solid majority, not just one where they’re hanging on by their eyelashes.
So they ended up convincing Paul Ryan to run instead (which, he originally didn’t even want to).
