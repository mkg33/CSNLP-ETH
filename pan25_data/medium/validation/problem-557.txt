The benefits of COVID to Biden's campaign really can't be overstated, and it goes beyond just the effects it had on Trump's popularity, which were substantial.
Getting Biden off the trail and getting him much more rest and limiting his exposure to almost exclusively short, prepared appearances was a God-send for that campaign.
When he was going through the regular campaign rigmarole, he was not handling it well.
It seemed like at least a couple times a week he'd have some weird, troubling episode like calling someone a dog-faced pony soldier, challenging someone to a pushup contest, forgetting the preamble to the constitution, forgetting the names of his primary opponents, the leg hair monologue, etc.
Putting him in a lower-stress, less-public bubble clearly had a huge positive impact on his ability to demonstrate competence, at which point people were more easily able to toss him an "I like Obama" vote or otherwise talk themselves into settling for him.
