You’d think some friend might show them the news from every other source the day the Jan 6 committee recommended the Cheeto be charged criminally, and how fox just showed … what was it … nothing news basically.
You’d think that would piss them off and stop watching it.

The satire station where every host has admitted under oath that they are lying and no sane person would believe a word they say?
