The morality of the US is not the topic here, but they are valid complaints too.
The problem here is the way in which those slights were exposed, did more than just expose them, but also unnecessarily put people at risk and weakened national security.
To many other nations, this is irrelevant...but if Assange did not want to attract the US's attention, he obviously went about it the wrong way.
Several of the counts relate to the Rules of Engagement documents given to US forces in Iraq - i.e.
telling when and how they can open fire.
The indictment argues that those could have been used by enemy forces to more effectively attack American troops.
He actively buried any leaks that were Russia-related, and selectively released American leaks with the intent to influence an election.
He's nothing more than Putin's useful idiot.
He allowed leaked cables to go through, un redacted, that put operatives at risk and/or got them killed.
There's still a limit to "just reporting."
There is still responsibility.
