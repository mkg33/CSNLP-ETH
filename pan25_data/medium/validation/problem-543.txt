Developing countries in the global south will be disproportionally impacted by climate change despite contributing relatively little to the problem.
The point of this aid is not to slow global warming, it's to help poor countries prepare for the now inevitable impacts.
Why would you say these are "random" governments when the aid is specifically being targeted to nations being severely impacted by climate change (such as Pakistan, which just experienced the worst flooding in living memory)?
A lot of this aid won't go directly to foreign governments.
A large portion of development aid from the US, for example, goes through multilateral organizations and NGOs working overseas.
The article doesn't specifically say how much any country will contribute to the fund, but it clearly states that China is part of the donor base.
Even if China weren't contributing, would that absolve other developed countries of responsibility?
Your view is that if one country doesn't agree to addressing an injustice, no country should?
Pretty shit take IMO.
Easy to sit at your keyboard and shit on foreign aid when you're clueless about how it actually works.
It was an honest question.
Some might view China as developing and they have been reluctant to take any global responsibility.
The rest is you making assumptions about my motivations.
