This comment needs to be higher.
The Heritage Foundation is one of the nuttier right wing ‘think’ tanks (heavy, heavy emphasis on the quote marks around ‘think’).
As an example, the Heritage Foundation is one of the big spreaders about the myth of election/voting fraud in the US.
They claim it’s rampant, but even their own listing of actual incidents amounts to just a couple thousand incidents out of billions of votes cast.
They just don’t like calling it that bc their dads and grandpas fought against it in WWII, as well as having a hand in indoctrinating the US populace into thinking that those words are exclusive to only Mussolini, Hitler, and WWII-Cold War-ish leaders.
If you find a conservative/GOP’er, and ask them if they agree with any of the main characteristics of Fascism, w/o telling them it’s Fascism, they’ll definitely agree to a number of them.
Let’s forget about natural virus for a second and say in the future, a foreign country uses a deadly novel virus to attack the US, do you think the US will do a better job?
Nah.
Stop being blindly arrogant and naïve.
