Whilst true, in fairness there are also a lot of people who have been attempting to complete their paperwork with plenty of time to spare who have been unable to due to local administrative problems.
It’s not as cut and dried as “person couldn’t be bothered to complete paperwork in due time and complains about consequences”.
Portugal is epically shit administratively at this sort of thing, they don’t discriminate against Brits though.
They are also epically shit in the U.K. at their consulate in London for their own passport holders.
France is also crap, regional results may vary but again, outside of the big cities it helps to know someone who can move things along.
Italy seems to be pretty good though, not sure about Spain or Germany.
Germany has probably been a shit show because their immigration offices have been running at 150% since 2015.
I’m in some expat groups where I live in Germany and the Brits were pissed because they got a three year provisional residency permit even though they had been in Germany for 10+ years and had, like, kids and jobs and stuff.
Sucks to suck.
Getting a passport renewed for a French citizen in France is quite painful.
They've tried to streamline things but it's a mess.
It has to do with the machines required to take in biometric data.
It used to be much faster.
The French are brilliant at some admin if you are abroad, Crit A stickers and setting up auto toll accounts for a U.K. licensed car was ridiculously easy.
Anything to do with your Passport that requires a visit to the Consulate, good luck with that.
I’m one of the unfortunates who used to spend hours every week trying to book a slot at the Portuguese and French consulates for family members to get their passports renewed.
It’s actually easier to book an appointment in France and Portugal and travel their to renew passports and ID cards.
For the most part EU nationals applying for leave to remain here in the U.K. were dealt with reasonably well, far from perfect but generally it’s worked.
It’s been absolutely hit and miss in mainland Europe for the reciprocal agreements.
It’s painful but easier than trying to get an appointment at the Consulate here in London.
It was ok for the most part prior to Lockdown but very difficult at the moment.
