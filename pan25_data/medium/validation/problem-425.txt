You might want to check back on this comment in three months.
I read yesterday that the Russian army is preparing for an increase in air presence/support for their ground units, according to NATO intelligence.
Ukraine is the most contested air space on the globe right now.
There are Ukrainian and Russian air defense systems everywhereâ€”in addition to the tens of thousands MANPAD systems floating around on the battlefield.
And what prevented them from doing it when they actually had more aircraft, more pilots and Ukraine was less capable of defending?
They can plan for whatever they want.
Doesn't mean it's gonna actually do anything.
Succesfully at least.
If you have a modern anti-tank weapon and even minimal training in how to use it and drive a chariot vs me in the T-72b: you will very good odds.
The closest I have to a military background is a deer rifle: random chance means I might hit the right levers/buttons and so win in a fight, but odds are strongly against it.
I mean, you can fly pretty much anything that can carry bombs in uncontested airspace.
Doesn't matter how old, it'll do fine.
In Ukraine a B-52 would be shot down in 2 seconds.
