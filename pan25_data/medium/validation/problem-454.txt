heres the thing about Desantis, and its coming from someone who lives in Florida and sees his exchanges with the press.
He cant handle dissenting questions.
at all.
he gets red faced, and storms off the stage.
these videos of him "destroying" reporters questions?
they are heavily clipped and dont show the full exchanges.
All the media has to do to neuter desantis, is show all of the context for those exchanges.
And if he ever tries to debate anyone, even other republicans, he is going to get shredded on that stage.
whether the comments are policy substantive or not.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
