I never mentioned or argued in favor of "kick out every foreign invader from every country" and didn't need you to unnecessarily explain why that isnt feasible.
There is never an excuse or justification for genocide, and regardless of that I have never had an issue understanding that land belongs to the most recent conqueror.
You are trying to logically argue away on a broad scope what I thought I made clear were my personally held feelings.

Nobody should cave to those lunatics.
That's appeasement and it only makes things worse.
