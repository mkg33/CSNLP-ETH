I opened the radio a couple of days ago and they had an hour long program on Prussia.
I did not listen from the beginning so I can't say with certainty what it was supposed to be about but in a couple of minutes I learned from the host and the guest who's a professor of history that Frederick William I looked like a swine and behaved like an army sergeant.
That his son was aloof, looked like a dandy and did little more than playing the flute.
They mocked them and had lots of fun doing that.
If that were a PiS controlled station it would be no surprise but it was tokfm, owned by Agora.
A left leaning station that prides itself by being the most intellectual radio station in Poland.
Lots of Poles, even the more intellectual and open minded ones are pretty germanosceptic if not -phobic.
They are pretty ignorant as well.
I don't know a single person here who would be well versed in German history.
Right wing populism is nasty but there are ways to fight it.
Education is the best way, xenophobic people tend to be uneducated and poor.
The solution is to know and understand each other better.
Some schools have exchange programs, my former high school has participated in such a program with a school near Nuremberg for years and that's what should be encouraged more.
They go to Germany for a week or so and vice versa.
Do more of that but perhaps a semester long exchange?
Language or some other program immersion.
Same with universities.
Of course now that PiS is in charge it's impossible those miserable fucks even defunded the German language program for Silesians just out of spite.
It pissed me off so much i turned it off.
What a bunch of morons.
If they bothered to pick up "The rise and downfall of Prussia" they'd learn a thing or two about why Prussia, a humble, worthless land of sand, pines and bogs in the beginning, was so impressive became so powerful and influential and ultimately why it went down the path of self destruction.
Sad fact is that previous governments didn't care about the poor and those living outside of cities, but PiS does.
And it's a huge electorate.
Those people have no reason to stop supporting PiS because they were the first to take care for them.
