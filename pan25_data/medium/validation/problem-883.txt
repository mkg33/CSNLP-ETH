I mean the French people famously are known for quitely accepting massive changes to their social entitlements.

But the US is not France.
The US might make good use of some welfare system made for them, but in France (as well as Italy) the problem is the opposite: too many old people are about to retire, and there are not enough young people to pay for their pensions.
US and Europe have different problems, it's pointless to make comparisons.
France is about the same size as Texas.
It takes 24hours to drive across the state.
Now extrapolate that to all the other states and its a multi-day travel event just to get to the nation's capital.
We dont have strong enough unions to allow for that level of work stoppage.
Geographically it would be like every country that touches france showing up in Paris to protest, its on such a large scale its extremely difficult to get a critical mass for a sustained protest.
Just to be clear 87,000 out of 1,250,000+ people marched in Paris, the rest was "across France".
No one really has to go to a capital to protest, as seen with our pandemic response protests in the USA.
