I thought Russia was recruiting in Africa, turns out theyâ€™re holding African students studying in Russia hostage with threats of cancelling scholarships/debt trapping to force them to fight in a war.
Welcome to Russia where everyone not in the Kremlin is just a common expandable asset or fodder.
Everyone in the Kremlin should still stay away from windows but let's not go there..
Nah in mother Russia we push you from behind, you fall out window.
Then FSB shoot some cosplayers, I mean Ukrainian agents.
Glory to mother Russia where to rape a man in jail is not gay, but to be raped is gay and therefore illegal.
ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£.
That doesn't quite encompass how evil and stupid this war is.
Russia views humans as a resource to be expended, but resulting from low birth rates following the Soviet collapse.
Most developed nations are grappling with how to pay for the baby boom generation's need for geriatric care with populations that are plateauing.
This is a big problem for Germany and Japan, and China is facing a huge crisis caused by the One Child policy.
But those are populous countries constrained by natural resources.
China instituted the One Child policy out of fear of Malthusian overpopulation.
The one country in the world with plenty of space and natural resources for an expanding population is Russia, and they're throwing a generation of young men into the meat grinder.
For every man killed or crippled, around ten emigrate.
The conscripts come mostly from the poor, the talented and educated were the first to flee.
This is a staggering failure to utilize humans as a national resource, except on the timescale of a seventy year old leader's personal prestige.
