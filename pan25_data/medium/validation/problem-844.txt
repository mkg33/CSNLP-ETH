Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin are all pretty similar... All have fairly close state-wide margins and similar makeups in party affiliation between Dem/Rep/Ind.
but the impact of having oversight on drawing district maps is the key difference.
Michigan has an independent commission established via I believe a ballot initiative several years ago.
Pennsylvania has state supreme court oversight and ability to stop the state legislature (which was Republican controlled) and implement less egregiously gerrymandered maps.
However, Wisconsin has no check on the Republican-controlled state legislature.
Which is why they came within \1 SEAT\ of having 2/3 of each chamber filled by Republicans.
