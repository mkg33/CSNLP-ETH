They are really running scared in Michigan now that changes to the redistricting process have created fairer maps and allowed Democrats to take power.
They probably realize their best chance of winning there now is to cheat or gum up the democratic process.

The bigger challenge for the Democrats is complacency.
After they voted for Obama in 2008 in record numbers, they got complacent in 2010 which led to a complete shutdown of his agenda in the Congress thereafter.
All I am saying is that 2022 is not the last election, and I hope people will make it a habit to vote in all elections up and down the ballot including those that are mostly non-partisan.
Most people who don't follow politics seriously don't realize how critical it was that Dems flipped legislatures in places like Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania..
Not only does it change the calculations of SCOTUS in Moore v Harper, GOP know that if independent redistricting goes on the ballot in more states, their plans of winning the House just on the basis of gerrymandering won't be a sure shot like before..
