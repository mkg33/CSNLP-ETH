I can’t even imagine what these soldiers are going through.
One day you’re just walking home from the bank then they scoop you up and throw you on a bus.
Go to a Barricks get a change of clothes, try and find a sleeping bag and winter clothes for sale.
Then before you know it, its three days later you’re on the front fucking line.
No orders, no officers in the unit, they abandon you without food or water.
That’s fucked up shit Then the body “armor” they have is Airsoft.
No training on how to take cover from artillery so they get demolished.
They’ve got 60 year old equipment that they don’t even know how to use.
I’ve heard they have huge stock piles of drones but nobody’s trained on how to use them or any of the other equipment they have.
Ukraine needs to start shelling them with surrender papers more often.
Why would you fight for a country that does that to you.
With a war that you don’t even care about and will not benefit from in the future.
It really shows the regime's desperate grasp for power.
To force someone cold, starving, and with certainty of dying to stay and die is beyond comprehension to me.
I really feel for the soldiers who were forced to join and ended up there.
The commanders should be executed on the spot.
