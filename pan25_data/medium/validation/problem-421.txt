You do know there are a bunch of businesses in states like NY, DC, MD, CA, etc.
States that many people considered high tax states right?
What business will move to Oklahoma now after this?
I can't see any great economic opportunity being found in Oklahoma, as families tend to want to move to states with great schools.
Yeah, but what family will want to move here with schools being devoid of teachers and a climate that's hostile to things of science and art?
The religious climate tends to act as a push factor rather than as a pull factor here.
Elmore City was the inspiration of Footloose, and now Republicans seem dedicated to making the whole state be like Elmore City.
No billion dollar plus investments in either Florida or Oklahoma.
Maybe thier politicians should take a hint.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Yup.
The Christian nationalists basically admitted it during the campaign trail how education is a threat to them.
Look up Jarrin Jackson and Jackson Lahmeyer.
Both of them were frightened to death of reading anything outside the Bible.
They both were endorsed by Michael Flynn.
Yup.
That is Oklahoma for you.
There's all sorts of money available to start a church, but if you dare try to fund an arts program, you're a commie socialist, and they'll make you pay disproportionate for it.
Now, with one of the worst teacher shortages in the country, Ryan Walters wants to further exacerbate the problem.
Merit pay was what No Child Left Behind turned into, and it never works.
I had students who were Gifted and Talented that because they scored already at the top 1% of their grade couldn't raise any higher.
Then, when their scores didn't improve by the exact quota, because there wasn't much room left to improve, teacher pay was reduced for me.
It sucks.
Yup.
Prepare this to be the case all throughout Oklahoma.
Last year, I taught 110 students in 3 classes for months, and I was a SPED teacher.
Can you imagine the stress I went through?
It is easier to leave than stress yourself to death.
Yeah, most days, my kids' only meal would be what the school made for lunch and breakfast.
If they didn't eat that, they didn't have anything else to eat.
When you see how crappy American school food is, you're bound to weep over that.
To me, that is not the point of education.
The point of education is to learn and to acquire knowledge about the world—past, present, and future.
Education is meant to broaden horizons, not confine people to a specific parameter.
Oklahoma under Stitt will be behind a least developed country in terms of education if this continues.
We may already be there now, but we will most certainly get there soon enough thanks to Republicans.
Ryan Walters is a textbook case of the Stanley Milgram Experiment come to life, where obedience leads to great peril.
That also ignores the idea that school should be a free public good.
No one should have to pay for school.
It sets up a dishonest system when school is a cost.
Fair point.
However, I argue that everyone should know the eras of history, to understand different laws related to their job, as well as things that will benefit their metacognition (higher thinking).
I personally think education should be free on all levels, free college as well.
Everyone should be allowed the right to further themselves educationally.
There are benefits to learning various subjects, such as learning music improves various parts of the brain.
I don't devalue the trades at all.
We definitely need trade schools.
However, I personally think that there are benefits to learning across the board.
I personally don't see education as something that should ever "stop".
Jena Nelson literally showed up with a full-blown gameplan in the campaign, and Ryan Walters can't even do his own homework for his education proposal.
Walters is a broken record—if he can't say the words "woke", "gender ideology", or "woke, gender ideology", he is hopeless (and so is Oklahoma).
>A U.S. Department of Education review of Bridge the Gap and the private school voucher program, Stay in School, found that Oklahoma implemented few safeguards to prevent fraud or abuse.
Records obtained by Oklahoma Watch and The Frontier show the state placed no limits on what items families could purchase from vendors.
