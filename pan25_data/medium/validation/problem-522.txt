As for you second joke about machineguns Id say making civil rights only for rich white people who have connections to the local sheriff, donate to their political campaign , or give them political favors is pretty shitty.
Thats what NY did in the past and what Oregon is trying to do with this.
You remember the racist policies that targeted communities like stop and frisk?
Yeah those weren't exactly shinning moments by Bloomberg.
The NFA itself was a reaction to the Black Panthers in California.
So in a way maybe NFA items should be deregulated based on the deep racist roots of gun control.
(Machineguns shouldn't be free but I'd be fine with the registry opening back up).
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
