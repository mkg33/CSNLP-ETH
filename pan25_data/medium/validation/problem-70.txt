Yeah, that part of the world was basically controlled by Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Russia until WW1, where all 3 states lost badly and effectively collapsed.
So post war in Eastern Europe, no one was really in a position to enforce whatever treaties were being signed in the west about self determination and national borders and such, so it was basically a free for all.
Russia eventually came back to the scene once their civil war wrapped up in the early 1920s and absorbed some of the new states (like Ukraine), but the Russian invasion of Eastern Europe somewhat stabilised the region as everyone left recognised the threat the Soviets posed (and they'd be proven right in about 20 years).
My country of Bulgaria has seen this too, however, there are still plenty of people brainwashed by the historical propaganda unfortunately.
And I am not talking only about the older generation but quite a few of the young people seem to support Russia even though most of them travel, live, work and study in Europe.
