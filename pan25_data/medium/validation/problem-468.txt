You think it's also possible that Trump gets barred from running, he convinces a bunch of republicans that the system is rigged and tells people to not vote for those "traitors" and the Democrats get an actual landslide victory?
We are almost 100% in lockstep, but I hope all this happens PLUS Trump has to campaign from prison.
I'd even suggest allowing him to continue making videos so long as it's in his prison colours.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Based on how people turned against Trump when all the Republicans kind of turned on him months ago I would say only a tiny fraction of people would not vote at all.
Would be really funny though.
