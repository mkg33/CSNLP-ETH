Not sure why they’re all afraid of a most likely senile septuagenarian, but It’s great to see how much respect and power the Republicans are losing under their dear leaders reign!

It's time for Republicans to return to the platform and policies of the Eisenhower administration which built the middle class and technological might of the United States and taxed the war profiteers which today would be the defense industry profiteers and the information technology profiteers.
Stop listening to scum like Libertarian Reprobates who wants to destroy everything that makes the United States a properly regulated and law abiding nation for the benefit of all not just the benefit of a few at the top.
