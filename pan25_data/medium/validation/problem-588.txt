He's already shown weakness.
His second best military in the world has been shown to be a fraud, and every threat is and red line is crossed and they just whine and threaten more.
We went from "oh no, after Putin rolls on Ukraine is Poland next" to "that punk can't even feed his army or take out the poorest country in Europe."
Even his nuke threats are less fearsome because he's shown the world how hollowed out and poorly maintained his forces are.
I'm not saying he's not dangerous or in a bad spot, but he can leave, say he denazified Ukraine and shoot any Russian who says boo.
He wants you to think he's the cornered rat, but that's Ukraine.
He can go back home, they can't.
Putin himself mused, "What good is the world without Russia in it?"
"We'll all go to heaven", yawp Putin's toadies on national TV.
They have repeatedly tried to normalize the idea that National Suicide / unleashing Armageddon is preferable to defeat.
I'm still on the fence as to whether this is for domestic or international consumption.
It seems to me that the Putin regime has chosen the North Korean approach of negotiation by provocation, with bellicose actions to underline the rhetoric.
The problem for Putin is that no one takes North Korea's outlandish, apocalyptic threats seriously anymore.
