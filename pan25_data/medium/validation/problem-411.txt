Islamic regime is using chloride and zinc gas against inocent Iranian people, this is such a war crime that is happening in Iran.
Iranian people are in a real revolution , they need a regime change, this is not a simple protest, Iranian regime has to go.
Just imagine what they'll do to their people and neighbors if they have weapons of mass destruction and do not fear the west.
Israel is the only western country who does something.
Maybe join it instead of finding ways to trash on it.
I find it all extremely hilarious.
A fanatic violent regime is trying to be the new North Korea, and all redditors do is discuss what Israel did or did not do, instead of trying to stop it.
Israel is a tiny irrelevant country.
Regardless of what you think about them their population with the Palestinian population is such a small part of world suffering I don't understand why it even gets news.
Maybe due to any unwarranted suffering is a cause of alarm?
If there was a serial killer on the loose, then they probably shouldn't n't make the news due to killing a few people, yeah?
Maybe the same should not be extended to serial killer governments or dictatorships?
They are funding terrorists all over the world and are supplying Russia with weapons to murder Ukrainians, a peaceful country who did nothing to them.
This is what they do WITHOUT weapons of mass destruction.
Do you not understand what will happen if they get that power?
You can stop a country from getting nukes, you cannot stop a country which already has them.
Which is the entire point of my comment.
First, Israel is not a massive threat to it's neighbors.
It factually gave back more land mass than it's entire size in exchange for peace with it's neighbors.
So your comment is very wrong.
Those Jews were mostly secular at that point.
Not religious fanatics as your comment makes them out to be.
Second, whatever issues you have with Israel and Palestinians has nothing to do to Iran's nuke problems, but I can discuss it further if you want to.
Maybe one day we can have a discussion about some aspect of middle eastern politics without derailing every unrelated conversation to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has absolutely nothing to do with this thread.
The Jewish religion does not spread like Christianity or Islam, it got to so many parts of the world by displacing population against their will.
First, the Jews in the entire world have always had a strong connection to Israel.
They kept mentioning it and talk about it daily and it is a part of all their customs etc.
The only reason Jewish people even lived abroad and across of Europe and the middle east is that they were expelled from Israel in the first place.
Second, this land was not controlled by Palestinians, it was controlled by British who promised this land to 2 different people who wanted a new identity for themselves.
The Jews because they were constantly persecuted around the world (Much like the black communities in the US after slavery was ended, but they still suffered from extreme segregation from white society), and the Arabs living in Palestine because they wanted a new identity for themselves after the failed venture which was the vast Islamic empire, denied by the British despite promises to the Arab population.
If Israel was limiting access to water (Or food) the Palestinian population would not have multiplied as much as it does.
So please, let's leave the exaggerated ridiculous claims out of it.
So let me get this straight, it's the US and Israel who are the monsters and a danger to the free world, yes?
Let's establish this one simple fact, if Israel wanted to destroy all Palestinians, there would be none left here since 1948, when they lost the geocidal war they declared on us together with 7 other Arab states, instead of accepting the UN proposal and get a country of their own.
We could have peace right then and there with 2 countries living side by side.
"We trust Israel to do the hard and right thing for us while we sit on our asses and try to point out every little thing it does wrong".
I would very much love to see an official stance of all western countries publicly declaring that Israel should do whatever it takes to stop Iran from having nukes without any diplomatic consequences from them.
What annoys me is seeing countless of comments complaining about Israel, which is the only country currently seriously operating to stop this huge potential atrocity from happening.
But I guess if you feel that huge holocausts are not your fight and your personal problems matter more, I can understand.
Still, I really disagree with you.
I am from Israel and we have huge problems of our own.
Yet it pains me greatly to read about what goes on in North Korea and knowing me or my country cannot help in pretty much any way shape or form since they already have their WMDs.
In Javanrud, Piranshahr, etc., they are using war bullets, hexachloroethane gas (causes serious disorders in the nervous system) and other war weapons against the protesters.
Let us be the voice of the Kurdish people.
In Joanrud, they are shooting at houses and people with caliber 50 (belonging to semi-heavy war machine guns that can pass through a 20 cm wall), let's be the voice of Jovanrud.
The protesting people in Javanrud have been attacked with war bullets by the repressive forces of the Islamic Republic, the hospitals of Javanrud and Piranshahr are facing a shortage of blood, and the forces of the Islamic Republic do not allow blood shipments to enter Javanrud, the Islamic Republic is carrying out a genocide in Kurdistan.
The repressive forces of the Islamic Republic in Kurdistan have attacked the protesters with doshka weapons and other weapons of war, such as sniper rifles, and are genocidaling Kurdistan citizens, be the voice of Kurdistan.
The Islamic Republic is carrying out a genocide in Javanrud, the repressive forces of the Islamic Republic do not allow blood shipments to enter Javanrud, they use war weapons against the protesters, they have poisoned the drinking water, and recently they used hexachloroethane gas, which is the gas that caused severe disturbances.
In the nervous system, it can be used against protesters, this is a genocide, be the voice of Javanrud and Kurdistan.
Hospitals in Javanroud are faced with a shortage of blood, but the repressive forces do not allow blood shipments to enter the Kurdish cities of Kurdistan, this is a genocide in Iran that was carried out by the Islamic Republic, be the voice of Kurdistan and Javanroud.
The gas used in Javanrud is hexachloroethane, a gas that is probably a nerve agent that temporarily disrupts the activity of the central nervous system.
After firing, a two-step reaction takes place in the capsule where chlorine combines with zinc metal to form chloride, a pale green gas.
The repressive forces of the Islamic Republic in Javanrud shoot the protesters with war bullets and kidnap those who are injured, let us be the voice of Kurdistan.
In the cities of Kurdistan, the forces of the Islamic Republic shoot protesters, kill them, and now the hospitals are faced with a shortage of blood, but the repressive forces do not allow blood shipments to enter the city, a war crime and genocide is on the verge of happening in Kurdistan.
Be their voice.
