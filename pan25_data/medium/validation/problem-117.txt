Theres this desire from many people and the media to see the Republican party come out once and for all denounce Trump and his maga extremists.
I think we all need to accept the fact that the Republican party IS the Maga extremists and we will never get that full separation.
They need to be removed from anything resembling power and allow something new to come out of all of this.
I really don't see any other way.
The GoP is dead.
