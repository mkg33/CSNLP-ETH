Is there a likelihood that Pelosi's portfolio - or her husband's portfolio has benefitted from information that she had access to as a Congresswoman?
I just don’t know why I’m being downvoted for stating the obvious.
It’s not even a slight against her.
Yeah.
You are talking about her "conveniently" selling stocks before "investigation" in a thread about her selling stocks.
You implying that there's a connection was as subtle as a brick through a window.

Please if you have any questions or concerns.
What conversations have you observed in recent memory about the topic?
Hmm?
and if she benefitted from insider information, she should be a part of the conversation.
She's being "targeted" (HA!)
because of her longevity in Congress, her portfolio's apparent and obvious growth, and her failure to do anything about the issue while she was in charge.
Your complaint about "both sides" is remarkably short-sighted and obfuscates the larger issue: that everyone in Congress who has benefitted from information not available to the public is the problem - regardless of the side of the aisle they sit on.
