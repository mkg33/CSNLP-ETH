Having grown up in the South, worked blue collar jobs and consumed countless hours of conservative and religious media, my anecdotal judgment is that these people are incredibly insecure.
They only understand the world and the things in the world within their tiny boundaries: their local high school, township, county and maybe the next big city over.
Their world is so incredibly small and they are so incurious and somewhat afraid of anything outside of it that they need to justify their lack of understanding as somehow morally defensible.
They do this by grounding their beliefs and knowledge in tradition, religion and folk wisdom.
They have a vague awareness that the world is more complicated than they can understand and feel very small when comfronted with that realization.
God is their hidey-hole to duck into when confronted by difficult scientific questions.
Difficult socio-political issues push them into a cave where only vague analogies comparing features of their small lives to vastly more complex and nuanced problems exist.
They feel personally attacked when someone with a University education speaks around them.
They take any chance they can to remind them of their age or inexperience in skills they seem important.
They put down education and supplant it with their own experience as being more valuable than the "theoretical brainwashing" they think happens in academia.
They have to because that difference in education isn't a difference to them.
It's a value statement: if the other person understands more, they must be "better" and no one wants to feel "worse" than some one else.
At the root of the average conservative is only insecurity and a thin shield to protect their ego from an absolute threat-level-toddler temper tantrum if it were to break.
They have no ability to adapt, no patience to derive understanding, no empathy to share experiences.
They can only deny, deflect and project.
They vote for those that do the same.
They don't care about policy as long as the policies don't hurt them directly.
To them, they understand that only their small bubble exists and anyone outside of it who might be doing things in any way different should change to their way of doing things because it's the best isn't it?
If it wasn't, maybe they'd have to think more, and thinking reminds them of how ill-equipped they are to do it.
