I lived there for a year with my fiance who is from there.
We were stuck there for a year during the pandemic.
Tokayev took power during this time.
Please understand this is a young country with independence in 1991!
By far this was the best candidate and he in general is well liked by the people.
Incumbents all have a good chance and as a new country this voting isn't a normal thing for most people or the culture.
You do however have a burgeoning younger generation who already know him and not much else.
He's been dismantling the legacy of the old dictator.
Passed a law so family of the president cannot hold key power positions such as Minister of Defense etc.
He also renamed the capital city back to it's original name after the previous dictator changed it to his own name a few years back.
Heâ€™s relatively new to power so time will tell if he wears out his welcome, but hopefully he sets Kazakhstan on the right path - it should be a bigger player on the world stage than it currently is.
So yeah, the election was legit, fair and people did actually vote for him... because he was the only real option.
A surprise election is announced a few months before the event.
The list of candidates is finalized like a few weeks before the election date.
There are laws that media outlets need to follow.
Some news agencies and TV channels are state sponsored.
They are definitely heavily censored and are blindly pro-government.
We still have access to most online resources, but most popular porn sites are blocked, VPN providers are blocked, some news sites are blocked, some anti government sites are blocked.
But we still have access to other sources of information, foreign TV channels, online news websites etc.
So I guess he does control some media, but to a limited extent?
