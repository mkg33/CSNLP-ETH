Ridiculous.
There is a Jewish lobby.
AIPAC is a Jewish lobby.
There's a drug industry lobby called PHRMA.
K Street in DC is filled with lobbyists of every imaginable and some unimaginable causes.
The problem arises when lobbyists use illegal methods or otherwise violate the law (and I am not saying the Jewish lobby has done so).
The problem with the "Jewish lobby" is not that they exist or that they are strong.
The problem is that while supporting some causes that advance the benefit of the Jewish people, they also support abusive and illegal practices by the Israeli government.
It is OK to hate a Jewish politician or government.
But it's not OK to hate them just because they are Jewish.
Only by their acts may they be judged.
Yeah I mean most people denounce any other kind of lobby.
I would only say this is an appropriate term to use, however, if there is a coherent body that often pursues a consistent goal or agenda.
Miloon Kothari, one of three members of the UNHRC’s Commission of Inquiry on Israel, had said in a public interview that social media was largely controlled by the “Jewish lobby.”.
America and Europe, one of them subjugated by the Jewish Lobby, and the other by the sense of guilt about the Holocaust remain on the sidelines.”.
