I’m all for being critical and condescending when an aggressor is being stupid, but saying us Westerners also aren’t about immediate gratification, well….
Going through the process of selling the gun and buying the vodka is way more time consuming and a pain so the armed robbery is the instant gratification option.
It has the same start point and end point but less steps.
Judging by how these things tend to go in other countries... not much.
Once the people decide that violent strong-man tactics are what brings down crime, they are unlikely to change their mind about it, even when it's quite obviously not working.
For those who do not know, Russia had one of the highest murder rates on the planet back in the 1990s and early 2000s, at one point it had a higher murder rate than Brazil.
The declining murder rate, alongside the Russian victory in Chechnya and the economic boom of the 2000s boosted Vladimir Putin's popularity among the Russian people and I do wonder how this crime explosion will impact Vladimir Putin's image in Russia.
