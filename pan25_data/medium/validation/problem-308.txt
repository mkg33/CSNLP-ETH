Was that an actual coup?
No one but redditors seem to call it that.
I tried to find any news at the time call it that.
It’s before my political watching life so I don’t know the details.
I’m not defending it, I’m sure some shady shit happened, I just don’t believe it was ever referred to as a coup.
