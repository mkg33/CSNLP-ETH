I got so many republican flyers telling me crime was up because democrats defunded the police here.
Crime isn't up and no one defunded police in this state.
It often works with your base to get them motivated to vote.
The problem for the Republicans is there were even more people motivated to vote against them for some reason.
I wonder what it could be?
It's weird because that's not a threat that worries republicans.
The ones who would fall for it don't live in cities, and it doesn't threaten them, some might even gleefully laugh at the idea that we get what we deserve for out liberal policies.
But it's not something that actively worries them.
It's one of their signature plays.
Talk about crime as a means to instill fear, then paint yourself as the solution to the said crime issue.
Another topic they do this same thing with is the economy.
