But what created that pro conservative sentiment in the first place?
A large part of it is thanks to American Policy towards Cuba as well as the history of how the richest of Cubans fled to Florida after the Castro regime seized most of their wealth, and they were not having any of it (many of us would be upset too).
One clear example is how Cubans are treated very differently from any other immigrant block thanks to the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966 which still remains in force.
"The law applies to any native or citizen of Cuba who has been inspected and admitted or paroled into the United States after January 1, 1959 and has been physically present for at least one year, and is admissible to the United States as a permanent resident."
No other immigrant block in the world get this privilege, only Cubans do.
The CAA should be revoked, but Republicans would never consider that as an option since they know this is a very popular law with Cuban migrants (can you blame them for wanting special treatment?
), and without it, Cubans would have one less big reason to vote red.
The US had around 250,000 refugees from Venezuela apply or cross the border seeking asylum in 2021 and only took around 20k permanently.
