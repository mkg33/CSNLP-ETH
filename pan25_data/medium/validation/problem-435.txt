Broom handle and strict gay laws is a good recipe to keep leverage on most folks.
It’s actually very commonly used to keep loyalty in Russian army and military in general.
They say “gay is bad, don’t you let us tell everyone you were forced to be the bottom”.
They take pictures during and bam, loyalty till death.
Shame is a social construct.
I hope at some point gay people will tell them that people in a dominant position in male intercourse are still gay if they enjoy it.
It’s probably something that can break Russian society.
Hah see that’s what I mean.
Last time I checked, the soldier has to show up for patrol, proverbially, and the soldier doesn’t show up out of genuine disgust, when it should be patrolling for another army.
If that soldier is in the wrong trench, per se, it’s because he went there on purpose IMO!
Never understood the whole 'being a bottom is more gay' argument lol.
You're still gay af if you're banging a dudes ass, Russian military in shambles.
According to the nefarious stereotype, it's not "gay" if enjoyment comes purely from abusing a weaker guy who is forced to act as a temporary replacement for "a girl", and you feel genuine disgust for him being a man, while sexually dominating him.
It's some broken psyche shit.
