"So, my number: 25.
It wasn't a number that gave me any satisfaction.
But neither was it a number that made me feel ashamed,".
To be honest I don’t have too strong an opinion on the overall situation, but the context of those sentences is really important.
It has definitely been deliberately taken out of context for a sound bite to make him look bad.
Harry's book sounds like the story of the "poor millionaire", too taken by his victim complex to realize how fortunate he is.
It’s actually a thoughtful and insightful look into soldiering, and even the chess pieces comment doesn’t sound too bad in situ - he’s in the middle of describing a common and almost necessary detachment, which they are trained to do because if you view targets as people, there’s no way you could kill them.
Finally, the book reads like the ravings of an unstable person who suffers from a victim complex compounded by unresolved Mommy issues.
First of all, the book was written by a , not by Harry.
It is easy to tell because the writer sounds more clever than Harry himself sounds in interviews.
Second, the entire book is an exercise on self-pity.
The rich boy born with a golden spoon in his mouth with a life of ease in front of him would suddenly be the victim of an elaborate plot to get him.
At one point, while looking at their credit card statement, readers are overwhelmed with an envy to puke.
Third, we learn that Harry is entirely devoted to two women and hates a third.
Harry is madly in love with Megan, to the point of being unable to see fault in her.
Similarly, he idolizes his late mother Diana, again unable to see any fault in her character, he instead admires her as perfect in every way, dismissing the numerous and documented affairs (over 10) Diana had while married to Charles and the fact that she never understood her role as a supporting act for the Crown.
The main surprise of the book is that Harry does not lob grenades at the other Royals, save Camila, as he clearly hints that they are all victims of a conspiracy put together by Camila.
The woman he hates is Camila and his hate knows no bounds.
Despite evidence that Camila never really wanted to be Queen, that she was happy being the girlfriend of Charles and that it is Charles who pushed Camila into a civil wedding, Harry depicts her as a the mastermind behind the plot to get Diana and him.
The description sounds so unreal that it becomes reminiscent of the character of Doctor Evil in the Austin Powers movie series.
When you put down the book, your only thought is "give me only half of what Harry has and I would have a happy life".
To be blunt about it, a lot of people lose their mothers, sometimes to crime, sometimes to diseases, sometimes to suicide...
But few of them would suffer from a victim complex as big as Harry's.
BDA (Battle Damage Assessment).
Video of engagements, especially from airstrikes, gets reviewed and reported.
EKIA (Enemy Killed In Action), wounded, captured, and High Valued Targets gets reported.
Quantity of munitions and equipment used and destroyed also gets reported.
All this information and more is accountable information.
It also helps to ensure that the ROE's (Rules Of Engagement) were followed.
War is about the numbers.
Unfortunately, this includes human lives.
With all this said, I think Harry should have kept that information amongst himself and the people he can trust.
