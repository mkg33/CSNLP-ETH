When I see Republicans advocating for real issues like feeding, housing, and providing healthcare for ALL children then, maybe, I'll start believing they actually give a damn about the health and safety of children.
If they actually cared about children they would’ve implemented common sense gun laws instead of watching said kids get murdered in their first grade classrooms.
Anyone else remember how the Republicons were FREAKING OUT about big government getting involved in healthcare via Obamacare?
Now they are literally stripping people of their right to healthcare.
They don’t care about your rights.
