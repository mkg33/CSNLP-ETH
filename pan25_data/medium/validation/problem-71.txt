We only use "sorry" to people that we a minor grievance with that is not worth fighting over (or if we do something bad that we are sorry we did.)
If you do something bad but we do not say sorry then that's your cue to be afraid of the Canadian.
That cold silent expression on the Canadian's face is the Canadian pondering how many ways they can bring a ungodly wrath from on high upon your unworthy head.
Canada did not participate in the Iraq war!
Really?
Initially no but later Canada did send troops, frigates and destroyers in Iraq.
Well, Canada and Cuba relationships can be an exception.
Cuban missile Crisis notably.
Under Trudeau Sr. Canada was one of if not THE first western country to form relations with Communist China.
Canada despite the US embargo on Cuba, was personal friends with Castro and made many visits to Cuba as well as friendly relations between the two country.
In 2003, PM Jean Chretien did not participate in the Iraq War despite pressure from Washinon.
Need I go on?
The exception to this are the Mounties.
The Mounties won't tell you they're sorry even when they are.
