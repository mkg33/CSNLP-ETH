Assange is a narcissistic bag of dicks.
It was never about the truth or releasing everything that came across his desk.
He released documents in a strategic, self-serving way to harm people he considered his enemies and enhance his own image.
He strategically damaged the United States and her allies, including the country of his citizenship, and assisted enemies both foreign and domestic.
I'd be fine with freeing assange if he admits that he provided software for the purpose of hacking a U.S. government system at the direction of the Russian GRU and abused trust placed in him to disseminate information at specific times for the purpose of an outcome he wanted.
If he reveals their actions and influence and cooperates it's a net positive for the public interest and bolsters people against misinformation.
I wouldn't be a fan of incarceration purely to punish if he cooperates and tells the truth.
I really doubt he would be cooperating on anything.
I think that works on people in it for the money, not people who have a martyr complex and are focused on one ideological enemy.
