I was indulging in my lifelong hobby of nocturnal angling at my local canal when I was caught short and headed for the public conveniences at the nearby park.
On entering the conveniences I slipped on the wet floor, ended up in an occupied cubicle and a part of my body inadvertently entered that of the occupant.
I removed it immediately of course but slipped again and it went back in.
This act repeated itself several times with increasing ferocity until I had an unfortunate emission at which point the Police officer came in.
He discovered us both drenched in my emissions and jumped to the wrong conclusion, which was that it was an act of adult unpleasantness between consenting males.
He arrested us both but I have made my position clear and as far as I'm concerned that is the end of the matter.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
