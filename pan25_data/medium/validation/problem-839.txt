Yeah, but a lot of that was due to draconian laws that rocketed us to the 1 country in the world for prisoners, both in absolute numbers and per capita.
Shoving shitloads of people into prisons does reduce blue collar crime.
It does.
It's just morally outrageous.
If it's combined with an increasing tolerance for white collar crime, it's also a bad-faith exercise in "solving" the wrong problem.
You progressively make huge swaths of the country shittier, which fights against your ostensible goal of reducing blue-collar crime.
Then, anybody who tries to rectify the monstrous injustices of the race to incarcerate gets whammied by spikes in crime.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
