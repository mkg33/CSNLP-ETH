Unlike Donald Trump the current government didn't storm the parliament, they won in a fair election.
Israel like the UK doesn't have a constitution, like the UK its parliament was sovereign until the courts suddenly decided they can block the legislature's laws.
Just costs Israel all its institutional credibility on the world stage and its own domestic intelligentsia (and probably mystically-inclined orthodox Jews who have citizenship elsewhere as well...they know this fascist about-face is not worth the price the conventional orthodox parties want to pay [regarding military service exemptions]).
This has nothing to do with Netanyahu's trial, his trial has already started and the judges in that trial will not change because of this reform.
Like i said, if having a sovereign parliament makes Israel lose all credibility on the world stage then the UK should have zero credibility as well seeing how the UK has no constitution and parliament can make any law it wants.
I don't get riled up about reddits opinion about Israel for the most part as its users are typically reactionary, fickle, and easily swayed.
This is however a crossroads moment for us.
The next few years will determine the next 50.
For the sake of everyone involved, Israeli, Palestinian, and otherwise, Bibi has got to go (hopefully to jail).
Israel like the UK doesn't have a constitution, like the UK its parliament was sovereign, until the courts suddenly decided they can block the legislature's laws.
Its well within the right of the Israeli Parliament to return sovereignty to themselves, if that makes Israel not democratic then the UK isn't a democracy either.
