The fact that Liz Cheney is considered a “moderate” Republican tells us everything we need to know.
I am glad she finally took a stand against Trump on the J6 Committee.
And, I think she did that well.
Up till that point, she was 100% on board the Republican shit show and is at least partly responsible for creating Trump.
She is a hard right political figure that is nowhere near “moderate.” She only looks “moderate” because most of the Republican Party is based in extreme right fascism.
