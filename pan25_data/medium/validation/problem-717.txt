I think Russia is in a similar situation as Germany in 1943, before or after Kursk... On paper it's still strong (in numbers German army peaked in 1943), but its strategy has failed, its best troops have been eliminated, it has lost the momentum, it can't sue for peace because of the stubbornness of the leader, its increasing difficulties are hidden by even more hostile rhetorics, it has problems with logistics etc.
The only thing missing are the bombings of the home front.
Just like the prelude for the war was similar to events in 1938.
The leader ranting up about external threats, historical borders and the nation's natural right to subjugate smaller nations that are not worthy of their own country...
Morale in the Russian military is crushingly low at this point.
They've retreated in the south west and in the north east, and in the eastern donbas assaults, they've run into a wall for months.
Thousands dying for a few meters here and there borderline WW1 levels of movement.
But most of all, now the country sees the Russian army retreating, not once, but twice.
And it will happen again.
