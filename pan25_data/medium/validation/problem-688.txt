Need to liberalize zoning and ensure that there are enough construction workers in the influx.
Immigration isn’t an issue unless there are inherent shortages.
I’m pro immigration (being from an immigrant family myself).
However I fail to see the logic in this.
The country is falling apart.
There’s zero big ideas for united us (high speed rail anyone?
Butler?).
There’s nowhere to live that has housing costs in line with average wages.
Our health care system is falling apart.
110% of the opposition is due to the shortage of housing.
Liberalize permitting and bring in some unskilled construction workers from Venezuela or Haiti and watch Canada become a superpower.
Unless this is targeted, thoughtful immigration, bringing people in who can fill positions, and a huge push to expedite infrastructure and housing, this will simply add to the already huge underclass of people in this country.
The housing is mainly due to zoning making it hard to build at scale, and favoring rich and educated people over construction workers (unless there are issues with the workers’ children being poorly educated, there’s no reason to exclude them in a country with so much fresh water and land).
