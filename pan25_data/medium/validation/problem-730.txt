I don’t think so.
I saw one comment saying it was an F22 but honestly those things are so expensive to run it would be a waste.
I would assume they used either an F-16 or F-15 with a kinetic missile.
Idk, I personally didn’t hear anything about that, for me that wouldn’t make sense because it’s just a balloon and F-22s need something like 17 man hours of maintenance for every hour of flight or some shit but it’s possible.
If they did then I guess they could’ve used them.
Well if anything it's a good real-life training exercise and gives an excuse to use the tech we spend billions on.
22s operational sustained altitude is 65k feet, short flight altitude is likely closer to 75k-85k feet.
The military literally does not care about cost of maintenance.
They need to be flown or the maintenance ironically becomes astronomically more expensive over time.
Yes the balloon was in the stratosphere which the low stratosphere all US fighter jets could reach.
If it was in the high stratosphere (it wasn’t) I don’t think any plane could although I’m not sure we know the true flight ceiling of the F-22, when I googled it I got answers around 50-60k feet which is where the F-15 and 16 both fly.
