On 30 August 2021, the international coalition of states combatting the Taliban completed its withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Seven days later, the Taliban raised its flag over Kabul, declaring itself the government of the new Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.
Today, the Taliban controls more Afghan territory and is far better armed, than before the war.
Its oppression of minorities, women, and the Afghan population at large, is as brutal as ever.
The National Resistance Front of Afghanistan is waging a determined guerrilla war against the Taliban.
Its 4'000 battle-hardened troops are concentrated in the north, and have spread from Panjshir and Baghlan into four additional provinces.
However, while the international community has offered the Resistance much praise, it has advanced no material aid.
Most countries that spent the previous twenty years fighting the Taliban are still nursing their wounds, after losing thousands of troops and trillions of dollars.
Does the Resistance have any hope of defeating the Taliban?
Can it inflict sufficient damage to force the Taliban into genuine peace talks?
What would it take to persuade the international community to help the people of Afghanistan complete the mission to free themselves from the Taliban?

That's subjective AF.
No country is going to spend billions to gain a relatively small net profit to pad the EBITDA for their country's tax statement.

Are the people of Afghanistan willing to support the resistance?
Are they willing to rule for themselves when the country is taken back?
Is there some sort of figurehead or representative of this Resistance to which the people can rally to?
Like a beacon of hope who can inspire the people that there is a future if they change the current government?
