Fani Willis (Fulton DA) hinted at a , but I could see it being pushed back another a month or two.
But, there aren't a lot of stones left to uncover in that one - The grand jury has basically exhausted their depositional phase, having received testimony from , including the governor, AG, secretary of state, senators, reps, and more.
DOJ/Special prosecutor are waiting for the 11th circuit to resolve the documents appeal as a minimum, which could happen as early as this week.
Earlier reporting suggested people familiar with the investigation weren't expecting an indictment before the end of the year, but we are much more in the dark with this one.
Trump's liaison to the National Archives was , which is strong sign that the case is speeding up.
We all wanted to see an indictment yesterday or 6 years ago, but these are literally the highest profile investigations in American history, and even simple investigations can take years to resolve.
I swear all these threads do is sow discontent in the Biden Admin/Justice Dept for following the legal process as it should.
Everyone here seems to want this to play like a legal thriller, not like an actual investigation.
These are moving fast, all things considered in our glacial legal system.
Trump will 100% get indicted.
Unfortunately, that's only the beginning.
A trial could extend for years to come, and it's still possible he would never be incarcerated or even convicted.
There's a long ways to go in any scenario.
Like the “why subpoena him if you know he won’t appear!” Comments - if you don’t do it they can delay, or worse push for a mistrial.
You don’t get to skip steps or admit circumstantial evidence or assumptions because the other side didn’t play fair.
The NYAG said they reviewed millions of documents in their case, that doesn’t happen over night.
For a counter example, was arrested within 4 days of the NSA/FBI finding out about her leak, and charged within 10 days.
She sat in jail without bail for over a year.
That's what happened with Reality Winner.
Arrested within 4 days of the FBI/NSA finding out about the leak.
Charged within 10 days.
Denied bail, sat in jail for over a year until convicted.
Is like saying we should admit spectral evidence.
There’s no place for that in the legal process.
I’d rather have a thorough investigation than rush it and end up with Trump acquitted.
You have to remember how much of this case will have zero precedent, and with our system that relies on stare decisis that means the case will need to be built perfectly.
> The Intercept sent copies of the documents to the NSA on May 30 to confirm their veracity, and the NSA notified the FBI...On June 3, the FBI obtained a warrant to search Winner's electronic devices, and she was arrested....On June 8, 2017, she pleaded not guilty to a charge of "willful retention and transmission of national defense information", and was denied bail.
Prosecutors alleged she may have been involved in other leaks of classified information, and might try to flee the country if released.
Just because the SCOTUS decided to ignore precedent on some of their rulings doesn’t change the way the system functions.
Our Justice system is Common Law which relies heavily on precedent, and the judges to make rulings based on heavily on precedent.
There is room for new interpretation, but the backbone still is precedent, which there is very little of here.
Yeah, and I get that people are tired of seeing unaccountability of this man for years on end, and that our broken justice system does not treat people evenly whatsoever - but at the same time: It's impossible to stress how important this is.
If Trump doesn't get indicted or convicted, that could signal the collapse of America's legal and political systems.
It will mark an era American history.
At the same time, I think people direct their frustration in the wrong places.
The legal system is why this is frustrating - the lenh of investigations, of building a case, of trials, judges, juries, of public/political perception, the way in which wealth, power, and resources favors those over others.
There is zero room for error, and prosecutors have to dot every i and cross every t before they even think about bringing charges.
But it isn't the prosecutors that want nothing more than to see Trump behind bars.
So many people chalk this up as incompetence of career officials at the DOJ, as if they could just hit a button and put Trump behind bars, and are choosing not to - rather than the system itself that they have to work within.
We're a nation where Bannon was indicted over a year ago, sentenced and convicted unanimously by a jury, and he's still a free man pending appeal.
Part of changing that system is making sure someone like a former President does face accountability, and elimitinating any possibility that he doesn't.
But just think about how much it hurts the prosecution if his crime isn't even serious enough to arrest him over it: "Your Honor, Trumps crimes are so serious, so damaging to our national security, that we...let him stay a free man, so he could keep doing it...".
Then they either get denied bail or not.
That's up to the judge.
But it shows that the prosecution is serious at least.
Right, but we aren't.
We're a nation where it takes 2 years from Watergate to even consider charging Nixon, after which a President simply pardons him and he never sees accountability.
She was arrested for mere suspicion of being the leaker, and was denied bail twice.
She was arrested within four days of the NSA/FBI finding out about the leak.
She was charged within 10.
Our system is awful, and it needs to change.
But I can't solely fault an entity like a DOJ right now.
They are working within it pretty well and moving reasonably fast, all things considered.
They should have arrested him immediately.
You don't need ANY sort of airtight case for an immediate arrest.
You can just arrest people.
This isn't a financial crime.
It's stealing top secret documents.
Look at the arrest of for a real comparison.
Ah, the old "you can't arrest someone if he's still committing crimes" argument.
You see the obvious flaw in that system, right?
Those are separate cases, they don't have to work together, they don't have to worry about stepping on toes.
I don't get why you think he'd be able to blab while locked up.
He would have limited access to anyone, unlike at Mar a Lago, and presumably he'd still be monitored by Secret Service while imprisoned.

Trump never had the authority to declassify documents related to nuclear secrets, definitely doesn't have any authority to declassify anything since Biden was sworn in, and it is beyond question that the documents are classified, because neither Trump nor anyone else declassified them.
Whether any document is classified is cut and dry, and only idiots and liars believe Trump could have secretly "declassified them by thinking about it".
Trump also doesn't have to share the documents with anyone for it to be a crime, as multiple experts have attested.
You seem to think that every Trump crime must be lumped into one giant monolithic investigation, and that nothing can be done until every crime is fully investigated.
That's not how prosecutions works, obviously, because then a criminal could simply keep committing more crimes and be untouchable forever.
These are all just ridiculous excuses for political cowardice.
People pushing these ideas are hoping Trump gets off Scot free.
Period.
Whether they are Trump supporters or apologists for Centrist Dem weaklings, I don't know.
I remember right after 1/6 so many comments here trying to say the Dems were in on it because they didn’t “push for an open, publicly televised investigation and trial” and that they were clearly doing nothing because articles of.
I took constitutional law as an elective in HS and Intro Law as a requirement in college.
The amount of incorrect stuff I hear people say about the legal system and appeals process just from those two courses is insane.
Biggest one- and said wayyy too often on advice threads Reddit- “if you sign it, you’re screwed.” Illegal clauses are unenforceable, and there will almost always be a clause in contracts that if one is defined as illegal, the rest stands.
Landlords and business often try to skate as close to the line as possible or even bully people into thinking they can enforce something, so if something smells fishy, it might be worth having someone with knowledge take a look at.
Plenty of lawyers will advise on landlord/tenant pro bono (won’t draft anything or represent you, but will advise you to seek legal counsel if you have a case) so it’s worth seeking out.
Things like leases are very content controlled, so your LL can’t sneak something unfair in legally.
