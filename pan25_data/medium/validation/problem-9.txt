During the 00’s it was liberals and feminists (I identify as both) who promoted the misuse and misapplication of “trafficking” during a windfall of private and government funding to build an anti-trafficking movement that has helped few victims relative to the largesse of funds these networks accessed.
I learned this while helping a black immigrant woman escape a violent pimp who was actually violating the trafficking laws as they were written.
Shelters didn’t want to house her because she had a pimp and used drugs.
She didn’t fit the narrative they were seeking.
When the image is suburban English speaking teen girls, the $$$ flows.
The truly vulnerable are liabilities.

This move by republicans in Idaho is a natural, despite unintended, extension of that system.
This is a real life example of why many of us opposed misuse of the term “trafficking” and programs that focused on sex trafficking and ignored general labor trafficking.
Sex trafficking narratives raise pulses and have liberal women emptying their purses to finance cops and NGO directors while poverty is ignored and the vulnerable remain without resources.
“Ideal” victims were spotlighted while undesirables were denied services.
A liberal/feminist spouting complete Republican talking points, yeah sure.
It's the liberals fault Republicans are behaving so poorly It's all their fault Look what we made them do!

Please if you have any questions or concerns.
What goes around comes around.
Misapplication of trafficking applied to abortion access is infuriating, but not at all surprising.
"But, but, my anecdote11" Your unrelated one that's really touching on homelessness and the problems of the war on drugs (which party is primarily responsible for that?
I bet you also think it's the liberals/feminists fault, don't you?)
Just all merges together for you, doesn't it?
Don't we know this is a zero sum game?
If we spend resources on sex trafficking, why, suddenly other trafficking is somehow magically not dealt with.
I mean, total "misuse" of the term surely, to label sex trafficking as trafficking and spend resources on it.
But the important part to you, the part you really need to get out there, is it's somehow the libs fault for Republican behavior.
And you're TOTALLY a liberal.
Feminist too, just against resources spent for sex trafficking of women.
Yeah, totally.
