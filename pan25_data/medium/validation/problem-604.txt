Think of advertisers on a social media platform like Twitter... once hate speach and really crazy shit crosses a line, they all get cold feet and leave.

That’s not it though.
From what I’ve read, it’s more the fact that Kanye had the lunacy to ask trump to be his running mate why Trump is throwing him under the bus.
Trump sabotaged himself by claiming in openly that the Fuentes ‘gets’ him.
If you think Kanye is cunning enough to orchestrate the second part, you give him way too much credit.
I get your point and agree except what im referring to is that Kanye brought the nazi with him and trump legit didn't know that was going to happen.. that in turn set the stage for the entire scandal.
This is what just happened to trump... specifically because of him having dinner with one of the biggest holocaust denying, nazis in the usa.
Except for his situation, the "advertisers" are people who either donate to him for his run/ rich people etc that support him.
They have a better option without the bullshit now (aka Ron DeSantis) it's a no Brainer for them after this.
Plus I will add, trumps announcement speach lacked the fire he had in 2016 which is another sign of what's to come... and that was before this shit.
As an aside, given all the unbelievable things trump has brought into normalcy, a la ‘I can shoot someone and not lose any votes’, how much do you really think this situation will have on his viability?
Personally I hope he gets so angry and desperate that he goes scorched earth against the GOP and tells his base to vote for him as a write in 2024 candidate against DeSantis or tells his base not to vote at all.
You could be right about trump having an unlimited switch of ridiculous actions where he never sees the consequences, but I would point out all the extremely rich people who even before this dinner have said they would rather support DeSantis and I think at the heart of this, that's what matters most.
Those people's influence and support is - on the backend- what gave trump his power.
