This is likely more for events held at those properties instead of intended for people out for a picnic, but laws should be applied equally so....
It's generally not in a laws favor.
If it is rarely used in crimes, then it is not a problem and you resolve nothing by doing this.

I'm OK with this.
.50 cal is a huge damn round and I can't think of a valid use for one in a non-combat urban environment.
Why?
Parks aren't secure areas and if someone is licensed to carry why shouldn't they be able to carry in a park.
This doesn't seem like a strategy that will change anything.
Again, OK with all this.
Nothing seems to create barriers to purchase.
I'm sure someone will complain about no under 21s, but that's the group most likely to shoot up a school, so....
School shootings are exceedingly rare.
It seems like a bad idea in general to fuck with civil rights when such a tiny fraction of a population does an extremely rare crime.
Not very often at all, like a couple times a decade (at least for .50BMG).
So what if only a handful of people would be affected by this part.
I would think that's a point in the law's favor.
That's not what was said though.
It didn't say at events, it said county party such as parks.
This pretty much means they are banning firearms in large public spaces and only allowing police to carry there.
This doesn't mean they will be increasing security there to enforce such restrictions.
Basically they are slapping no guns allowed signs and calling it a day.
It is a non solution that seems more at targeting licensed carriers then those who intend violent criminal acts in these spaces.
You are using that extreme rarity to justify a broad ban/policy on an entire group of people.
And this policy will probably not actually have an impact on it.
A point in the law’s favor is that it would affect practically zero criminal use while banning legal firearm enthusiasts from owning those firearms?
I don’t know about you, but my idea of an effective law is when it has the minimal effect on non-criminals, but a much larger effect on criminals.
This idea sounds like it’s designed to target legal gun ownership with a minimal effect on criminal use, or in other words, the exact opposite of an effective law.
