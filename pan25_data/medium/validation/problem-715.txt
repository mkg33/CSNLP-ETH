Probably the worst trade deal ever.
A wnba player which most people never knew about (and rightfully so), got caught with weed in Russia.
She broke the law.
Oh buddy.
He wasn't convicted because the weapons he was selling were killing people.
He was convicted because he didn't have a license to sell those weapons.
This dude is a speck of dust compared to the American war machine.
You're talking about "Lord of War", great movie but the driving point at the end was that he was a small part of something much bigger.
Also that movie ends with the US government allowing him to operate because it was convenient to them to have a fringe arms dealer selling to their allies without the US being directly involved.
Similar to "War Dogs", the underlying theme in those movies is that these arm dealers are small fries in the grand scheme of things.
Also, is so idiotic to resume a person to a pothead.
But is not shocking, since many prisoners in usa are in due to pot possession/consumption when nowadays many states already allow it, you still talk down on people for consuming it.
It's so weird listening to americans talk about gun aftereffects, when many societal problems in usa could be dealt with if americans didn't have easy access to guns, especially auto and semi auto rifles (I mean, what in the hell, how can civilians have automatic rifles??
).
