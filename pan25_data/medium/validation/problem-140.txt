For Crimea Russia used to issue passports with "issuer: Krasnodarsky Krai" (a neigbouring Russian region) instead of "issuer: Republic of Crimea", that's how EU can't distinguish passports from legitimate Russian ones.
This isn't Russia being clever and avoiding restrictions, this only screws over the people that have passports issued in those regions.
That still won't work most of the time because most gov.
services in Europe will just ask for clarification or evidence that it was issued within the actual borders of Russia.
But that's a win for the EU and Ukraine.
Russia issuing passports in Crimea in the name of another land is admitting that they don't have the authority to issue passports in Crimea's name.
This is not a "sanction" against Russia, but rather the EU saying "I don't think you own Crimea, so this passport you issued in a foreign Ukrainian city doesn't make any more sense to me than if you said it was done in Barcelona or Berlin".
This is what the EU is saying: The "new Russian territories" are Ukrainian land, so Russian authorities doing anything "official" there don't have any more authority, in the eyes of the EU, than a random dude claiming his house is a country.
A passport expedited by Russia in Kherson, according to the EU, hasn't been expedited by a competent authority of the city, so for all they care it's a forged one.
Imagine the only passport you can get is a Russian one and you want to flee and the EU says nah you can only flee with a Ukrainian one but you can’t get one… This just punishes victims while making a nice sounding political message.
(Also if they were fleeing they can just request alyssum straight away and it doesn’t matter where their passport came from.
).
Ukrainians who can only get a Russian passport are victims.
Russians will have passports issued from Russia and it will still be recognised.
The fact people don’t realise this is why we always end up with shit government.
Never think out what the people you vote for are actually going to do.
This is very basic reasoning.
Yet some people clearly couldn’t understand such a simple thing as only Ukrainians get passports issued in Ukraine.
Simple fact, the only people who get passports issued in Ukraine are Ukrainians.
Ukrainian Russian passports will only be issued to Ukrainians.
Russians live in Russia and therefore will get legit recognised Russian issued Russian passports.
Not rocket science.
Yet too complex for you.
Explain what?
How the only people getting passports issued in Ukraine are Ukrainians?
And if you’re in a part that Russia controls it would be a Russian one you could get?
You do know Russia annexed parts of Ukraine?
Ukrainians in that part of the country literally can’t get a passport from their country because Russia are being dicks.
They can’t just send a form in the post or receive the passport in the post.
Therefore their only option at this time would be a Russian one.
You’re a complete fool for not understanding that.
Simple shit.
Ok.
So Ukrainians live in this country called Ukraine.
They got attacked by this power crazed fuck called Putin who controls Russia.
Putin being a nut job that he is annexed parts of the country with a fake vote.
Because Russia is well known for killing fleeing people of any side.
As well as known for killing entire villages.
Many people would think it wise to stay where they are and hope that Ukraine can take it back.
If they need to leave the country for whatever reason they need a passport.
Only offices in Russian controlled parts issuing passports are issuing Russian ones because Russia pretending it‘s Russia now.
So Ukrainians who need a passport will be told to go fuck themselves if they try and use the only passport they can currently get through no fault of their own.
They are not at fault for Putin being a madman.
Not as stupid as you since I pointed out the alyssum thing in my first fucking post.
Literally, you’re repeating what I originally pointed out.
Secondly, try getting to a viable country without a plane.
No trains, busses, etc.
go to a border via Russia and get rejected as the borders are closed.
Countries have been rejecting claims at their land borders too.
It punishes Russia.
If Russia issued a passport for the city of Manchester, would any country accept that?
Nope, because Russia does not own Manchester, they have no authority to issue legal documentation in their name.
In fact, if you showed up with a Russian passport issued in Manchester, any authority would simply assume that you forged your passport or, if it's legit, it was the product of an error.
This is the exact same concept but applied to Ukrainian cities that Russia claim as theirs.
This is the EU just saying "wait, if Donetsk is Ukrainian, why would Russia issue a passport in their name?
Is this a fake passport, or did Russia make a mistake?".
The alternative to this is the same as accepting Russia is now Donetsk's owner.
