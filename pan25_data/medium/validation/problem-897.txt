Facebook is becoming a real political powder-keg.
Not saying it’s the wrong move but who decides what to suppress and what to let grow?
Should they be in charge?
Not advocating allowing hate to flourish, just looking for thought-provoking dialogue on this matter.
That’s not arbitrary.
It is a crime in Brazil, we are a Federation, unlike the US, and these kind of comments can fall under the law.
Usually the social medias are lenient about this kind of content, even Professional Journalists were advocation for the overthrowing of government, but I guess now that the government is going after all the anti-democratic influencers, the sites are preemptively deleting criminal content.
Suppression of information which is endorsed and controlled by a democratic government is ok, but these social media sites have no problem allowing tyrannical leaders to post whatever they want?
And the same people will get behind the people in places like Iran if the want to use their social media to organize against a non democratic regime.
That’s all fine.
Such a bunch of hypocrites!
