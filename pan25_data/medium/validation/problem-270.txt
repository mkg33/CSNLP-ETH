From what I've read Putin had intelligence which led him to believe the support they had from eastern Ukraine meant that the rest of the country was basically simply waiting to rejoin Russia.
Putin's gameplan is to rebuild the USSR, Ukraine is ultimately going to rejoin the motherland that's how Putin sees it.
He saw an opportunity and went for it, totally unprepared to have ukraine fight back with western support.
We will not give up because we want the same resources that Putin is after.
From a strategic point of view we also do not want the USSR to be rebuilt, a stronger Russia is not good for us.
I think if that happened there would absolutely be a joining of Chinese and Russian forces but fkr the time being china is staying pretty neutral until Russia has more to offer.
They've threatened America, the UK...wonder when they'll threaten France too.
Which will be even more embarrassing because of France's nuclear policy.
Russia merely adopted 'escalate to deescalate.'
The French invented it.
