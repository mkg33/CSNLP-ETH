Happily, Stalin stroked out and shit/pissed his pants and died after they covered his face in leeches in an attempt to bring down his blood pressure.
Hoping for a sequel.
We could put a Tomahawk Cruise Missile in Putin's lap tomorrow - blowing him out several windows as a fine spray of giblets.
It is they took years to find Bin Laden..Russia like America can with Americas POTUS can quickly get the Leaders to safety..Both have radars, Satelites etc..Imagine if a Russian said " Americas POTUS lives bevause we allow it like FFS.
Now, it was pretty obvious that I'm not trying to sound like an expert on hypersonic missiles.
Just pointing out that Russia has the ability to strike at the very least in a retaliatory manner, which is not consistent with the opinion that Putin only lives because we allow it, and that there's no deterrent other than the US whims.
But since you're clearly coming in as the expert and trying to "own" me, why don't you tell us what you know about these missiles?
Nah, I clearly didn't.
Or at least, I was under the impression that there was something different about the current generation of those missiles that the Russians have access to that the US does not, something that affects the predictability, like not needing to go outside the atmosphere or something.
Russia possesses around six thousand warheads, of which about sixteen hundred are actively deployed.
Nuclear planning doesnâ€™t revolve around best case scenarios either.
