Should they wait until they stop?
I doubt you prefer being reactionary in YOUR life so why should we expect others to?
True, but there is no limit to (some) Americanâ€™s sense of entitlement, and the expectation that life should be easy.
SBUX could command ten dollars a cup and ppl would still line up for it.
Starbucks provided that without unions.
It's a multi national corporation, the epitome of capitalism.
Your argument doesn't seem to account for that.
Just curious how you argue for unionizing at a company providing such great benefits already.
You drive up their costs further, eventually people stop buying coffee at $8 a cup.
Thoughts?
People think unions are all about the money.
They're just as much about safe working conditions.
I can think of quite a few potential hazards at a coffee shop that has blenders and heats water close to the boiling point on the regular.
It's great that Starbucks started out not treating labour like livestock and I hope they continue to maintain that bare minimum of humanity.
But that would go against the centralizing nature of Capitalism so it would be imprudent to lean too heavily on such expectations.
My justification remains the same as in my previous response.
It is proactive to defend yourself from the Capitalists you labour for before you need to.
I can't see any reason to extend a head start to the people who benefit the most from the value you create.
Sure, maybe some employers have regulations and training that the bosses think are sufficient.
Many don't, and a union gives you the power to push back if you need to.
Let me guess, you've completed 2 years of a liberal arts degree at an American University.
You haven't experienced what real socialism looks like and still have doe eyes for a system that will absolutely destroy society and lead to dictatorships.
