Good, make MTG the face of the party.
She’s mean, spiteful, cruel and her inner ugliness seeps into her physical appearance.
She is wholly unlikeable to regular people and only marginally appealing to people mean like her.

She is a grating, unpleasant and boring to watch and she’s going to go over the target and piss everybody off.
She won’t last.
