Let’s not forget he only did the right thing because he thinks the constitution of the United States of America was inspired by god.
In our congress, created to be separate from religion this fuckstick testified that god was integral, not to the content, to the creation of our constitution.
If you need examples I can easily provide them, but again there is no law banning having religious views in politics.
The church can’t take power nor has there been a church taking power in politics.
I guess you could call the whole SCOTUS abolition removal a religious move….. but that would be the only large recent example and even then that has always been a back and forth topic for years if not decades.
My point is more to the fact that we’re willingly being led by people who still believe in fairytales.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
It is separate though?
There isn’t a law outlawing people in power being religious, the law is that religion cannot form an actual powerhouse within politics.
And if you make the call that you can’t be religious when getting into politics you are now infringing on the 1st Amendment.
Again, I’m not arguing that anyone broke the law or even evaded it by being religious.
I never once argued for removing the right of the religious to believe or preach their views.
The point I’ve been making, to say it louder for those in the back, is that religion is a disease.
It’s lies, slander, and bigotry wrapped up in the guise of humanitarianism, and if people truly kept it to themselves as the first amendment guarantees their right to do, I wouldn’t have a problem.
The religious freaks refuse to adhere to the barrier between church and state and continue their attempts to force all free Americans to comply with their imaginary beliefs.
And the religious tolerant seem to think they have a point worth listening to and refuse to reinforce the wall that was supposed to exist between religion and politics.
Rusty Bowers is a particularly nasty fucking zealot for arguing under oath that the US constitution was inspired by God.
He’s not the first to think that.
There are insurrectionist factions of Americans that validate their desire to topple our government because they believe the constitution as god inspired it isn’t being followed correctly.
My politics have never fucked with anyone’s religion, I’ve never argued to a bunch of fucking Christians that they should elect their priest, so why do we keep normalizing their priests telling us who to elect?
!
Ok?
There are billions of people that still believe in a higher power around the world and ,whether or not you agree, people in the US have the freedom to have religious views under the 1st Amendment.
If you think that religious individuals shouldn’t hold power you are infringing on the 1st Amendment at that point.
As long as the church and state remains separate I don’t see why it matters if someone is religious or not?
If you’re at a work place holiday party and a colleague comes up and says “Merry Christmas, our lord is born.” That’s fine, that person is just a rational Christian person.
But you’d probably think twice if a colleague came up to you and said, “merry Christmas, I can’t wait to find out what Santa brought me this year.” That’s absurd, Santa is a children’s fantasy, he’s not real.
