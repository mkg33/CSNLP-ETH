If these people were planning on attending this World Cup up until they found out about the homophobia, they're bad people.
Everyone paying to attend this disaster is.
By fearing hostility, I assume they recognize the rampant and blatant persecution Qatar has made no effort to quell or even cover up.
The 7 year jail term to non-Muslim gay men there, and the death penalty to all Muslim gay men and their World Cup ambassador describing homosexuality as "damage in the mind" might have something to do with that.
If any LGBTQ fans are really thinking the World Cup would be the time to test the Qatari government, Iâ€™d ask they do some more prep work before taking this on.
I think a boycott sends the best message to FIFA.
Showing up there just puts money in that system and puts you at risk.
And by boycotting, I certainly hope they mean under no circumstances will any of them set one toe in Qatar because they would absolutely and undoubtedly be in danger if they did.
Homophobia, corruption, slave labor, take your pick from the innumerable reasons why no decent person would have anything to do with the 2022 World Cup.
If a person was willing to look past any of those, they're vile.
