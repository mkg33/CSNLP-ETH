There's nothing russia can do vs Poland.
Not just because it's a NATO member but Poland would eat russian forces.
Also russia gathering troops near a border is now a clear indicator they will invade.
I think Russia got lucky that Trump didn't win and dissolved NATO.
Because the invasion attempt of Poland would have been the end of their army.
And any fantasies of retreating from Ukraine and 'trying again in five years' is just that: a fantasy.
Such deeply corrupted nation won't have a stronger army (or economy) in five years.
But Russia's Western neighbours will.
Dissolution of NATO wouldve needed congress right?
As much as trump may have wanted it it wouldve been basically impossible because the actual republican base wouldve had fucking none of that.
Trump was just saber rattling, he was trying to get NATO partners to pay their fair share instead of just footing the bill to the US people.
NATO needs to be able to stand on its own not piggyback on the US.
If world war breaks out I don't think the us could fight a war on the European front and China simultaneously.
To be fair the Ukrainian prime minister to tell him to fuck off and that's exactly what he did.
I think the old adage don't bite the hand that feeds you works in this instance.
All these weapons that we are sending Ukraine the military industrial complex gets paid for Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and many others are not footing the bill for those weapons being sent.
So why should Elon have to?
If it meant that much and is that big of a help why has pentagon not paid Elon for the services he's providing?
I'm saying maybe it would have behooved the prime minister to not bight the hand that was feeding him.
He's entitled to his opinion's as anyone else is.
But what is it you authoritarian leftists tout all the time?
That your free speech has consequences.
Guess the prime ministers free speech cost the Ukrainians their starlink.
