Maybe they are going to send more abrams to Poland and Germany and keep them there to shore up stock?
After almost half a century and numerous conflicts the Abrams might actually for the first time get to see action for the specific thing it was designed for.
Stopping Russian armor in a European ground war.
David Attenborough: And here we have the majestic Abrams returning to its natural territory, the plains of Eastern Europe.
See how it jovially bounces as it seeks out its prey.
pretty much the same as Desert Storm.
(despite lack of air superiority and stuff like apaches and a-10's, and ac-130's ... it's Abrams' chance to really shine again.
Party like it's 1993.
).
The only bad faith argument here is yours; you’re trying to paint the picture that all of these problems have the same impact.
Comparing fuel costs and concluding they are similar is peak Reddit armchair general.
Did you know that the Abrams fuel consumption is variable depending on type of fuel?
What happens when Ukrainian supply lines get pinched and now the abrams is a huge drain on constrained resources that other mission critical systems need?
Assuming of course, the training, maintenance materials , and actual man hours behind servicing these things are not an issue?
It’d make sense to send them where there are us bases so they can train European crews and integrate them in a limited capacity before the new LEOs start hitting the production line and get distributed.
Especially if the new Abrams is going to be diesel; it wouldn’t be a super short shelf life kind of program.
These people grew up with Diesel engines.
Ukraine inherited Soviet technology and trained their service members on such technology.
Except the parts, training, and entire logistical procurement process for the Leo takes place on that continent by not only Germans, but by professional European armies and partners.
Again, there is an entire continent of people trained to support the Leo.
Ukraine shares borders with people who procure the parts for these systems.
They share a border with people who are highly trained in these systems.
They share a border with a friendly bloc that supports them economically.
They share said blocnwith people that are involved in every step of the procurement process; even if it’s just delivering oil to a plant that machines parts.
Or driving to work to fill out paperwork.
They don’t.
That’s again, peak Reddit armchair general.
Both of them having x number of issues Doesn’t mean these issues are equally disruptive.
You know what they haven’t been doing?
Operating turbine based tank systems on a platform that is very different then their neighbors.
The us has bases in Germany in Poland; so servicing abrams is much easier.
Again; the US military is not engaged.
How do you support abrams when you don’t want a nato country getting directly involved?
You think it’s wise to tow 20 abrams back to Poland every day?
Also: side note: And I’m sorry, what?
The german industrial base is fine.
Their biggest issue is culturally they haven’t felt the need to maintain an army.
Their primary means of support have been financial and humanitarian (partially because they gave away their tank stocks to Poland, which gifted them to Ukraine).
To say that they haven’t been doing much is complete shit; they are the largest supporter of Ukraine in the eurozone.
Comparing these systems and then saying tanks are doable because these other systems are is again, silly.
Tanks require much more support to operate.
My logic is fine here.
Okay, the idea that you need to service tanks outside of Ukraine is one that really shows your hand.
Do you realize how much of a nightmare it would be if Ukraine had to do this?
For any tank; but especially for the Abrams which has to be moved much further and take up more space and more maintenance time?
The logistics behind himars or Javelins is different from a tank.
Same thing with howitzers and the like.
Fuel isn’t the only thing.
We could support these in desert storm and every other war if the us army is engaged; because that means the logistics part of the army (aka the thing that is its primary product) is wound up and deployed.
Ukraine has much tighter constraints than we, or any other European nation does with manpower as they are at war.
It’s imperative to give them tech with them least resistance to use.
I.e.
Leos.
