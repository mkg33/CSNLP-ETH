"If households are classified by annual income, the sales tax is sharply regressive.
Under the AFT proposal, taxes would rise for households in the bottom 90 percent of the income distribution, while households in the top 1 percent would receive an average tax cut of over $75,000.
If households are classified by consumption level, a somewhat different pattern emerges.
Households in the bottom two-thirds of the distribution would pay less than currently, households in the top third would pay more.
Still, households at the very top would pay much less, again receiving a tax cut of about $75,000.
There appears to be little sound motivation for heaping huge tax cuts on precisely the groups whose income and wealth have benefited the most from recent events, and raising burdens significantly on others.
