It's actually crazy how obvious this fact is in Germany.
When I'm driving around and pay attention, I notice Ukrainian number plates every few minutes.
Before the war, I had never consciously noticed a single Ukrainian number plate, but currently they are ubiquitous.
The worst thing for Ukraine is that most of these people will not return home after war.
An already economically weak country that has suffered great damage in the war is also losing a large part of its active population in the form of combat casualties and refugees.
It seems that the war will last at least another couple of years, and most of the Ukrainian refugees (among my acquaintances) do not want to sit on benefits and depend on the goodwill of foreign states.
They are actively looking for work in the countries that have adopted them and settled down in a new place.
I am sure that many of the refugees, after years of work, will not want to lose most of their belongings for the second time and will not move back, especially if they are among those whose houses and cities were completely destroyed and only ruins await them.
