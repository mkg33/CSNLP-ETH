In cold shutdown the plant is in as safe a condition as possible were something to happen, and it would not be a severe accident with just loss of cooling (there may also be additional capabilities e.g.
Post Fukushima the US added features like auxiliary generators, pumps, wiring to expedite restoring cooling & make up water).
A complete loss of off-site power and emergency generators would be more like a three mile Island accident than Fukushima and no where near Chernobyl.
Targeted attacks could result in worse outcomes of the intent were to do so.
Everything they say is either a lie or a blame game for something they have already/about to or considering (depending on responses from the rest of the world).
Jackass pukin will go down in history as a total prick, like the other Russian bellends from the past.
Moving all equipment from the plant aswell.
If they do withdraw completely there will be a catch.
Another goodwill gesture would sit as well as a slipped disk.
There is room for safe ass moves, like pushing the scram button, or much better: injection of large quantities of boron inside the reactors before the Russian leave the plant.
