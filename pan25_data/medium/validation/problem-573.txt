Just like how most republicans rally around trump and deny all bad things he has or could have done most democrats rally behind Biden and deny anything bad about him when in all honestly only reason he got presidency was because he wasn’t trump and I feel like none of what I said is a particularly false statement.
I don’t like how presidents have become as idealized in the minds of the people as they have become.
“My president can do no wrong”.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
It was basically a rally.
It was a preview for his reelection campaign, having Harris there too.
There's nothing inherently bad about rallies when it comes to election season.
Interestingly enough, for the lols, he's a sitting POTUS, he could declassify them at will, if he wanted.
Trump's were discovered after he lost the election.
Another point is that Trump's had fucking nuclear secrets that parties known to have paid his son in law billions would want... and let's not forget KSA is at war with Yemen, and their military sucks.
No one was trying to buy Biden's forgotten docs.
When ?
Anytime I see anyone say anything bad about him the other person is obviously a troll and a trump supporter a super ultra right maga terrorist and for your information I never voted for trump not even the first time.
I never said that everyone kisses his ass like republicans do trump but many do just cause you don’t does not discredit what I said it just means you know that people can do stupid shit and should be judged accordingly.
No I’m almost positive that Biden won mostly because if trump wasn’t so hated and the only other option at that time he would not have won and you can find plenty of people saying even now if trump runs again they will vote in whoever is in opposition.
