I'm curious how these Iranian revolutionaries feel about separatism in Iran.
Examples being Arabs in the southwest, Kurds in the west.
Baluchs in the south east.
Azeris in the northwest.
I have lived in multiple Azeri and Kurdish cities in Iran because of my dad’s job, If you go talk about separatism to a Kurd chances of you getting sweared at are very high.
I know there is foreign backed separatists groups who are in Iraq RN ,but the people don’t feel that way at least the majority of them.
Same story with Arabs not to mention them and Kurds doing most of the heavy lifting during the bloody Iran-Iraq War, Sadam invaded Iran with the hopes of Arabs in Khuzestan turning against the government, but he was proven wrong.
Are Iranians willing to see the borders of imperial Iran destroyed in favor of a commitment to liberalism and self determination?
I wouldn’t feel good about losing parts of our country as we already lost big chunks of it during our history, but hypothetically if one of our ethnic minorities wanted out I don’t want the central government preventing them by force.
That is against everything we are standing for in the streets right now.
Yes IRGC launched artillery and drone strikes in the Kurdish regions in Iraq.
both KDPI and PJAK operate from northern IRAQ they also have many Iranian members, but they don’t have local support in Iran the Kurdish resistance you are talking about is almost nonexistent in Iran .
Fortunately that is not the case right now for us,even though regime’s propaganda machine is trying to tell its base that the protesters are separatists ethnic minorities who are tricked by foreign agents majority of the people are quick to call their BS out.
The situation with Iran and Its ethnic minorities are a bit complicated I mean Kurds and Baluchs are counted as Iranic peoples(Kurds outside of Iran have a very different opinion on this which is respectable I’m speaking on behalf of Iranian Kurds), no government in Iran’s history tried to do ethnic cleansing ,because Iran is made of these ethnicities the thought of an Iran with only Persian people never even occurs in many peoples head , we made our histories with one another,had revolutions together,toppled governments together and fought wars together.
Many of our dynasties in the past were made of Kurdish or Azeri tribes like the Kajars (Azeri)or Safavids(both), Persians didn’t rule over other ethnicities we ruled together.
The current regime taking a page out of Gaddafi’s book has pinned us against each other for years they were usually unsuccessful though.
