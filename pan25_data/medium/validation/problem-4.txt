Presumably the Texas state constitution has no mechanism for corrective elections, and certainly not limited to single counties.
OTOH, Article XVI, Section 50 is over 17 pages, roughly 3 times longer than the ENTIRE US Constitution, and covering an issue which would be far better suited to being a mere statute (so easier to revise).
Like most things excreted from Patrick's multiple orifices, this is at most sound and fury signifying nothing.
Apologies to Shakespeare for using his words in relation to this fine specimen of Texas thought.
OTOH, the preceding phrase is exquisitely apt for Patrick.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
I've skimmed it.
Especially striking was the proposal for an electoral college for statewide offices.
Methinks the solons who came up with that plank either didn't consider that Reynolds v Sims would apply to such a body or (more likely?)
they have no clue that SCOTUS decision is on the books.
That is, Loving and Harris counties wouldn't have one elector each.
FWIW, Article XVI doesn't appear to have any section giving the state government, governor nor legislature, the power to call do-over elections.
More like if Harris county had only 1 elector, then the 215 counties with the smallest population would have to share 1 elector.
between making it harder for everyone to vote and then the threat of having to go to the pols 2,3,4,8 times before an election is settles seems designed to do 2 things, ensure they get the outcome they want and it kills most people's desire to vote, this seems like the right wing end game of the last 50 years; tell people gov doesn't work, prove it when they elect you, make them question the validity of elections, make them redo a few, watch voter participation drop to single digital.
