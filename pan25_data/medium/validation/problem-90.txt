Full mention (didn't fit in the title) “Today I spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who congratulated me on my electoral victory, wished a good government and the strenhening of the relationship between our countries.
Brazil has returned, seeking dialogue with everyone and committed to the search for a world without hunger and with peace.”.
Yeah, seems about normal for any newly elected president.
Or do people think he's going to tell Putin to fuck off?
just cause some dude gave them a cruise don't mean they wont eat eachother out when the need arises.
That's exactly what he should do.
You'd think against the interest of Brazil would be dealing with a country under a dictatorship that has repeatedly threatned the world with nuclear war, invaded a peaceful neighboring country, is actively committing genocide and terrorism and finally, is sanctioned by dozens of countries.
He gets cheaper goods if he buys stuff from Russia, same as the EU getting cheaper oil from Azerbaijan during the last conflict they had with Armenia.
There's a huge difference between Russia and Saudi Arabia.
Russia has destabilized all of Europe.
Its threatened the world with Nuclear holocaust as the world's largest nuclear arsenal and well over 100k people have died in Ukraine.
Its no comparable at all.
It was immoral was when the war started.
Now its moved way beyond that.
Is it immoral?
yes of course, however it is the norm in international relations.
Or did other countries stop trade relations with the coalition of the willing over their invasion?
maybe they stopped buying Saudi coalition Oil?
of course not.
There's a huge, huge difference between Russia and what you're referring to.
China is an internal conflict which is way more complicated but on a very different scale than that of Ukraine.
It also destabilizes China and impacts the chinese where as Ukraine destabilizes an entire region like Europe and impacts dozens of countries.Russia has threatened the world with Nuclear holocaust as the world's largest nuclear arsenal and well over 100k people have died in Ukraine.
They're actively kidnapping children, raping and terrorizing a whole country.
Its not comparable at all.
This is way more than just morals.
This is also more than just economy.
This is world security that also impacts Brazil's direct relationship with dozens of other countries.
Dozens of countries are paying higher prices in gas, oil, food and many other goods to actively stop Russia.
Some have absolutely no heating or electricity.
There are whole countries with people freezing to death this winter.
The economies from dozens of these countries are suffering, hundreds of millions are being directly impacted not just from the war but from the sanctions in place to deter Russia.
Not to mention this is entirely against Brazil's best interest.
It may benefit them economically short term but in the long run it destabilizes Europe, strains relationships with multiplr countries whose economies are being directly impacted by this, and may ultimately even lead Brazil to being sanctioned if the war goes on long enough.
Then I have to read these ignorant whataboustim comments like this because hey, if China is killing their citizens and you didn't act on that then nobody should act on anything.
I guess it's too much of a hassle for the "world's fifth most populous country" to actually act in their best interest and strenhen relationships, stabilize the world and save on trade agreements later rather than make pennies and lose credibility with multiple countries.
I mean fuck half the world's population.
Am i right?
I think it's worse.
The US destabilized South American institutions and supported dictatorships, which is bad (very bad) by itself (institutional stability is one of main requirements for development), but they didn't invade and conquered territory in South America, which is worse in my opinion.
