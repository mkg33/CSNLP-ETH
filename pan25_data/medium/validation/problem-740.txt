If you bothered to go to the absolute minimum of effort to have any idea or knowledge in the slightest about what you are talking about you would know that the striking nurses are leaving what the government believes are safe staffing numbers in place - a "Christmas day service".
No wards are being left devoid of staff.
However the point being made is that this Christmas day level of service that is apparently so unacceptable on a strike day is actually very commonplace and nurses are filling the gaps of the 40,000 unfilled nurse posts with bank shifts, unpaid overtime, working through their unpaid breaks etc., and the government thinks this is fine to continue, provided we call it service as normal and not a strike.
No-one is leaving anyone to die except for the government who are deliberately running the NHS into the ground to ensure its imminent privatisation.
Imagine if working people ignored strike laws the same way employers ignore labor laws, and the govt ignores labor law violations.
