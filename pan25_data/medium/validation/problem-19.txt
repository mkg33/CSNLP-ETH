I know my situation is anecdotal.
Is there a slim possibility the placebo effect is at work here?
Ya, maybe.
But I can hold my arm out in front me for more than 10 seconds now and I can go up a set of stairs without needing to sit down and rest afterwards.
I’m able to provide for my family again and actually enjoy the time I spent with them.
I can jump on the trampoline with my son.
And I haven’t thought “ do I have enough life insurance for when I either die nodding off in my truck or will my policy pay when I finally give up and kill myself”.
It was 8 or 9 months of hell, weak and completely exhausted everyday.
The private prison lobby needs to be disbanded.
The fact that private prisons are even a thing is insane.
I bring this up because the industry actively lobbies to keep weed illegal to boost their incarceration rate - as they get paid by the state per inmate and make money off of prison labor.
Private prisons are financially motivated to keep recidivism rates high - which should be the EXACT opposite of what prisons should shrive for.
