I can't believe we're having this argument.
Once Adam Schiff is found out to be dud, don't you think MSM and the Dems would prefer to shift their weight to Porter than to Lee?
Their voting record is nearly identical but if I were a corporate Dem and I had to plug my nose and choose, I'd pick the one who very recently voted for new R&D subsidies to pharma companies that are just gonna get used for marketing and stock buy-backs.
I'm not gonna pretend that Barbara Lee's record is pristine but if you are looking for the anti-establishment candidate, you're backing the wrong horse.
In general, be courteous to others.
