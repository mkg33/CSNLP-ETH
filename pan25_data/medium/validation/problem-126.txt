Russia invaded Ukraine because some Ukrainians speak Russian.
Also because Nato is nearby.
And because the Ukrainians are nazis.
And because the Ukrainians are satanists.
Hold up- I missed those ones Those are awesome If Ukraine is sitting on those, Russia is more screwed than it already is!
They also said that the trans (yes, transgender and transexual) were super soldiers at one point.
So either Russia is lying, or those hormones are better than expected.
Okay I actually did some research into this after that one trans woman did really well in swimming and it became a controversy.
I was under the impression that it's actually quite harmful to your bones to get those hormone treatments.
What's her face definitely lost a lot of speed after the hormones.
Still better than your typical girl because she was like 6 foot something, but I wasn't aware of the secret superpowers that trans people receive.
That's why you get all the russian doping at the Olympic level, they're just evening the playing field because the western athletes are all on hormones so they can transition /s.
Oh yeah, all the trans men, who are definitely at a huge advantage, having grown up as women then transitioning afterwards and suffering from bone density issues.
I'd fear them.
Oh gosh- they already did it too.
The 1169 anglo-normal invasion of Ireland is definitely the reason for Russia invading Ukraine.
At least we have a valid motive.
Not saying their right or wrong.
Just saying that you can’t over simply something and still expect it to make logical sense.
I recommend you take a quick read of how Texas became a part of America and a state (very interesting read, and many similarities).
Due to the complex history of the area, the “some Ukrainians” that you are referring to would probably not consider themselves Ukrainian.
They would mostly likely consider themselves Russian, speaking Russian, on land they believe belongs to them.
Ooh Yes Because Soviet Russia occupied Czechoslovakia instead of freeing it, along with other "liberated" nations, basically taking Germany's victims as their war gains, and then Putin believed that Russia was entitled to them after they voted to leave.
Oh yeah I forgot about that The Sims 3 does feature the concept of turning your imaginary friend into a real person, which could essentially be a limitless supply of soldiers, to be fair.
Again, I’m not justifying the invasion or anything that happened after.
I’m just saying that both sides are trying to simply something that should not be simplified.
As for the nazi rhetoric, that is mostly just based on roles that (some) Ukrainians played during WWII.
They did commit atrocities against Jews specifically, similar to how if some was to want to attack Germany/Austria today they would say there are nazi’s there (the sound bites of course would never speak to actual numbers).
Also, I’m not against small studies, but if you click to look at the studies in the url you shared it goes to a German 404 error page.
Also, I would imagine that the National Agency of Ukraine for Civil Service would probably have more reliable stats rather then a graduate student calling 1200 random Ukrainians from a UK based phone number.
If I was an ethnic minority and someone called me to ask my status for “totally educational purposes” what is my incentive to not lie and say I’m part of the minority (why make myself a target?
)?
