The 'box' bit though was less out of compassion for Goop's character, and more about the anticipation.
I know the fear of thinking, almost knowing, that people I love are very dead.
I was wrong, of course, but man, I was left alone early as a 4-5-year-old as parents went to do shopping, and if they didn't return in like three hours, I'd straight up panic and leaf through photo albums, literally saying farewell to them.
Kind of explains why I even 25 years later get really anxious when I know that someone I love's riding a bus or on a plane.
So the box scene, with the dude desperately not trying to know something he perceives is right (and sadly turned out to be) did a fucking number (7) on me when I first watched it as a teen.
When you get a package and the first thought is that it could be your sons head, but to your relief itâ€™s just a bomb, you really need to rethink your life choices.
The szenario he mentioned alone speaks volumes about the retaliation he considers possible & appropriate for his acts and so has reasons to fear.
