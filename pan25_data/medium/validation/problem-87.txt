\^\^ For those who don't know - reparations were paid to slave owners (to compensate their loss of 'property') after the abolition of slavery - not to the slaves themselves.
Slaves were lucrative property for most slaveowners and were expensive to purchase in the first place.
Then they had to feed, house and clothe them (though they usually did the bare minimum in those respects).
This is why only the wealthy owned slaves generally speaking.
Politicians then, as they do now, liked to keep the wealthy happy, so this isn't really surprising from a historical perspective, as gross as it is to our modern eyes.
Not defending the practice of paying slaveowners reparations back in the day, just explaining the reasoning for it back then.
Edit-Since I had someone who didn't understand what "generally speaking" meant in my comment above.
Here's the explanation:
Generally speaking indicates it wasn't always the case.
There were families who owned one slave, and an even smaller group who owned two or three.
The Hollywood depictions of plantations with dozens and even hundreds of slaves were not that common as only the wealthy could afford to buy that many people, much less keep them.
None of this is an excuse for the abhorrent practice of slavery, or makes it any less terrible.
One person owned by another was ONE TOO MANY.
It was an ugly business that we shouldn't white wash but we also need to stop painting all pre-war southerners as evil and complicit.
One thing to keep in mind was that this also varied by state in the U.S.
Some states had more wealth, and more large plantations while others had less.
Some owned slaves, yes, and during the American Civil War fought to keep them.
Other Southerners (as many as half the fighting men in TN, for instance) fought for the North and most of them didn't support the practice or betraying their own country.
