There were concerns Microsoft is building cloud gaming monopoly.
Microsoft and nvidia made a deal regarding that.
Before they started buying companies they tried to get Sony on board for crossplay, Sony said no.
Crossplay between every other consoles happened and Sony said okay, but not to Xbox.
Then Microsoft started buying companies, now here we are, gamepass is a thing and Sony is acting like a bad ex girlfriend, obsessed with stopping anything that we as consumers want.
Sony said no to Game Pass because they didn't want MS having a monopoly on cloud gaming across all platforms.
I like how you are treating MS as the good guys with noble intentions.
As if they're not several times larger than Sony and already done far worse anti-consumer shit (like buying out Bethesda and making one of the most popular multiplatform IPs of all time exclusive).
No corporation is well-intentioned and I promise you this merger is not going to be beneficial for consumers.
Microsoft is not going on a spending spree buying out massive publishers for the sake of consumers or for benefiting other companies.
They said no to MS games being offered on PS as GP exclusives.
They've had zero issue allowing MS games on PS through the store (Outer Worlds and Minecraft).
They didn't say no to game pass, the said no to crossplay, please read the post before you debate it.
Every action they have made has been because Sony doesn't want to play nice and wants to stick to anti-consumerisms that also screw developers over because that's how they code their systems.
MS doesn't want to offer their games on other platforms unless they can bring GP to those platforms.
Because they have no interest in being "pro-consumer" (a laughable thing to say about any corporation, especially one like MS), they only have interest in dominating the cloud gaming market.
I don't want to hear about MS being anything but anti-consumer after turning Starfield into an exclusive title immediately after purchasing Bethesda despite it being a multiplatform game for most of it's development.
And I definitely don't want to hear it after their plans on making TES6 exclusive as well.
I'm not saying Sony isn't anti-consumer, all of these companies are, but Sony hasn't done anything that bad ever when it comes to exclusivity.
All of their exclusive IPs were built from the ground up on their own platform and made by studios they effectively built themselves.
Spider-Man is the only exception to that but even then that IP was more or less dead (as a video game IP) before Sony revived it, along with the fact that MS had the opportunity to take that IP themselves and turned it down.
You can't genuinely sit here and argue that MS is any better after what they did post-ZeniMax acquisition.
To buy out that many multiplatform IPs and immediately make them exclusive is purely anti-consumer.
