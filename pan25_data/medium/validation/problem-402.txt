I visited Peru years ago and found the people there to be some of the most brilliant, down-to-earth, friendly people imaginable.
I wish them the utmost fortune in their endeavors for better governance and I dearly hope to return one day.
Protestors want an election.
Boluarte supposedly vows to defend democracy.
There's no reason for her not to call an early election to quell the protests and violence.
no, protests by itself shouldn't automatically trigger the fall of a government, but after such political turmoil, an election is a very reasonable path forward.
An early election is not inherently un-democratic, especially when it is within the frameworks of the Peruvian constitution.
what you are ignoring is that Peru just undergone a massive political turmoil, with the sitting president arrested and the new president having overwhelming disapproval ratings.
personally I don't get why Boularte wouldn't want to do another election considering the only reason she is in the position is because she was hand selected by someone who then tried to launch a coup i would think she would jump on the oppurtunity to do a new election if only just to wash off the stink of Castillo and strenhen her own hand in dealing with congress.
