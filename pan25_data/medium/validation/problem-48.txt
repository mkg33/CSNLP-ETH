The mystery is how the GOP is going to come up with crazy new headlines to divert attention away from this and toward Hunter Biden, so that they can continue their plan of disenfranchising minority voters, rolling back women's rights, and giving tax breaks to corporations.
He summoned a mob to Washinon, had his minions whip them up into a frenzy, dispatched them to the Capitol, and aided them by not deploying police.
Whatâ€™s the mystery?
The thing is, there is enough frustration with trump within his base, that GOP now has the perfect window to all toss him to the wolves.
They just have to do it all together.
Any holdouts will keep whipping up the base.
If they all drop him at once, it will work and they can still salvage some of the party.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
But they won't.
A few wacky nut jobs are only in office because of his base.
They know they are killing their career by dropping him.
I have to laugh at it.
What better way to make people truly believe that Hunter Biden is guilty of something, even though he's never been charged with anything, than to pardon him?
People would never shut up about it.
Fines will be imposed and then paid by Republican donors.
Jail time will be discussed and then dismissed because of the bad optics of seeing a former president in an orange jumpsuit.
Trump won't be elected to office again, but he will return to Twitter where he will continue to fire up his base with fables of stolen elections and corrupt government.
He will keep blaming Biden of everything that Trump himself is guilty of.
