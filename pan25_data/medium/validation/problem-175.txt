I said something very similar a few hours ago.
She needs to get off the tv and shut up.
She seems weird and trying too hard to be cute and maybe get some fame out of this.
Her expressions, mannerisms, and just her general demeanor are a bit strange.
I fear she will fuck this up somehow, or end up in trouble herself.
These are professional journalists she is going up against and each one is going to try and get her to spill the beans.
Its a dangerous game she is playing.. Not to mention all the Maga Qnuts out there that know what she looks like now.
