To be honest with you, he is not the madman.
He is merely accepting to be a puppet of the far right and ultra religious in order to avoid trial.
He purposely knows that doing so will provoke a riot, but he doesn't care.
So in a way he is manipulating both citizens: the ones that revolt against these unlawful decisions, and the ones that are happy with it and think he is the right leader to enforce such anti liberal laws.
It's hard for me to fathom what the point of having judicial review of the law is if the knesset can just overrule it.
Then again I'm American and my Supreme Court is extremely screwed up as well, so maybe I'm not the best one to talk.
It's not against the new government.
It's against the set of rules they want to pass to make the government above the judicial system, making de facto the govt able to overturn the Supreme Court if they feel like it.
That's the reasoning behind it.
The official reason is that "they are flawed, and only a government chosen by a majority of people can fix them up".
Doing so is the first step to self proclaimed dictatorship, just like Russia or Iran.
This is nuts and I am very scared for my country.
