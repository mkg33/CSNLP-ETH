There is a guy called Beau of the Fifth column who talks a lot about community building and coalitions.
As it relates to the problem you just brought up, there are probably a lot of people in your neck of the woods that feel the same way.
We are lucky because we have tools that make it easier than ever to find them.

Beau also says "Voting is the lowest level of civic engagement".
I've been thinking about upping my civic engagement lately.
I'm from Michigan btw.
I watched something amazing happen on Tuesday, despite how loud the useful idiots are.
I think you guys can do the same down there if you work together.
Frankly, most Ohioans don't want it.
I have never met more inhospitable people anywhere else in the country than I did in Ohio.
The exception to the rule is some of the queer groups, but even then its often "I hate you but we'll get along.
".
Love Beau, and I’m constantly preaching this to folks.
There are 729 days between elections.
That’s a lot of days to build solidarity and community, to educate, to learn, et cetera.
It is crazy how it happens though.
I remember when that story about the litter box thing came out about 8 months back I was talking to an older guy in a machine shop.
The amount of passion he talked about this fake story with no truth to it as a key example of the schools/youth/world going to hell was amazing.
I don't know if I ever got through to this guy the premise to this world view was false.
His first computer was a smartphone.
He didn't grow up with them, so spotting the cracks on a dubious source of information is something outside of his skillset.
Like many of his peers.
I'm not gonna stop trying though.
Yeah, I live in the country.
The modern Democratic Party doesn't represent what would help me and the folks out here the most, but the Republican Party would only take money from us and punish us for daring to exist.
