“At a media briefing held on the sidelines of the first G-20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors’ (FMCBG) Meet, she said that the United States had already provided 46 billion dollars in security, economic and humanitarian aid.”.
So technically we are sending these funds in the form of military equipment.
Equipment from around the 2000’s era that has been sitting in storage and has been unused because we have advanced far beyond these platforms in the last 20 years.
Weapons and supplies.
It wouldn't make sense to send cash and have Ukraine buy weapons and supplies from other countries.
We gotta keep the U.S. military industrial complex fat and happy.
It's been weapons and supplies the whole time and mind you the equipment is mostly from pre 2000's Era.
All of this equipment would have otherwise rotted in our reserves.
The EU is handling Ukraines financials and the US is handing physical equipment.
There's a good thread below that gives quite a good breakdown of western aid to Ukraine.
Right for this specific package it is.
But the majority of everything we sent is not.
The US is more focused on military aid than economic in the grand scheme.
