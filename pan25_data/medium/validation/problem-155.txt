Right now, they are trying to get Ukraine to agree to allow Russia to just keep the territory they're currently occupying.
But any reasonable person knows that if Ukraine agreed to that, Russia would just invade again once they've rebuilt their forces.
Additionally, Ukraine is kicking Russia's ass.
Ukraine has taken back significant parts of territory occupied in early 2022, and is threatening to retake territory occupied in 2014.
These two factors make any cease-fire with Russia a poor strategic decision.
If the war continues on it's current trajectory, Russia's negotiating position will only deteriorate.
If Russia pulls out, Russia's negotiating position will be severely weakened.
It’s more Putin than Russia which is in trouble.
Maybe now it looks the same but hopefully not in the future.
And it would be more wonderful if they would just leave so people would not be killed anymore, even if Russia didn’t get consequences.
It's a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation.
Russia is between Scylla and Charbodis.
The irony is it's Russia that put themselves there.
Not quite.
All the stuff Putin wants is in the areas he's already taken (natural gas, resources, water, land bridge to Crimea, etc...).
Go look back to the day the war started, everyone was predicting that he was going to take this exact area, not the entire country, as he didn't really need the rest of Ukraine (except as a trophy).
It's no wonder Russia has pulled back to this area - the east is the area he wants.
He's defending the area he wants right now.
He'd be happy if Ukraine made a deal with him that allowed him to keep it all.
