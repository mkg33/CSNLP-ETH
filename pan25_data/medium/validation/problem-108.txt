Oh damn yeah my understanding is property is not cheap in Nashville.
We did our guys trip in Nashville in 2019 and the house we stayed at was worth like $600,000.
It was owned by a former Philly resident who moved there.
It was in east Nashville.
Property in general is too expensive anywhere now.
This isn’t sustainable.
You’ve had too many large companies buying up property only to jack up rents.
it’s wild out there.
I paid $125,000 for my house in 2010 and I’d be screwed now.
We’re getting a lot of people buying and moving to Philly from NYC bc they’re priced out.
In general, be courteous to others.

Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
