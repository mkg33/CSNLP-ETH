That and there are settlements on top of it.
Istanbul probably has so much underneath it but we will never know without destroying homes and businesses.
From what I understand this is the major hindrance to having a more comprehensive subway system there.
Every time they dig anywhere itâ€™s enough to start a museum.
There is such scans, like ones which is used to find oil and gas, but using such technology on random places and expecting to find something it is very very expensive.
Not to mention that machines for scanning deep under the earth are big plus it requires a lot of work to create a clear image of scanned area.
If it wasn't such expensive procedure we would be discovering ancient stuff day after day.
I did not mean laser scan, But sound wave scanner, those type of machines are used to scan deep underground.
I don't know where you found a joke, but there is such technology which gives a clear image of what is underground without even digging.
In the Roman Forum there was a random door on the side of a building about 20 feet up.
Some time in the dark ages people expanded back out through the city and found these walls sticking out of the ground so they added a door and roof and made it a church.
Then eventually we find out there's more stuff under all these walls and now the entire Roman Forum is unearthed.
It's super interesting and pretty amazing to see in person.
Really makes you realize just how freaking old Rome is.
Kind of, yes.
I learned when I went to Rome that after the fall of the Roman Empire that the cities population declined drastically.
Large portions of the city were then left uninhabited and over hundreds of years floods and the like covered over the ruins.
