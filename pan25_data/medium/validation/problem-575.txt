The water rights to the Colorado have been an issue since the settlement of the West began and the way this has been handled is testament to how.much of a disaster it can be when individual states "work things out" without a federal apparatus to manage things.
This crisis has been known to be coming for decades now, and the voters have continued to elect people at a local and state level whose plan has been to hope something good might happen on its own.
Audubon outlines some of this on their own site but the relevant quote is: "Part of the reason more water users are not cutting back is because of the current way water is managed.
Water management in the Colorado River Basin is based on a seniority system of water rights.
First come, first served.
This means those with junior rights would have their water reduced completely before a senior water rights holder would see their water reduced at all.
While this has been the way the system has operated for more than 100 years, it is wearing thin in the face of 20+ years of drought and a shrinking river.
In the 1960s, Arizona accepted junior priority rights on a portion of its Colorado River water in exchange for federal funding for the Central Arizona Project (or CAP, the 336-mile long canal that delivers Colorado River water to the central, populous parts of the state).
As such, Arizona has stepped up and taken water cuts, sooner than originally anticipated.
That’s a good thing.
But if Arizona is forced to bear the entire shortage burden in the Lower Colorado River Basin, the impacts to millions of people, including vulnerable communities, will be considerable.
".
And there are “imaginary gallons” in the water rights.
Someone said “that’s not enough” so they just added in water that never existed.
It’s an epic cluster @?
@.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
After: 500 water rights holders get 1.5m gallons, 1m actual = everyone who had junior water rights just took a 33% cut so the new guy could get some.
There's a self righteous part of me that says "you reap what you sow," but the numerous sovereign indigenous tribes in the area who also rely on the Colorado did not sow this, and as the river dries up they are going to be among the hardest hit.
I’m sure that’s not accidental, it’s probably a way to erode existing junior water rights holders to slide in some additional parties without having to actually go after the senior water rights which would trigger a fight with well-connected people.
The whole system just needs to be reworked according to the needs of people and not just commercial operators, and to knock down some of the people with long-term rights who haven’t had to reduce their usage at all while everyone else is rationing toilet flushes.
Truckers pay basically nothing and we’re all subsidizing them.
If I had a choice I’d subsidize rail instead, at least for long haul.
One semi truck is literally thousands of times the wear of a passenger vehicle.
It’s the fourth power of axle weight or something like that.
Also speed is a huge factor, keep ‘em to 25 and they’re not bad, crank at 75 yeah you’re tearing the shit out of the road.
I tend to agree with you that the subjects of this particular article are people who should have gotten a grip years ago and either voted for effective water management strategies or moved the hell away.
Unfortunately, this particular issue is just the tip of the iceberg (no pun intended) and just a harbinger of more pain to come.
And a lot of the people who will be in harm's way because of poor management of this resource are people who can't actually go anywhere without giving up their already limited sovereignty.
I feel like the chances of people in that part of the country having a working familiarity with the music of Philly's favorite sons is slightly less than the chance they'd elect effective politicians prepared to make tough choices, so...negative chances.
"All [they] need to do is form a water district"=political issue, especially given the article addresses this and the political failure of their attempts to do so.
You're the second person so far who has been really intent on denying politics have anything to do with this when there are current, modern examples just down the metaphorical street from Arizona of municipalities taking direct political action to address these consequences and a long history of Arizona voters preferring that their governments pretend there is nothing that can be done.
Take a look at the original water compact which established the deeply political framework of water rights all along the Colorado River, compare the histories of the populations and their governments alongside that river, and then come back and say politics has nothing to do with what's happening.
Or, just take a look at one particular city that proves when there is political will to change things things can be changed:
Or there are the big green corn deserts.
Corn everywhere but not an ear you can actually eat.
Endless acres of corn optimized to be made into food additives, ethanol, etc.
Nothing in those fields will be served up for dinner until industrial processes turn it into something that is pre-packed and “edible.”.
