maybe you misinterpreted what i was saying but from my pov it isn’t done “on purpose” by both sides in the manner of some type of conspiracy theory.
but if you’ve bought into the argument that the 2 sides are the same and are going to compare actively hating minorities and taking peoples rights away with whatever the other side does then i dont think it matters.
But from where i stand they (GOP, Trump, etc) very obviously project as if its a strategy they actively use to make themselves look less toxic and extreme.
Also, your comment about moderates being dumb is way off base imo, not sure where u are trying to go with that.
