The real improvement here is a safety improvement, in reducing the toxic gases within our homes.
Nobody wants asthma.
It's not really pain-free, though, as people really like their gas cooktops.
The emissions improvement will be a rounding error, as you say.
There's no gain at all in switching from a natural gas stove to an electric stove powered by a natural gas power plant.
And then you have the emissions of making, shipping and installing new stoves.
So, a short term loss, to be made up in places served by solar and hydro and such which should improve over time.
All told, any actual emissions reduction will take many many years.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
