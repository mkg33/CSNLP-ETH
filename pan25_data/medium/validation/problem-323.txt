There’s a great line from the YouTube series “The Alt-Right Playbook.” Essentially, the creator says that, fundamentally, fascists aren’t authoritarians, monarchist, socialists, democracy advocates or anything else.
They’re “Whatever puts them in power-ists.” Fascists will absolutely use democracy to elevate themselves to power if they can.
But because their chosen model of government is designed to benefit a handful of people while the rest suffer, and no one is allowed to improve their position, authoritarianism is the only way they can maintain their power.
Hence the above story.
That's the republican way.
Democracy only matters to them when they know the result is in their favor.
They want fascism guised with the illusion of democracy so when they exert their powers and demonstrate their cruelty, they can victim blame and say their acts are a mandate from the people or its the will of the people or some bullshit line like that.
Democracy isn’t a governing principle to conservatives, it’s just a means to an ideological end.
It’s dressing.
If it can no longer give them that end they’ll cut its throat.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
This will blow up in their face, as usual.
The last two elections for Republicans have been pathetic, embarrassing affairs.
Millennial’s and Gen Z turn out more and more every election, and both generations a vastly, overwhelmingly, Dem/Prog/Lefty.
That’s two generations of voters who hate the Republican Party and their policies.
Gen Z is even more Left-leaning than Millennials, if you can believe it.
Republicans offer nothing of value to what is now the largest voting bloc in America, and it shows.
All this and similar policies will do is galvanize young people against Republicans more and more.
Every year that goes by “conservative” fits less and less as a moniker of what they are anymore.
They’re autocrats.
“Conservatism” is just the sheepskin the wolves wear.
Sounds nice and quaint.
