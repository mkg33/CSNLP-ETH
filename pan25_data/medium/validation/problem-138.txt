There's a nice dilapitated house near me that has particle board / plywood signs that he is constantly re-doing for Trump's eventual reinstatement.
First it was Trump 2021, then he made a 2022 sign, now he has a 2023 sign AND a 2024 sign.
My favorite is that he spray paints the actual letters horribly off center on the plywood and each one is different, so there are just these bowed off center hand painted signs claiming Trump is coming back at any time.
