It’s not so much about differences in policy as it is keeping the power of the incumbent, because it is real.
He’s already shown his ability to listen to progressives and act on issues like student loan forgiveness (take it up with the Roberts court), federal marijuana policy, and reshaping the judiciary with a diverse bench.
But it’s also important to remember that Biden’s electability came from his appeal with independents.
Left wing allies in Congress are important, but the ideal presidential candidate is someone who can answer the calls of progressives while still winning over moderates and independent voters in a general election like Biden did.

Biden has been a good president, and while I would like a younger one I’m not going to trade that for his incumbency advantage.
If he’s good to run again I’ll support him.
