>The UNHCR said that it had activated a Refugee Coordination Model in support of the government’s efforts with an established inter-agency coordination working group led by UNHCR, focusing on protection, education, basic needs, health, and socio-economic inclusion.
The number sounds like a total so probably includes people entering from the south via Turkey (ie North Africans, Afghanis, etc), not only Ukrainians.
And it may be that they’re just not assessing the applications that quickly—or that more may end up being granted protection over time.
Edit: I imagine the Ukrainians seeking asylum have their applications accepted very quickly because the situation in Ukraine is clear to everyone, whereas those coming from the south are subject to lenhier processes to determine where they’re coming from and what the substance of the claim is.
There’s probably also a bit racism at play here.
Aside from Ukrainians being white and Christian, there is also a large ethnic bulgarian population in Ukraine.
These are probably the people most likely to head to Bulgaria and there is (some) support for them to be protected.
Also there’s likely more funding attached to dealing with the influx of people from Ukraine, whereas no change on the ongoing chronic situation from the south.
That's pretty reassuring from the perspective of knowing older people eventually do tire out, even if the media doesn't always portray it sympathetically just my take.
