Including forced quarantine?
Forced separation of children from their parents?
At some point foreigners were totally barred from certain places like malls, hotels and restaurants, no matter how long they stayed in China?
Because they implemented (more or less) the same safety procedures for ALL passengers arriving from china as China currently has for everyone.
Not to mention that China (for the vast part of the past 3 years) forced all arrivals to wear epidemic suits and put them for a week or two into isolation.
Chinese government needs to show bravado in front of its people.
It's part of their schtick: "You may be poor and living a shitty life but your country's super amazing and beat the crap out of other countries."
We are talking about a country whose state news agency's nightly news would update US covid death count each day just to show how how successful their zero covid policy has been.
And will always repeat over and over how they have the 2nd highest GDP in the world.
So when countries start demanding covid tests and quarantines, there has been a huge uproar that Chinese people are "getting bullied abroad" hence they need to make a statement by responding in kind.
And this is it.
