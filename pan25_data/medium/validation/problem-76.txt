Wait what?
Prawn cocktail crisps are actually ketchup flavour?
As a Brit, who has consumed her body weight in crisps through the years, I am stunned by this revelation.
If you don't give her enough Lay's you may just Ruffle her feathers or cause a Pringle in her Fritos.
That wouldn't be Funyun or Wise.
So stop being a pUtz and set the mood, light a fire, so she can kick back, prop her legs up, and enjoy her Tostitos.
Can't wait for Gwynneth Paltrow's Bathwater Flavored Kale Mix.
("Get it, it's like trail mix, but it's like assorted dried vegetables, sunflower seeds, and my personal essence!
").
Oooh have you seen District 9?
It's about Prawns, Mark Very powerful, very powerful.
Not like the little prawns that are swimming around like a little prawn.
I need to buy some for “research purposes” and double check!
Actually though I did think to myself last time I had some that they don’t taste like a prawn cocktail, but wasn’t sure what they tasted of.
I put this down to living in a country where they don’t sell them unless they are in the international section of the store.
(Which is very rarely) So I just assumed my taste buds had changed since I left the UK.
