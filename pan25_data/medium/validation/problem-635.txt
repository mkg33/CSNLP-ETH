Why is this the prevailing opinion on Reddit when it is so obviously not true?
The standard bearers of traditional media are less apt to editorialize headlines or resort to name calling but they have been absolutely excoriating on the proven activities of the right.
A preponderance of what we know about their misdeeds is still coming from the NY Times and Washinon Post.
NYT wrote that huge expose on George Santos and this week shredded Bill Barr and his special counsel.
They exposed Stellar Wind and rain the OpEd on yellowcake from Niger.
The MSM has been absolutely heroic in the last 20 years.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
