Great.
We paid for a WNBA player who actually possessed a substance that was illegal in both Russia and the US with a guy who was one of the most wanted people in the world, whose nickname is the Merchant of Desth.
What will we have to pay for a guy who is allegedly a spy?
The Griner for Bout trade seems completely one-sided and screams that the US is not the powerhouse it once was or pretends to be.
I’m happy for her friends and family and I’m sure I would want that trade made if in her or their shoes, but it doesn’t seem like it was the right call from a national perspective.
