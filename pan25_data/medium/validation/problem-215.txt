I have heard it all before.
I have never heard an argument against abortion that is morally, logically, or scientifically correct or valid.
For example, the main argument is that abortion is murder or killing.
This is based on misinformation that the fetus is a living being or a baby.
There is other misinformation spread such as the fetus can feel pain or emotions.
Whether someone wants to believe it or not, science does not support either argument.
There are many studies examining these argument points.
I really recommend you read them, they're very informative.
I can link some if you like.
E.g.
if a fetus were able to feel pain it would need to be 26+ weeks developed.
Even then it is a bit unclear because consciousness is required to actually experience and process pain.
This is all based on research, not just opinion or people's feelings.
Like I said, I'm happy to provide links, but it is pretty easy to find scientific studies if you google 'can the fetus feel pain' and go to reliable research articles.
Every time there is a major data breach the media spins up to speed and talks primarily about the hackers, we get it they are criminals.
Itâ€™s a gaslight.
