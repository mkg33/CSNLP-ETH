Self checkout still requires employees to monitor and help customers, it just requires less of them.
In a different economic system that would be a good thing, and that's my point.
Our system is built backwards in this regard.
Innovations that require less labor and increase productivity don't actually benefit the people who are doing the labor or being productive.
Instead, it just allows employers to extract more money for their labor, while leaving more people out of work.
If we want to solve that problem, discouraging or banning systems that reduce the need for labor is looking at it from the wrong end.
It can be band-aid on the problem, but it doesn't address what's causing the bleed in the first place.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
