DeSantis will not challenge Trump for the 2024 nomination.
If the Democrats are smart they will start planning now for a trump run.
They need a strategy to beat him.
I've said this before, during the 2016 primaries Trump's opponents took him lightly.
When they realized that was a mistake it was too late.
Hillary Clinton did the same thing in the 2016 general election.
For 2024 I do not think that Joe Biden is a viable candidate.
I do not know who else the Democrats have except I keep thinking of Hillary Clinton possibly being wiser in 2024 than she was in 2016.
