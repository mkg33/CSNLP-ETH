> In a statement at the end of financial leaders' meet near Bengaluru, India said the statement condemning Russia's war was endorsed by all members except Russia and China.
It's against India's policy to do so.
If this resolution was about US during their illegal invasion of Iraq, India still would have abstained.
And you seem proud of the fact that you don't care, what does that say about you as a human being for not caring about the destruction Russia is causing ?
Just like Putin?
Let me guess he condemns the war again ?
Maybe the BS is bought by internal audiences, but not elsewhere.
Just the other day Modi / India had a chance at UN, but abstained.
That speaks clearly where he stands and no amount of spinning will change that.
They can and do talk about themselves in the first person all the time.
Top ministers do this all the time when representing their country.
Whataboutism leads to no where and people see through these "condemn the war" statements.
India is aligned with Russia as is its prerogative, but do not expect not to be criticized for it.
What Russia is doing is unequivocally wrong and should be condemned by everyone.
