She did not lie, she joined the blue dog democrats in 2014, in 2013 was advocating for border security and making immigrants learn english.
In 2018 she ran on being an Independent Democrat and voting against the party.

Good.
Sinema lied to the people of Arizona, she doesn't deserve a second term.
Gallego seems like a great candidate with a strong legislative track record.
One third of Arizona voters are Independents, Ruben Gallego has Arizonas 3rd congressional district, which is basically just the city of Phoenix.
His politics dont align with the rest of the state which are primarily conservative, Voters are not going to elect him.
He would be a bad candidate to put up against Sinema.
Telling the state you’ll go to the senate and fight for an increase to the minimum wage and then voting it down once you’re elected is… lying.
>The Senate should hold an open debate and amendment process on raising the minimum wage, separate from the COVID-focused reconciliation bill.
The 15 dollar minimum wage was an amendment to the much larger 1.9 Trillion dollar COVID bill, our inflation has been caused by spending and the Fed growing our money supply by Trillions of dollars over what we needed for the coronavirus stimulus.
Her recent actions and recent statements do not conflict with her prior statements on the minimum wage.
First, you claim she didn’t lie.
Now, you’re saying her lying isn’t that bad.
Next thing you know you’ll be telling me it’s okay for her to lie because everybody else does.
And this is the big Gotcha!
moment?
Constantly moving goalposts doesnt help the position that Sinema lied about anything or misrepresented who she was to Arizona voters.
So, increasing the minimum wage is wrong because it wasn’t a clean bill, but forgiving all PPP loans is okay?
I moved back on topic, and explained that the $15 minimum wage bill was apart of a significantly larger bill.
And gave context.
You are putting words in my mouth.
She didnt lie.
You moved the goalpost with something unrelated.
Shes bringing in money and jobs to the state and a wastewater treatment plant.
She never stated that she was opposed to the $15 minimum wage hike.
She wanted to cut the covid bill down, if you remember.
