A few years ago I worked packing items for Amazon during the Christmas season through an outsourced employer.
A thing that really sucks in working for them is that your performance is recorded by automatic systems.
While there is a lot of demand for products almost no one is fired, even if their performance is low.
Once the season is over, the demand drastically decreases: there are just not that many objects to pack and everyone's productivity decreases as well.
Then they start firing everyone because their productivity is low.
For me it was fine to be fired like that.
I expected it, but others were sad about it.
Working with automatically-recorded metrics is super stressful because those metrics can be used as an excuse to fire people whenever Amazon wants.
They could just be honest from the beginning and tell everyone we just need you for a couple of months.
It's interesting to hear how things have devolved at Amazon.
I've done picking and packing gigs there over the Christmas period about 10 years ago and it wasn't awful.
Hard work but nothing too crazy.
They would track how many items you picked/packed in an hour but that was about it.
It sounds much worse there these days.
