A Florida lawmaker who authored the state’s law banning classroom discussion of gender identity and sexual orientation in elementary school was indicted Wednesday on federal money charges related to COVID relief loans.
Florida House Speaker Paul Renner said Harding was being removed from his committee assignments “to allow him time to focus on this matter.” Renner also indicated Harding wouldn’t be removed from office before a verdict.
Joseph Harding was indicted for money laundering, wire fraud, and making false statements, and faces up to 35 years in prison if convicted.
If the alleged fraud ends Harding’s time in office, his legacy will be contributing to the nationwide surge of state legislation targeting the queer and transgender community, and especially LGBTQ youth and their families.
More than a dozen states considered legislation modeled after the Parental Rights in Education Law that Harding helped shepherd through this year, according to NPR, and more are likely to follow when legislatures resume their sessions in the new year.
