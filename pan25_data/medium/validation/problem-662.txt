But lets say no one will invade sure ok, Lets let the US assume all the debt for saying they wll protect japan and not let them lift a finger to defend themselves because of a war fought 75 years ago and a constitution made out of fear not practicality.
I feel like it is really contradictory to anything I have ever seen or heard having living in Japan for years.
Its more like the culture of sexual shame is the problem there.
Its not worth having sex if it will ruin your life.
Where did you get your information on that?
Because it really contradicts my studies as well the lack of such shame in my countless conversations with Japanese people.
Why and/or how are their views on dating pretty bad?
Well, I would say that I have know some women who prefer not to talk about their relationship status at work, but they don't care outside of work, but the majority of women I have met have been very open about having or not having significant others.
Have I spoke to men that see hookers?
Sure, but I don't like that kind of man very much, and I try to avoid that kind of person.
