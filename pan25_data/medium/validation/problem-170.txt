might see him again though -- feels like each of their army leader generals gets multiple turns to be leader because Gerassimov kind of already was leading this war sitting with Shoigu at the other end of that longgggish table from Putin a while back...
Which is fucking ridiculous that the US wants to dictate who is and is not a legitimate target.
This war has already escalated all it can except for nukes and Russia has already tried to assassinate Zelenskyy multiple times.
I get that warmongering is not the right way either but at some point you need to level the playing field.
You are correct.
The US discovered where he would be and did not share it with Ukraine because they didn't want to escalate the situation by killing a senior leader at that level.
However, Ukraine discovered on their own where he would be and prepared a strike package.
The US told Ukraine not to hit his position, but Ukraine supposedly received the message "too late" to call it off.
Oh, he will be in the news again soon enough.
Probably will be about how he tragically fell from 30 stories for a 3-story building after shooting himself a dozen times in the back of his head.
Truly tragic.
