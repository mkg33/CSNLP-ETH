Nobody here on r-Politics was ever going to give these guys an inch of wiggle room, the sins of the Republican party are older and deeper than just Donald Trump, but these days even recent news bears repeating.
This is a friendly reminder that Donald Trump held hostage American military aid for Ukraine and refused to release it unless Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced a phony investigation into his Democratic presidential opponent, then incited a violent mob to sack Congress while it was in the process of certifying Joe Biden's victory in the Presidential election, a mod that every Republican in the House and Senate was witness to first hand.
Republicans are only dumping Trump now because now he's an electoral liability to them, when he was an asset they were all too happy to protect and defend him.
Trump just talked; but people like DeSantis and MTG will actually go and round up gays and put them in camps.
