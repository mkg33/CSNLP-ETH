Oh yeah that’s right, nothing short of being the countries statistically with the highest per capita amount of constant war/civil war/sectarian violence, political corruption, ethnic cleansing, poverty, famines, terrorism, crime rates, beheadings, stoning, burnings, looting, shootings, rape, killings and stealings for the ongoing past 5000 years.

Religion has done nothing to make these countries better, more often that not, it is a contributing or direct cause of these problems that have made the living conditions of the people in these countries worse.
