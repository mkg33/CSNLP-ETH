The best experience I ever had at a Hooters was when I went with a guy who was a regular.
The waitress came to our table, saw the guy and just plopped down in the seat next to him and started to complain about work - just completely stopped the act.
It was the most real I have ever seen a worker at Hooters act.
Very memorable.
Again, same as homosexuality.
If you can have a picture on your teachers desk of your wife and family as a hetrosexual person, then there's literally no reason to deny the same for a homosexual person as being homosexual is no more sexual a state than hetrosexual is, and that's it in a nutshell.
You can't define a innocuous concept as sexual in one context and not in the other when they are literally the same thing to kids.
No kid is going to question a same-sex spousal relationship unless they are raised by bigoted parents who have quite literally indoctrinated them into rejecting the very existence of homosexuality.
Which hello... talk about literally doing the thing you're accusing everyone else of doing, commonly known as projecting?
