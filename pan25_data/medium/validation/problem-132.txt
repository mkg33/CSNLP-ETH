India likely figured that they could get a very good deal on all the R&D Russia has done for this stillbirth of a tank and developed their own model much cheaper and faster than they otherwise would have been able to.
With a little luck they can even export the result to countries that would no longer want to buy Russian now.
They’re leveraging their future in a desperate attempt to keep things running right now today.
These aren’t advantages they’re bargaining for, its lifelines.
The ones with the actual fingers on the button will.....probably not want to burn themselves along with their families and friends because their boss is scared that his 'friends' will kill him.
Yup and I’m afraid of what happens then.
No way Putin goes quietly and his position of power is precarious enough that a major defeat like this puts him at risk.
I don’t like the idea of a desperate cornered psychopath with the authority to launch nukes.
Personally my hope is someone else in Russia takes him out before it gets that far and blames this whole disaster on him as an excuse to deescalate.
That’s best case scenario IMO.
I said the only way this ends is if Putin get snuffed out by his own people.
Shits getting worse if he's making such desperate moves.
Times ticking for him.
The tank itself is not bad.
The problem is that Russia can't build them in numbers.
They have like three of them to show off on parades and that is it.
The whole business relied on being able to sell tanks aboard in order to make some for Russia itself.
Now the whole tanks made in Russia thing is no longer a thing anyone wants and they are left with a tank that is really good on paper, but doesn't really exist in real life.
