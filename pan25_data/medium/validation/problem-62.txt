Russia over producing oil and can't sell enough of it so the supply cut should not matter other than markets are completely corrupt with ridiculous speculation fraud.
Price is set by OPEC and supply and demand.
When the Saudis reduced supply the price skyrocketed and when Saudi resumed supply OPEC kept the price high.
The same thing will happen here.
Price is based on supply and demand.
A cut in supply with the same demand will increase prices even if it’s based on speculation fraud misjudging the supply the increase in price will happen thus more money per gallon sold.
On top of that ideally China and India would stop being idiots and opportunistically buying more oil than they need because they think they're getting a deal when they are probably more like trading their country's future for relatively tiny savings on oil.
This is 2023, It's the age of the internet and like the global citizen so things like your National brand matter more than ever and the long-term hit against India and China for sucking Putin's cock is going to for a couple decades and I suspect it will exceed the value of the savings on Russian oil.
Probably you're talking about hundreds of millions of consumers that now want to avoid China and India... All for a short term savings on extra oil they mostly didn't need.
And what about the countries that are going to be replaced by the European nations as customers?
1.1 million bpd is not nearly enough to sustain them all.
How much are those other suppliers increasing production by?
Also, India is selling on some of the refined Russian oil to the US and European nations.
The imports went up, you can search up the exact figures if you care about it.
As long as India and China are buying under the price cap, it’s fine, Russia is losing its profits.
