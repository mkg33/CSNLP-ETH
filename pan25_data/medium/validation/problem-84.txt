Since 2016 there's a rise in religious conservatism here, and the conservative party had been pushing this to be included in the revised criminal code (for years, our criminal code is pretty much a translation of the Dutch criminal code imposed upon us when they were our colonizers, so there had been an attempt to make a revised criminal code of "our own making.
").
How will this law be enforced, is yet to be seen tho, so it's not like Indonesia would turn into Iran overnight.
Many activist groups here had been protesting because of the potential misuse.
But since the conservative parts of our society outnumber these activist groups by much (and are more willing to do massive protests that blocked major streets), it is unsurprising that the government wanted to give these groups some concessions (the conservative party is currently the opposition party).
The progressive activist groups are pretty insignificant politically.....
The more problematic parts are about religious criticisms, criticisms against government, president, national principle and demonstration rights.
But I wonder why Redditors are so focused on "no sex in Bali" instead of those?
Going to be pretty funny to see folks put their foot in their mouth when the tourism impacts become clear.
Nobody wants to visit a boring ass society that imposes dated morality on them.
I'm willing to bet that most of the people who would be negatively affected by tourism impacts are those who are opposed to the law.
I don't know Indonesia well, but if their conservative/progressive divide is similar to western countries, it's the poorer rural/farm areas that support this law and will see limited consequences from it... any of which will quickly be forgotten by their belief that God is a bit happier now.
If we see into the actual example set by the Prophet during his lifetime on how to enforce the extramarital sex laws, we would see how actually it is almost IMPOSSIBLE to enforce the law.
The Prophet ruled that to convict someone of extramarital sex, there need to be 4 witnesses that witnessed the penetrative sex act directly (not through a video recording, said by one scholar i listened to), the 4 witnesses should witness the penetration CLEARLY happening (so 4 people watching 2 naked people on top of each other in a room wouldn't qualify as a witness if they don't see the cock going in), all 4 had to witness it with both of their eyes at the same time.
If any of these almost impossible condition was not fulfilled, then those witnesses would be punished by lashings for they are now guilty of being a false witness, and they would forever be banned from being a witness in any legal case.
Such strict, almost impossible conditions to convict someone of zina (extramarital sex) lead to only 3 convicted cases during the Prophet's lifetime, all coming from self confessions out of guilt.
Even on those cases, the Prophet (PBUH) challenged the confessions, searching tirelessly to make those confessors retract their confessions / invalidate the confessions ("are you not insane?
Are you fully aware?
Etc.
Etc.")
The Prophet doesn't give an example of trying to preemptively find people guilty of zina and convict as much of them as possible.
As a Moslem, it saddens me that Moslem nowadays are often times overzealous in wanting to punish those who are guilty, that they forsake the technicalities and examples set by the Prophet in enforcing these laws.
Spying on your neighbor, trying to seek fault in your neighbor is something discouraged by the Prophet, yet somehow it felt like many Moslem nowadays are itching to stone those who commit sins without remembering that we are supposed to be merciful.
You could replace "Moslem" with "Christian" and "prophet" with "Jesus," and your statement would accurately address today's Christians as well.
The reasons behind this could be discussed for hours, but honestly I think a lot of it comes down to a perceived need to "prove" one's devotion to a cause, as if being religious requires that you persecute others to prove your religious-ness.
Oh without doubt there's a lot of "religious" people out there who's only real interest in religion is the justification it provides to actions unrelated to actual "professing" of the faith - i.e., Christian God is probably less interested in your political activities than whether or not you show up to Church to worship him each week.
As far as the reasons why people want to be cruel and control bodies/personal lives of people, for the most part I think it's just projection/compensation - if you have desires you can't obtain and/or are jealous of what other people have, ruining it for other people is the closest thing you'll get to fufilling that desire yourself... just like if a jealous neighbor were to wreck your car simply because they couldn't stand living next to someone who has a nicer car than they could ever afford.
Nowadays, majority of Chinese Indonesians zoomers can't even speak a lick of Mandarin (or other dialects) and don't really participate in Chinese cultural events bar Chinese New Year, especially of those who converted to Christianity from Confucianism or Buddhism.
Chinese Indonesians are like amongst the 5th biggest Chinese diaspora on the planet lol.
They also virtually control of like 80% of Indonesia economy despite being only about 3-4% of the population.
Why do they don't want to live there as majority of them are rich as fuck in Indonesia and have pretty secure lives in their enclaves?
I myself is a Chinese Indonesian and content to live here.
Yes, there are discrimination against the Chinese here and there but there's no different in magnitude as the ones in US are experiencing right now (not systemic discrimination).
Islam spread peacefully through trade and assimilating local culture before the Dutch came.
Many local kings converted into Islam and their kingdoms became sultanates.
