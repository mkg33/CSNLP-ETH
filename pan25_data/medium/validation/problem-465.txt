I’ve seen a video about it in London but it was from several years ago.
Apparently there was a neighborhood with a heavy Muslim population and some of the imams tried to declare sharia law there.
I don’t think anything came of it though.
However I’m more concerned with Muslim immigrants doing things like honor killing their daughters or gay sons, which is something that happens all over the west.
How dare they not accept every single person flooding to their borders, claiming to be a refugee?
/s.
Its beyond football.
Have you seen the videos where the immigrants turned into gangs and hold parts of EU cities hostage with violence proclaiming turf with Sharia law?
Perhaps if any of the middle eastern countries (especially the very wealthy ones, ahem Saudi Arabia) - would take more than 0 refugees per year there wouldn’t be such a catastrophic situation.
So much for the Quran calling to help others in need…I guess it’s only when they benefit you.
Maybe if they behaved better and didn’t tear down their host cities because of football (looking at you Moroccans) the EU would be more willing to accept them.
