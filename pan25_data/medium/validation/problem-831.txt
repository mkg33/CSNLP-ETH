Already seeing the usual intentionally misunderstanding comments.
A minority of people refused to wear masks so an entire group was kicked off including those wearing masks.
That’s a bullshit policy.
“It’s Jews coming from JFK.
Jewish people who were the mess, who made the problems,” the supervisor said on the video, which Dan’s Deals shared shortly after the incident.
> That date was when airline agents in Frankfurt barred many Jewish travelers coming from New York City from boarding their connecting flight to Budapest, citing the fact that some of the passengers were not wearing masks, as was required at the time.
But that rule was applied inconsistently, passengers said at the time, and a Lufthansa supervisor was caught on video speaking disparagingly about Jewish passengers as a group.
Even if it were any other group, since in Europe are pretty good - but this against a Jewish group is extra bad PR.
With such a comment,l totally see why they would just pay them to avoid further embarrassment.
Not only they did not consistently enforce the rules but we got the supervisor blaming 'jewish people' for the the problems.
Any German court would have sided with the Jewish group immediately.
So damage control through some quick compensation was the only thing they could do.
Story time, once a flight of mine was canceled on short notice, without any reason given.
To be back for work on time, I had to take longer and much more expensive trains.
I tried to get compensated for that by the airline but they said I wouldn't get anything more than the ticket price.
I asked why the flight was canceled and they said "unforeseen conditions such as high winds ".
That seemed unlikely to me, so I made an official complaint under EU passenger rights.
Turns out the unforeseen consequences were "not enough staff".
Turns out I was entitled to triple the compensation that the reimbursement of the train tickets would have costed them.
Idiots..
