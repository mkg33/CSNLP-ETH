Running out and being out are two different things.
If they started with 50,000 and now have 2,000 they can still be running out and launch a massive attack at the same time.
I read that RU is producing something like 50 new long range missiles per month.
Doesn't sound like a lot to me.
They'll end up at some point having to sit and wait for resupply of just a handful if they keep up this volume of attacks.
Hopefully they completely run out sooner than later.
I suspect they have a pretty large reserve though.
Even though I think Russia is dumb as hell, I don't think they're going to exhaust their entire missile supply on Ukraine and leave themselves defenseless if NATO decides they've had enough.
But they will run Low and it even seem like new batches of munitions are of less quallity than ones before the war.
And even they where pretty shit by Nato standards.
Systems like the german IRIS-T for example seem to have a 100% Hit ratio so they need more missiles to attack then there are missiles to intercept.
