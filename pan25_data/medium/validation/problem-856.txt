Many Cuban’s that came in the boat lift are white from European descendants just like many other white people all over Latin and South America.
Those white people look down upon the native populations and the descendants of the black slaves who were brought to the Americas starting in the 1500s.
If you go to any Latin American country you will find a high portion of the elite and rich are white people who descend from European ancestry and not indigenous or African and they do not intermarry with people they perceive as lower caste due to their skin tone.
I know this won’t be popular but it’s true.
