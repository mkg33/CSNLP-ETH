You should talk to him about having a museum acquire those photos.
The Rape of Nanking is extremely lacking in documentation, to the point that Japan still to this day denies it ever happened.
It is currently against the law in Japan to create memorials for victims of Japanese atrocities, as attested to by the removal of a memorial for "comfort girls," and arrest of the creator a few months ago.
This could be a stepping stone to changing that.
I saw something similar recently.
A pawn shop owner bought a book that had photos of the Imperial Japanese Army in China and Southeast Asia.
Included in it were clear and gruesome photos taking in the Rape of Nanking.
Kristallnacht is the Nazi propaganda name for it.
In Germany we have renamed it Reichtsprogromnacht (because it was a program and not some beautiful crystals in the streets).
Also let's remember please that for the American version, the first line was deleted, since it would've conflicted with the heightening anti-communist propaganda.
