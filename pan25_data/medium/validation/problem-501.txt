16 weeks is 4 months,.
January is over, they will be "trained" by the end of May if the training starts next week, summer starts on June 21st... sooooo I wasn't wrong saying that is not before the summer, even experienced people will have to learn new things, yeah, no need to teach them what a wrench is, bu the engine of an Abrams is not the same as the T72 or whatever they're used to.
That will be many months from now, they need to bring the crews to train them, tank crews, maintenance crews, etc, then they need to get everything there, tanks, parts, ammo, support trucks, etc...
It's goos they will get them, but it won't be before the summer.
To be honest I think the Ukrainians already had the training.
I doubt that USA wasn’t thinking sending Abrams many months before, they just didn’t want to announce not To escalate.
I would go further and even bet that USA is already training Ukrainians to fly the f-16 for 2/3 months already (if not longer).
There was an article in Aug 2022 about the training for F-15's and F-16's they were starting to get, so by now I'm pretty sure there are very capable Ukranians pilots ready to get their planes, I'm sure in the next few months we will be hearing about some planes being sent there.
