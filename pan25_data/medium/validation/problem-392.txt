I'd argue that Trump is that crystallized Republican ideal.
He's the embodiment of everything they're looking for--rich, liar, white, dumb and racist, a gaslighter, obstructor, and projector par excellence.
George Santos defies every attempt at explanation in a way Trump never did--he's not coherent enough as a person to be understood.
When trying to describe him, adjectives fall flat or he runs away from them like he flees a wire fraud charge in Brazil.
He simply lacks the solidity for me to say that he possesses any quality save being a liar, so I can't say he represents any kind of ideal, even the negative ones.
He's too insubstantial for that.
In general, be courteous to others.

For Republicans, finding someone who actually _wants_ to be Speaker is half of the problem.
There is a long list of beat up punching bags that they have left in their wake.
