I wonder if they'll start giving kids non-plastic table utensils at school too?
It would be so terrible if we had to start using what worked fine for 5000 years until the petroleum industry arrived on the planet like a black slime..
I give this "advice" because I know that it's useless to any real plane hijacker.
The 9/11 hijackers were able to take over planes with box cutters because prior to 9/11, the standard was to simply listen to hijackers' demands and fly where they told you to.
That only stopped being a viable defense when the terrorists decided they wanted to fly planes into buildings.
Since then, knives have become useless for actually taking over planes.
Passengers now know that it's best to just bum-rush someone holding a knife; at worst they kill one or two people.
But the alternative is the plane may be flown into a building somewhere.
The only actually meaningful security measure we've implemented post-9/11 is the reinforcement of cockpit doors so you can't just body-slam your way in there.
