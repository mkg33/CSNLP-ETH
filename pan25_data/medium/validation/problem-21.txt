\ other jobs aren't "required" to do it (it's a Chicago law, so they literally have no jurisdiction over what happens in Naperville), but my job already had the 1:40 policy in place years before Chicago made it law, so I figure other companies outside of Chicago have it in place, as well.
As the state with the third largest city in the country (Chicago), you'd think that this would be a no-brainer.
But apparently not.
Yeah, places around Chicago would never be able to recruit if they didn't adapt to the closest major market.
So I'm sure at least in that larger county's area, most people won't be effected by this specific law (which is good because it would mean that companies have already been doing it "voluntarily"!
).
I actually feel like this is a perfect fair and balanced compromise between "NO PAID LEAVE EVER LOL" and "we just want SOMETHING please.
".
Just like "too big to fail" is a recipe for disaster, "too small for your workers to have rights" is also a recipe for disaster.
Yep, Chicago has a law that employees earn 1 hour of sick time for every 40 hours worked.
It's been in place since about 2016 or so.
To the point where I forget it's a city-specific thing, so other jobs in the state aren't required to follow the same policy; let alone other jobs in other states.
Chicago has such a huge working population that any one who doesn't try to take employees out of the city is going to fail pretty quickly in a lot of cases.
I'm sorry but if you can't afford 5 days per year that someone gets, what, 15/hr while they're not working then you haven't adapted to current market conditions and should fail as a business.
I think that this is a totally fair way to get anyone who is a full-time worker SOMETHING without employers being able to claim that their backs are being broken.
While this should not be the end goal, this is a very amazing and positive first step forward!

Please if you have any questions or concerns.
If you need five employees, have five employees, and your business grinds to a halt with four employees, you don't have a well-run business.
This gives a huge amount of people one extra week of paid time off that they otherwise would not have, and that is great news, even if it is only one week off.
