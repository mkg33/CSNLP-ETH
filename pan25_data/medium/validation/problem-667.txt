Ukraine should have every type of weapon and a counter to everything that Russia is attacking them with.
There's no escalation if they only do what Russia does, and they'll be doing much less than that, because they'll be striking at military targets.
>The 11-month war has killed tens of thousands of people, driven millions from their homes, left cities in ruins and shaken the global economy, driving up energy and food prices.
As a german one thing is for sure, if our military industries worked and produced as slow as they work now on AA military systems for Ukraine when our own country was under threat one day, the german public would demand heads to roll.
Imagine a crisis situation in your own country and it takes a company +6 months to assemble a single IRIS-T AA system.
This is what modern Germany has become, there's war on our doorsteps civillians dying every day and people continue to work nine to five as if nothing was going on.
People might come for me from the hedgerows "what do you clown know about producing complex weapon systems...." but i don't give a fudge.
If our government would actually require these companies to put the pedal to the metal to produce 1 system every two weeks given the the required funds and personel were provided, these companies could do it.
As demonstrated with other issues like the HUGE lack of ammunition of all calibres for the Bundeswehr our government still only talk a good game but in reality the "Zeitenwende" hasn't reached our industry at all.
All that my country cares about these days and others like Switzerland for example is to make a good profit no matter who you're dealing with.
Once this war is over german industry representatives will throw themselves into the dirt to Putin's feet again and beg for cheap energy or access to the russian market.
That is what Germany's "Wertegeleitete Au√üenpolitik"(value-based foreign policy) has become in the last 20 years.
Our ever so hungry industries actually run Germany through intermediaries, lobbyists, lawyers and the politicians are mere salesmen and women.
