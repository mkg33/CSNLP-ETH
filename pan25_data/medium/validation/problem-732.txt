The one thing Republicans benefited from this past cycle from abortion bans was that most didn't go into effect yet from pending lawsuits.
Georgia's for example literally was just allowed to stand (pending Georgia Supreme Court ruling) just this past week.
Ohio's was blocked indefinitely in October pending a lawsuit.
Same for Arizona.
They're going to be full blown for 2+ years heading into the 2024 election.

Don't need to.
Extreme abortion bans will stay in the spotlight on their own as women will die every day from lack of adequate healthcare access.
Ectopic pregnancy?
Death.
Miscarriage that doesn't discharge?
Death.
I love that you frame it as women's health.
It's not just our right to abortion, it is having a say in your body choices.
I had terrible periods resulting on monthly hospital visits/stays.
No doctor (male or female), would LET me get a hysterectomy because " I would want children" and the surgery is irreversible.
I had to wait, in agony, until I was considered geriatric pregnancy age to get the surgery I needed.
I never wanted children and couldn't even get through a period without medical intervention...but my choice was never taken into account of what I wanted.
This likely wouldnâ€™t have helped you due to timeframe, but for others reading this with a similar issue, r/childfree has a list of doctors who are more friendly to people seeking sterilization/hysterectomy.
