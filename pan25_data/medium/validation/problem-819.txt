While we’re at it, double fuck Reagan, too.
Those two shitbirds are a large part of the root cause behind the west’s slide into dystopia.
That would imply blocks have been built with substandard fire safety materials for decades.
I find that hard to believe, considering the only catastrophe resulting from it was recent.
In 2021 alone, there were over 500k fires in England.
About 7% of them were fires in buildings, that spread beyond the room they started in (other flats, other floors, or whole building).
I don't know if that's excessive or not, compared to other countries, and compared to buildings with good safety measures & build quality.
But I am guessing only the wildest fires get reported in the news, because there are so many of them.
Perhaps, bad quality buildings have been catching fires excessively for years, but they weren't spectacular enough and/or not enough people were dying to attract the media....??

Yeah, in Texas they often use pressboard shit as siding on a lot of low-end houses.
I think "chicken coop" is my new favorite word for those kinds of houses.
Texas developers definitely cut corners wherever they can.
