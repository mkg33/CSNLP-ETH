I worked with an ambassador to South Sudan from my home country, and their office had the Minster of International Development (in charge of millions of $s in foreign aid being sent there) visit the country.
Set aside a meeting with Salva Kiir’s office for a specific time slot and everything months in advance.
I wouldn't have clicked on the video if he didn't arrest them.
But now I've watched it twice, in detail.
And I will remember him for this moment President of South Sudan you say.
I could not have even said with complete confidence that there was a President of South Sudan, but now that he's arrested them, this glorious moment of comedy now occupies way too many of my brain cells.
Nice going, President Streisand.
You wouldn't have watched a world leader and dictator pee their pants in front of a large crowd unless there were journalists involved?
You are much more mature than I.
Time comes for the Minster to visit, and the President’s office forgot that they were coming.
Thankfully, the Minster wanted to visit Bentiu and Malakal, so that burned a couple days.
Comes back to Juba for the new appointment time, and not only are they not given an official greeting, they are practically harassed for daring to show up.
Made to wait for about 2 hours in a closet-like room, and then finally get the visit for about 15 minutes.
Definitely an interesting time being there.
I had official foreign military badging, and was one of the few permitted to carry a sidearm in public.
Tried to keep to myself in public, but when the people see you as a walking moneybag, you tend to stick out very easily.
