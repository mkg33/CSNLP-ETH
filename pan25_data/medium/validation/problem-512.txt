Joe plays with his dogs and bikes.
Trump parks his golf cart ON the green because he is too lazy to walk.
Trump skipped half of his own golf tournament, gave himself a winning score, and declared his victory was proof of his fitness.
He apparently played a round a few days prior or something, and he just wrote his score in for the holes he missed based on that previous round he played, I'm sure with better scores than he actually shot during that previous round.
But yeah, Trump definitely either made those words up or they were cherry picked for him to get them easily.
He couldn't even get that lie right.

The words they gave me were something like cowboy, sidewalk, birthday things like that.

I would be asked to recite the whole list then just words in one category.
Stroke.

I've lost some dexterity too.
Not a lot but I notice it when working with small parts.
The weirdest thing is I can't type anymore.
I still know what fingers go where but I can't do it.
I'm relearning touch typing.
