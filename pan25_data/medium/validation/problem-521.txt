Even if they came back from commercial, Buttigieg was gone, and Bret was alone, twiddling his thumbs, and made a soft comment about how he had the guest leave because he was smelly, conservatives would still be.
> "Before me, it was the secretary of the army under President Trump who took that trip with his wife.
Before that, it was Mrs. Trump as first lady who went.
Before that, Mrs. Obama did the same thing.
And I guess the question on my mind is, if no one's raising questions about why secretary [Mark] Esper and his wife led that delegation, as well they should have, then why is it any different when it's me and my husband?

Cowardice is one of the few unforgivable sins left among the reich scum.
It’s a big part of why they won’t elect McCarthy - he’s a cuck, and it doesn’t matter how much he bends over for them.
When I look it up, it's because they were both involved in multiple lawsuits, including a $25 million suit they were pulled into from one of their supporters driving their car into a crowd, and then places started distancing from them.

People often talk about all the languages he speaks, I would add that he speaks the language of "the right" as well.
During the primaries he talked often about GOP sounding buzzwords like freedom and security but he reframed them.
Freedom = keep the government out of your healthcare and marriages, freedom to start a new business if you don't have to worry about losing your healthcare.
Security = you are not safe if extreme weather threatens your homes or your livelihood.
People mocked his statement "the shape of our democracy is the issue that affects every other issue" but he was right.
All the structural issues (citizens united, gerrymandering, voter suppression, fillibuster) make meaningful change difficult.
He was also dead right that supreme court reform needs to get started.
He can clearly formulate his thoughts very quickly and spit them out in fully formed paragraphs.
I think it is just a natural ability but being the only child of an English professor and a linguistics professor probably helped as well.
He grew up in and worked as a democratic mayor in one of the reddest states in the country.
He had to work with Governor Pence, for example.
He learned how to talk and work with conservatives.
He had to.
He learned that wagging his finger at them would just shut down conversation and get him nowhere.
He learned how to present fairly progressive ideas in ways that wouldn't immediately get the defences up of people he needed to convince.
Notice how Josh Hawley’s public profile has dropped significantly since the video came out of him running away from the rioters he had hours earlier pumped his fist at in solidarity.
