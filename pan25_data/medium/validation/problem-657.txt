Fried had zero chance of winning.
I’ll say that while I agree with a lot of things she says, the idea of her still upsets me.
She was essentially placed in the commissioner of agriculture position because her significant other has massive holdings in the marijuana industry, and having her in office helped clear the way for that.
The fact she writes her name as Nicole “Nikki” Fried also comes off completely childish.
Call yourself whatever you want, but don’t go with quotes on your business card.
Basically, the fact that she is the best FL has to offer is just sad.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
