Me either but because of that district, their representative, MTG, will play a major role in how the Republicans run the House for the next two years.
Adam kinzinger has said on Twitter she is the silent leader of the party.
At this point she should be considered extremely dangerous given the flex she's made to bend the gop to her will.
QAnon Greene has already established herself as a caucus leader in securing enough votes for Kevin McCarthy's bid for House Speaker which means she'll have broad influence over what legislation gets passed in the House.
Granted Republican's have a very slim majority, but just having to deal with her and his BS for the next two years is already exhausting just thinking about it.
We want government that works for the people.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
How does a nut job like Marjorie Taylor Green get 170,162 Georgia voters to pick HER as their U.S. Congress woman?
Their representative?
I just don't understand.
It was more of a rhetorical question.
Its just a sad reflection of how some parts of our country are just so convinced that fascism and authoritarianism are far better systems of government than democracy and now she will have a large part in what happens in the next Congress when they take over the House in January.
Fortunately, the Dems control the Senate and have the Presidency but that just means we have to put up with another two years of government obstruction and nonsense before we get a chance to vote them out (hopefully) in 2024.
Its just exhausting.
