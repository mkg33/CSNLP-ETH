If you know anything about Indias history and it’s relationship with its Allies - you would know how difficult it would be for New Delhi to do anything about Russia.
When the West was arming (and is still arming) Pakistan to fight the Taliban, it was also arming India’s neighbor.
That was because america was focused on stopping communism and when india had a soviet inspired 5 year plan (that didn't kill off entire hoards of their population) the US saw them as a threat and started supplying the terror but US friendly state of Pakistan.
Then the US defending Pakistans genocide of 2-3 million Bangladeshi's and "declaring all women public property" and sending a fleet to deter India from continuing its liberation of Bangladesh.
Meanwhile the soviets send aid and sent a nuclear sub to prevent the US fleet from doing anything.
No, Pakistan manipulated the US into getting what they wanted.
All the while the cause of 20 years of war (bin Laden) was safely sitting in Pakistan the whole time.
Initially Pakistan denied knowing he was there... but former high ranking cabinet ministers have let it slip that they knew he was there.
Exactly how is "the West" related to this ?
Russia is invading its neighbor, condemning the invasion should not be difficult, failing to do so just helps Russia.
It’s about diplomacy and historical ties.
India has had strong ties with both then Soviet Union and now Russia.
And India relies a lot of Russian military equipment as its surrounding China and Pakistan.
West/US says to condemn Russia, but doesn’t give any evidence that it will aid India if it comes to its only issues.
Rather as recent as last year US has been arming Pakistan with F16s.
Pakistan and India have had armed conflicts what 3 times already?
Seriously; the war is not about India or its history.
India is free to align itself with whoever they want, but clearly what Russia is doing is wrong, they have raped babies FFS, so criticism for the inaction is valid.
Trying to spin it to "but the west" is just sad.
Thanks for the confirmation that you didn’t try to see to it from India’s perspective.
And you are just assuming that your world view is the only one that exists.
On a personal level- the conflict needs to stop.
I 100% want peace in that region or any region.
But like most things in life- I am powerless.
>We must take sides.
Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim.
Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.
There is no video in existence that would justify accepting atrocities.
