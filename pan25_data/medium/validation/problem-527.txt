The Ukrainian military destroyed all 24 Iranian-made kamikaze drones, which Russia used to attack Ukraine overnight.
"On the night of January 26, the Russian occupiers resumed attacks on Ukraine with the Iranian-made Shahed-136/131 kamikaze drones," the report said.
According to preliminary data, the enemy used 24 Shaheds.
All of them were destroyed by anti-aircraft missile units, fighter aircraft and mobile groups of the Ukrainian Air Force, in cooperation with air defense units of other components of the Defense Forces of Ukraine.
"Most kamikaze drones were destroyed in the center of the country -- in the area of responsibility of the Air Command Center," the report added.
Late on Wednesday, January 25, an air raid alert went off in a number of regions in Ukraine due to the launch by Russia of Iranian-made kamikaze drones.
They've been using cheaper defense measures against the Shahed drones.
The Gepard flak cannons as well as mobile teams of heavy machine gun crew have been picking up a lot of the slack on these.
Not sure what the exact ratios of intercepts are but the UA and western support are well aware of the issues of dealing with low cost drones.
It might be a translation issue, but it is specifically noted in the article that drones in this attack were intercepted by missiles.
