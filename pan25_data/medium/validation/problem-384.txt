None of that would stop climate change and would cause billions of people to die, it's a horrible idea.
You can't reduce out of this problem.
It's a long term build-up AND natural interglacial cycle warming combined, it's not just pollution.
Population reduction and just getting rid of fossil fuels is not even, not even close really.
The tragic part about Climate Change is that those with the most power to change things are the ones least affected by it, making change slow and difficult.
ironically we tried that, look at canada.
The truck protest was for arguably all the wrong reasons, but when it was just on the streets in ottawa no one gave a shit at the top levels.
The second they started protesting at the bridges, which was causing millions a day in economic issues, the leaders lost their minds and shut that shit down hard.
Driving costs up kills people faster than climate change, we need solutions to mitigate and regulate climate, not just desperate attempts at reduction that turn the entire world against us.
