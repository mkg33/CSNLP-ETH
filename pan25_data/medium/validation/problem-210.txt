The United States is using sewage water before treatment to screen for community level COVID.
I actually had heard about this in the very beginning.
It's an endothelial attacking disease.
The gut has and abundance of endothelium.
We also know it becomes arosolized with toilet flushing.
It's a thing.
Not doubting it's efficacy.
What I am pointing out is that 1.)
China was also testing foreigners to their land.
And 2.)
In a much more invasive way than is being described now by the west with regards to Chinese arrivals.
Nothing says welcome to our country like a good rectal swab and exam... if that doesn't provide sufficient warning to simply not go, I'm not sure what would.
When Western vaccines were available they failed big time to even take advantage of them to protect their own population.
And, who would even want to visit China right now with the current situation?
I guess maybe some people with family, but otherwise people will likely steer clear.
The rest of the world has been decieved into the false sense of security that we can move on.
The last 3 years was a training exercise and proof of concept.
The coming wave from the wide body flights after the dropping of the lockdowns in China is the real deal.
Only now, the world is in varying stages of zombie plague viral loads that have already obliterated the weak, weakend the average, and rendered the strong average.
Look at the building case counts in the United States and the growth curve that's a 7 day laggin indicator.
Beijing all pissed off the world is fed up with their efforts at biological destruction of the rest of the world.
They have wide body air craft landing in countries testing 50% positive on landing, which means they departed that way, the other 50% will be positive.
Nevermind the 40% false negatives.
Yes, we should be demanding negative tests before departure and if a single person tests positive before disembarking, the plane is told to fly right back to where it came from marked, Refused, return to sender.
