I know you are a different person, but I wanted to push back on the idea that lithium is anymore dangerous than the other options for bipolar.
In fact, lithium is the safest and most effective treatment we have for bipolar.
It’s doesn’t work for everyone but the commenter above doesn’t seem to get that all these medications have serious side effects.
And not taking them can be much MUCH more dangerous to the patient than the long term side effects.
Suicide (depression) or a drunk driving accident (mania) will kill you faster than the side effects.
Especially when you fail to realise most people that say it are just seeking to be part of the social group rather than trying to pass off some sort of uniquely funny joke.
It’s an in-joke.
You know some people have never seen those jokes before right?
Just because you’ve seen them a lot doesn’t mean everyone has.
And doesn’t mean it’s the same people telling them either.
This is just as ignorant as making fun of people marching with "pride" in North Korea.
Those people are hostages.
If they don't say the right thing they might not be heard from ever again.
You'd be screaming just as loud that Russia is winning, if the alternative would be having your family in danger.
