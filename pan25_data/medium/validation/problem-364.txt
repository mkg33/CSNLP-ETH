That’s my understanding.
I think it is important to point out though that it could be enforced through the shipping insurance ships are typically required to have to dock at a port and unload their oil.
This is at least what some other articles I’ve read / videos I’ve watched are saying.
Who is in the business of supplying shipping insurance?
Apparently, it’s generally western countries (like potentially up to 90%).
If this is all true (I assume it generally is, but would like to read more about it), these insurance companies could forbid their insured customers from shipping oil over $30.
Of course, I’m sure it is more complicated than that.
From what I understand, it’s not the oil they’re insuring, it’s the ships and the associated risks with transport/loading.
Of which, a vast majority are owned/insured by western countries, even if they are “flagged” in a country of convenience.
You'd think a country like Russia would just 'self-insure' if western companies backed out...or at least go through frendlier economic territory like China or Iran to get the necessary insurances.
If you tell Russia to get the oil there themselves without western-backed ships, they’re in a bit of a pickle.
Especially considering they already (allegedly) blew up their own pipeline.
But then again, so are places like Germany, who depends heavily on it.
If people freeze this winter, they may lose political support for Ukrainian aid.
Russia needs to keep shipping oil.
It’s not like they can just turn off the taps of the well.
They might be in a take it or leave it scenario.
You are going in the right direction, but for the last year all of the 20 year old oil tankers that are normally scrapped are being bought and floated as "off shore storage".
There are shadow fleets off the coast of Malaysia that are being loaded and unloaded in international waters.
The oil will still ship, just in 20 year old unregistered ships until one sinks.
It’s not all black and white.
When people’s energy bills triple or they face gas/oil shortages, they become a little selfish sometimes.
Unfortunately.
