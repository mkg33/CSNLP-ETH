Turkey is a very self centered country but all things aside they are one of the most reliable NATO allies participating in almost any operation with troops and equipment.
They also form one of the core forces of the Nato response forces and were spearheadig the VJTF up until January 31st 2021.
The VJTF is being led France now until January 31st 2022 (so a few more weeks) after which Germany takes over.
Now that is a moment to be dreaded.
The Bundeswehr is in such a state where there apparently is only enough ammunition for a few hours to days of warfare (the current estimate is that Germany will run out of ammunition after fighting for 2 days) and the German military industrial complex stated they cannot provide ammunition for years to come.
And when I say ammunition I mean all sorts.
From small arms all the to artillery and missiles.
Don't be.
Once Turkey gives its vote, the rest of NATO and the EU have lots of ways to pressure Hungary to give it up.
Hungary doesn't have strategic importance to NATO like Turkey does.
