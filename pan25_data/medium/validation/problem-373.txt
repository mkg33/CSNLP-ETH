Just speculating.
On my commute the other day there was so much water on the freeway I had to go around 45 to keep consistent traction.
Saw quite a few people losing control or crashed on the side of the road.
I was kinda wondering how Davis was.
My mom works downtown there and hasn’t mentioned how much debris there is.
You guys have a lot of large mature trees too so I imagine there’s quite a bit.
Hope your big ones stay up and everyone stays safe.

Imagine walking out of a brick and mortar store and discovering they put a gps tracker on your car while you were shopping, hired someone to follow you around to see which products you look at in other stores, who then followed you home and took pictures through your window to see what you ate for dinner and which book you were reading.
