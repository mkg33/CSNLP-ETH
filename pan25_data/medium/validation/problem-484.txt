Unbelievable on its own and also that the loud mouth russians that want this war are the last, if at all, used to fight this war.
Looks like the Kremlin is not just recruiting , but also foreign nationals who were imprisoned in Russia.
> Nathan Lemekhani Nyirenda, 23, was serving a nine-year prison sentence in Russia after being convicted of drug possession in 2020.
Don't worry, she's going to be wearing the t-shirt she was arrested in, shorts and one sock (all unwashed for months, of course) in 20F weather to balance out.
Anythihg thats a human rights violation, that's just music to russias ears, and they pencil it in ASAP.
That said, the one thing I haven't heard of is women being forced yet.
So does that go for women's prisons too?
I think she's OK right now but Russia is absolutely desperate and I don't put it past them to empty those too soon.
And maybe for roles like trench digging, medic help, idk.
It's Russia, so u never know and don't hold your breath bc they don't do whats right - they just do what they want and what they think benefits them.
