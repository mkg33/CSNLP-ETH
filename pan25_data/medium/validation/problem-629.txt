Itâ€™s very easy to be fooled when you see all that independence and democracy to think they might be independent and democratic.
At the moment it's not looking too hot for the current ruling party which is definitely saddening, because that might make some disgusting populist come into power.
I actually laugh at what an amazing farce the CCP is when it makes statements.
It blatantly, loudly, contradicts itself every single time without fail.
It's genuinely hilarious how deluded they are to think people can't see through their infantile charade.
Yet they keep doing it.
Not even the people of China believe it, even they know that when their government says one thing you should believe the opposite.
No matter how much you lie or how much you threaten people into not questioning it you can't stop their own inner thoughts that tell them you're liars.
The fact is, China, you can't do shit about Lithuania.
You have no leverage.
You blow hot air and Lithuania knows it.
It's the China's Final Warning joke everyone makes about you.
You keep issuing that final warning over and over and nothing happens.
There's no CCP control in Taiwan.
No PLA in Taiwan.
It's called Taiwan, even by the CCP, further stating it's independent.
Taiwan has its own president and it's own elections.
They have their own flag and identity.
