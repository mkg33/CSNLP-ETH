Iâ€™m not sure that is the only way to fix it.
The system as it stands punishes sustainability, favoring approaches like planned obsolescence to keep profits flush.
Sustainability was largely an afterthought in the creation of what we know today.
It is, at least theoretically possible, to apply more sustainable methodology to our existing economy.
Edit: but yeah, the problems we see with capitalism are largely intractable without first developing advanced economic modeling and decision-making software, and only if it's done with equity in mind, and some luck.
The kinds of fundamental economic shifts we want to see would likely result from software that makes it a lot easier for people to manage economic planning and decision-making.
It would analyze a wide variety of data to model and make various extrapolations of the economy, and utility at large, in an effort to optimise utility at some ideal compromise between individual users, each distinct community, and the global population.
The working/consumer class would be well served by a system like this, if it could be made with ethical integrity and relative stability in its results.
