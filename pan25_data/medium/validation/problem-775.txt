Yes he's a dick who got elected to the EP with a satire party called The Party (Die P.A.R.T.E.I.
= Partei für Arbeit, Rechtsstaat, Tierschutz, Elitenförderung und basisdemokratische Initiative; Party for Labour, Rule of Law, Animal Protection, Promotion of Elites and Grassroots Democratic Initiative).
All the French who voted against, are from the Rassemblement National (aka Front National/ Le Pen party).
They are freaking corrupt to the core (and still owe the Russians money btw).
All the other names either belong to extremist right party AfD, who gets funds by the Russian state.
Others are members of Die Linke, the renamed SED, the ruling party of East Germany's communist/socialist dictatorship, pets to the USSR and still thinking that Russia is their protector and will reestablish a communist utopia at some point.
(yes Russia sponsors Nazis and Communists and both of them believe it will help them succeed establish their autocratic dictatorship).
And SPD members, a party who had close ties with Russia at the turn of the millennium and a former chancellor by this party is still best buddies with Putin.
