Same post was removed from r/europe , just try to find this kind of news on some world news site that you know and you'll see that it doesn't exist.
I can't even find much about this in Serbian news because it is fake.
There should be a counter Museum next to it, showing how those perputators that killed that guy with the hammer got vaporized just shortly after by US Forces.
Serbia supports Russia because they’re mad that NATO bombed them to stop then genociding ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
They give Russia a hard pass on Russia asking NATO to stabilise the regions and voting in favor of the UN Security council resolution authorising the action.
Russia now likes to pretend they didn’t do that too to bitch about NATO.
You are taking words from a non-parliamentary ultra right party seriously.
This post had already been removed from r/europe because it is fake.
If you read the article that Ultra right party just said that they would welcome Wagner to Serbia and Wagner immediately posted on telegraph (Putin's propaganda channel).
Serbia as a state and the government didn't call them, they can't even enter Serbia nor create any kind of center here.
