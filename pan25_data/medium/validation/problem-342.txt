While the legal protections in terms of the government and what marriage grants you is good...
But are we sure we want to force people to participate in things that they disagree with religiously, or even if it is something that they don't like?
Since there isn't a problem in finding people to make your wedding website, bake your wedding cake, or anything else like that I can't understand why the government can force you to participate in something you don't want to be part of.
What happens when it is something you disagree with down the line?
My inner libertarian comes out for stuff like this and I can't help but be against anything that forces someone to participate in an activity they don't want to.
Like, just hire someone else.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
