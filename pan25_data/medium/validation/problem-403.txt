The US is helping.
US money and primarily, intelligence, is the single reason Ukraine has turned the tide.
I’m not downplaying European help, at all, the EU has contributed a lot.
But you think Ukraine or the EU was responsible for killing 15 Russian generals and sinking the Moskva??
That was 100% US intel, and you can take that to the bank.
Long story short, the EU needs US help and that is being provided.
But at the end of the day, the EU is going to have to invest more-heavily in military tech and infrastructure, and they need to do it now.
I feel as an American a responsibility to help our European Allie’s with our massive military capabilities.
This is what all of us have been paying trillions of dollars for decades.
You can argue it isn’t our fight, but if it isn’t then why did we spend so much to just turn our backs when the word is teetering.
This is why, this is why America is THE world leader.
We protect our Allies and we persevere the US dollar for global stability.
I didn’t sacrifice my tax dollars on healthcare, schools, and other public services just so our military sector could stand by idly with their hundreds of billions a year budget!
You joke but these are real people dying and a country invaded and in terror.
How nice is it as an American to never even THINK about being invaded or killed and enslaved.
What a great thing to have absolute security and global dominance.
You’ll never experience rockets raining down on your home town as you wonder if you’ll be blown apart or berried in rubble.
World is a violent, shitty place and anytime someone can defend and stand up for someone else they should.
It’s the right thing to do and the brave thing to do.
