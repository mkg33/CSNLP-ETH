I don't know why so many people are butt hurt over this.
India wasn't the one who promised freedom to Afghan people and ran away handing them over to Taliban.
Afghanis now selling their kids and organs to just to get food.
India will not have a blind eye to this like America and Europe did.
It's their mess , India just trying to keep it as clean as it can.
If you people are having a problem with it then it's just your problem.
As Indians we are proud of what our government is doing in Afghanistan.
I suppose my fear here is just that we’re kinda in a lose-lose situation.
Giving aid to Afghanistan, while the morally right thing to do, could help keep the Taliban in power, which could help perpetuate suffering and oppression in the region.
Not helping, while horrific and honestly a terrible thing to do, has at least a chance that the Taliban may just fall apart on their own.
Of course it could also just give them a way to blame their faults in others.
I don’t like helping to perpetuate the Taliban but I also hate to let their people suffer.
It’s just lose-lose.
