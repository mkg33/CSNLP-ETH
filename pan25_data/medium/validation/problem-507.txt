I poke my head into right-wing areas every so often to keep a bead on things, and this is honestly the closest to an anti-Trump consensus I've seen among right-wing people since 2015.
Actually, Trump basically didn't exist as a political leader for them at all prior to 2015, so I think ... since his rise to power, really, I've never seen so many of them turn on him.
Everyone is saying it, they come up to me on the street and say “Sir - can you believe how great a loser this trump guy is?
I’ve never seen someone lose as good as him.
One of the world’ great losers”.
