With something like lying, it's not so clear.
Republicans will bring up Richard Blumenthal and, while it's not a 1:1 comparison, it does bring up the fact that we do forgive some lying about background.
So in considering expelling Santos, you're moving the standard for expulsion from very clear and binary, "are they convicted of a crime or not?"
to a spectrum, "how much lying is too much lying?"
On a scale from Blumenthal to Santos, how bad is it?
And the spectrum introduces subjectivity, not over whether someone lied, but whether their lies are serious enough for expulsion.
And there, in the subjectivity is where you'll find people finding rationale to avoid expelling people from their party.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
