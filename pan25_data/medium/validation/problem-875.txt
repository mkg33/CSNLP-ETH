Keep it in their family and regional.
Pakistan needs to be occupied with something so they aren’t producing their own terrorists for export.
Watch with popcorn.
Is this what you’re talking about?
Because if so, it’s mentioning that they were beat due ticks but moving 1990 ( When India started to liberalize their economy) they started to outpace Pakistan.
Pakistan's economy before 1979 was miles ahead of India.
The Soviet-Afghan and refugees brought it down, with another recovery in the 1990s, and another decline due to the NATO invasion of Afghanistan and more refugees coming in.
Pakistan's economy is already acting as a war-economy.
Every Military dictatorship in Pakistan has been extremely beneficial for its economy.
You are right that shifting to a civilian government is a problem, because civilian governments always mismanage the economy due to factionalism and sometimes nationalization in the case of Bhutto.
No, it was morseo the fact that Paksitan doesn't have a stable history with operations of government.
Hence, business stayed clear of investing in Pakistan.
Pakistan also heavily relies on foreign funding.
the link you quoted shows since 1960-2006 pakistan's Gross Domestic Product Per Capita was higher than India, regardless of coups, civilian governments, and dictatorships.
Only 2006+India's GDP recently started outpacing Pakistan.
2006 was the time the TTP was born, the War on Terror was in full swing.
“Another way to measure the different paths is in gross domestic product per person.
In 1990, India and Pakistan had almost identical per-capita GDPs, a little under $370 per person.
But by 2021, India’s had surged to $2,277, about 50% higher than Pakistan’s.”.
“The growth script flipped in the 1990s, with India growing at a 6% rate over the next 30 years, outpacing Pakistan’s 4%.”.
IMO the reason India's economy never grew until now was because from 1947-1989s India was ruled by a single Gandhi/Nehru family, whose economic policy was a shitfest of socialism, nationalization and nepotism.
“In addition, in 1991, India liberalized trade, lowered tariffs, made it easier for domestic companies to operate and grow, and opened the door to more foreign investment.”.
It wasn’t more so because of a single family holding them, but more so the nation believed in nationalizing everything and staying out of the chaos that was a direct result of the Cold War.
For all the factors involved, it was the correct decision for the time.
But when the Cold War came to a close end, India started opening up and more willing to economically get involved globally.
