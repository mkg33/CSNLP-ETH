China uses forced labor in almost every large aspect of manufacturing and food production/ distribution.
Just watch the Netflix docuseries Rotten they have multiple episodes that involve forced labor .
It is not surprising they do it with electronics and other goods.
In my mind, car companies have been slowly moving to the NestlÃ© and Perdue Pharma class of evil companies over the past few years.
Anand Giridharadas outlines an argument that the most troublesome companies are those who manufacture the problem they hope to solve.
These companies clearly engage in manufacture problems and selling the solution for profit, in North America for example it's dependence on cars (car dependence sells cars and makes society car dependent, and the growing size of cars making it necessary to upsize your car for safety).
I'm not surprised that car companies are implicated in Uighur forced labour.
>By documenting the connection of automobile components to Xinjiang, the report raises questions about whether car manufacturers are in compliance with a U.S. law, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA).
No way People with more money than they could possibly spend in ten lifetimes are using slave labor to have even more money No Fucking Way this happened!
