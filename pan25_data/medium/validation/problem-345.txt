That's cool... well we know it sometimes does materials science experiments exposing stuff to space and it sometimes deploys stuff... and it maneuvers.
And it's up for a really long time.
We'd see them launch it and the orbit would make it pretty obvious what it was anyway.
Plus the X-37b might snap some pics of it.
Maybe wave back, with it's little robot arm.
A buddy of mine worked on the X-37b, I have always been really curious about all the things it does up there.
He swears he just built the thing and has no idea, but I ask him a couple times a year just in case he has some kind of idea and can't say and it ever becomes declassified.
The design however was declassified when NASA took over the development after the airforce copped out of paying for it so we know the design.
But then suddenly they wanted it back and reclassified everything.
What it's main mission is, that's anyone's guess.
I think it's kind of a swiss army knife like the Shuttle.
It can do all sorts of missions.
I just did a Google search for President Harambe and don't see him.
Only a Gorilla.
Wasn't human president Harambe assassinated?
What timeline am I in?
