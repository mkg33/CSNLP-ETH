That’s some funny speculation when a bunch have made statements, videos and burned down recruiting installations.
Don’t you just love how we cannot be sure if these fires happen because of corrupt Russian bureaucrats, Russian rebels or foreign spec ops.
There is an anarcho communist movement who have claimed responsibility for a lot of the sabotage as of recent.
If we want to go encourage them all we gotta do is congratulate them and provide extra cash for supplies.
I know the anarcho scene in Europe and.
Eastern Europe , they’ve been waiting for something like this so they can “pop off”.
So ,, this is right up their alley in operational tactics and ideology.
Right.
Either something isn't there that's supposed to be, something is there that someone doesn't want to be or something is about to leave there that someone doesn't want it too.
Anarcho-communist movements claiming responsibility for sabotage in Russia is kind of like Q-anons claiming responsibility for protests in America... it doesn't necessarily tell the whole story.
