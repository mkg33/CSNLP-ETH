I bet an easy workaround for all of this would be to have a preliminary psychologic assessment interview for all prospective candidates applying to be police.
When 4/5's of the candidate mental profiles come back unfit for police work, with a far-greater fit in the military, they can get funneled into basic.
Let's face it, we know the profile of these types because they're all the same: "educated" but stupid as fuck, inferiority complex, asshole, feels highly-empowered by their title.
These guys are not your friendly neighborhood police officer types; and the problem gets compounded when they stay cops, get promoted, and hire more of their own, developing this "culture" like a cancer.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
