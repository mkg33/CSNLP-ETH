The type of theoretical virus that is incredibly contagious, even before symptoms begins to show, outright kills about 5-10% of its victims, permanently disables another 25%, and actually causes the young and healthy amongst us (instead of the older folks we conveniently put away in retirement homes) to die from drowning in our own pus as our immune system basically overreacts and commits murder-suicide on itself and the body?
Full disclosure I don’t have a science background but I’d imagine a virus with a really high mortality rate would kill off its victims far too quickly to spread effectively.
COVID had something like a 1%-1.5% fatality rate and that was skewed towards the most vulnerable amongst us, and even then many medical systems came near actual collapse from workload attrition or simply running out of beds.
If you have something resembling the 1918 Spanish flu today, especially at a time when the medical systems are still short staffed/recovering, and when COVID is transitioning towards an endemic at the same time, then it really would paint a bleak picture, I’d imagine.
It's entirely dependent on how contagious it is before symptoms begin.
If it's highly contagious while a person seems healthy, it doesn't really matter if it goes on to kill 100% of its victims after they've spread the virus.
Some diseases are extremely lethal in a short period of time, like ebola....and the transmission vectors are limited.
Bird flu, could be highly contagious, spreading from person to person for days/weeks before they even begin to know they're sick.
One aspect of that though is lockdowns.
If the virus made people EXTREMELY ill and lockdowns were in place....essentially people would be too sick to go to their christmas dinner, would comply with lockdown and would probably die.
In this scenario, the virus would probably fizzle out.
The problem with covid is that many people have no symptoms or mild symptoms and feel perfectly fine going out to their high school reunion.
They don't comply with lockdowns because they're not feeling terrible, and they spread the virus.
