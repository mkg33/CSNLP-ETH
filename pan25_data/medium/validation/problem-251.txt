I’d guess it’s because it isn’t so easy to impose a no fly zone against Russia as it was, say, against Iraq.
Russia may be a paper tiger today compared to what was thought of them two years ago, but they still have a lot more war fighting capability than Iraq or Serbia.
NATO member states may just not be ready, politically, for the losses of life of their own citizens that a no fly zone over Ukraine would entail, as they may not be able to actually build and enforce a no fly zone against as advanced a force as Russia without actually being in-country and participating in action directly themselves or else giving weapons systems to Ukraine that are still classified and not allowed into the hands of other nations yet, by the various laws of the member nations.
And while Russia’s nuclear attack threats are almost certainly just bluff, it may be that no one wants to find out what happens when NATO soldiers fight the Russian military directly.
If NATO has difficulty refilling stockpiles, imagine Russia’s situation.
They have an economy smaller than Italy.
They have sanctions limiting electronic imports.
Once those Soviet stockpiles are gone, Russia will have virtually nothing.
