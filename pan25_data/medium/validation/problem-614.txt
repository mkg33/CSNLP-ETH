Politicians will never allow the kind of money to be spent that is needed.
Politicians hate having large sums of money spent while they are in office.
They think it makes them look like irresponsible liberal leaders.
They don't give a shit that, that attitude shoves the problem down the road because they will be dead when the world burns.
All economic systems suffer from tragedy of the commons.
It is not isolated to capitalism, not significantly greater in than in any other.
You want to fix it, you need unilateral action at the government and supra-government levels.
Which is hard, because it requires the average person get involved to force change and hold polluters accountable.
like half of the biggest polluters aren't even democracies.
"force change" is easy to say but very unlikely to be even possible.
and that's discounting the fact that the most vocal people's idea is change is to make it worse.
like working tirelessly against nuclear energy resulting in fossil fuels being burned or subsidizing electric cars filled with environmental disaster called batteries.
Confronting climate change means confronting capitalism.
We'll never drop capitalism, therefore we will not solve climate change.
Nuclear isn't a viable option.
It takes too long to build, is too expensive, and it's cooling systems are too sensitive to climate effects.
Renewables are here now, cheaper, quick even when you consider basic battery technology and discount alternatives.
Like long term hydrogen storage or pump hydro, among many others.
Most don't realize what they're doing, it's hard to know when people lie at your from all directions.
Like you're point bellow, it's a great example of that.
yep, here we go.
complaining about climate change, anti-nuclear, pro technology that is polluting, expensive or non existent so we have to keep burning coal and gas.
