On Sunday, at least two moderate Republicans expressed their reservations about supporting the rules package, citing what they described as secret deals and the disproportionate power potentially being handed out to a group of 20 conservatives.
Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., a strong McCarthy supporter, said she currently is “on the fence” about the proposed rules.

Please if you have any questions or concerns.
“I like the rules package,” Mace said, in reference to what has been released publicly.
“What I don’t support is a small number of people trying to get a deal done or deals done for themselves in private, in secret.”.
Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, was an outright “no” against the rules package, decrying an “insurgency caucus” that he said would cut defense spending and push extremist legislation, such as on immigration.
Actually the government has allocated the money for spending, but had not borrowed it yet.
It is an increase on the debt, but Congress has already passed the bills that require the additional debt.
It is irresponsible for the AP to refer to the debt limit like this.
This implies that refusing to raise the debt ceiling is limiting spending for the future, like taking away someone's credit card.
This is why Republicans all think this is OK to do.
The government already borrowed the money, this is agreeing to pay it back.
