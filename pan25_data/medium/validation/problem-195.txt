Don’t worry another corporate dem will fall on the sword for all the other corp dems that really don’t want their legislation to pass.
Hr1 would kneecap citizens United and they love that money as much as the gop does but unlike the gop their voters won’t approve of every move they make and need a scapegoat in a red state.
I don’t think the corp dems want all three branches, because if they did they could of really sweeper the floor with the gop.
Obviously this is just my opinion but I’ve arrived here by watching decades of elections.
The difference between the two parties (for me) is the expectations and values of their voters.
In general, be courteous to others.
