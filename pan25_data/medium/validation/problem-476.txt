Listening to Inside of You (Michael Rosenbaum's podcast) and listening to Laura Vandervoort from Smallville talk about how Allison tried to get her into NXIVM and all that happened was absolutely horrific.
It follows the experience of a lady named Sarah Edmondson who reportedly helped pull back the curtains of the operation.
I looked her up one day and watched this documentary on how she got involved with that cult and then landed in prison.
Broke my heart.
I'll link it below.
(Delete if not allowed, mod.

I had zero knowledge about it.
And upon listening to her story and then afterwards doing my own research, I was shocked on so many levels.
Like, kept asking myself "How is this real life?!"
But then, kept reminding myself about Scientology.
But nonetheless, it still all makes me shake my head in disbelief.
