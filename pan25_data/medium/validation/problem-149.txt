I have always told people from the start that Ukraine would not be a push over in this war.
I firmly believed and still do that Ukraine has a spirit of staying independent and that is why Russia attacked Ukraine first before all of the other countries because it was trying to show it could "crush a strong country".
That being said, I think people cling to Zelenskyy the strenh of Ukraine because he has shown the Ukrainian spirit.
Is he the source of the spirit?
Absolutely not.
However, when there were offers of evacuation and he says "I need bullets and weapons not a ride", it really shows that spirit.
He is more of the spirit that can be easily pointed to by supporters trying to justify more support such as visiting Kherson days after the withdrawal by Russian troops, visiting soldiers who are wounded (largely symbolic but it shows he knows of their sacrifice), and staying in Kyiv during the attempted attack on it.
He shows that Ukraine is willing to fight on especially given the fact that he can largely walk around without threats of assassination from his own people (see Putin for contrast).
Voroshylov, who goes by the call sign "Karaya," downed five of the powerful Shahed-136 drones in a nighttime battle on October 12, according to Ukrainian news reports.
With his MiG-29 damaged by debris from a drone, he maneuvered the plane away from Vinnytsia before ejecting.
Debris also struck his neck and cheek.
