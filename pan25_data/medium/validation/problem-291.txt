I totally agree with you.
Jess Piper in MO and Jill Fellows in UT both did it - a ton of door to door in rural, unfriendly territory.
Neither won their races but they have my undying gratitude and admiration for courageously trying.
I hope more people get involved with their local and state governments - even if itâ€™s not running for office but just being informed or being there to hold them accountable.
I also hope more people talk to their loved ones in rural areas to help them see the light.
I know not all can be swayed, but I still hold out hope that some can see the truth and stop voting red.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
