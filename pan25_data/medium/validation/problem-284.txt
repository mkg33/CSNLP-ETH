If you pop over to r/irs you'll see a lot of this.
Sure, there are dummies that tried to claim credits they weren't entitled to that are whining about not pulling it off - but then there are plenty like me that are under audit to prove that our kids, the same kids we've claimed since birth, are actually ours and that we paid for their upkeep.
They're not disputing my business deductions, but my children.
When I called the agent told me it's just a "random audit that happened to a lot of people claiming kids this year".
They also wanted me to send in 8 months of paystubs from 2021 to back up what was on the W2 I (and the company that paid me - a hospital) sent in.
Just piddly weird shit that has a track record years long but no, THIS time is suspicious.
Sorry, just extra salty that uber rich people seem to sail by but nah, it's me that gets investigated.
