Executive Order 13526, which forms the legal basis for the U.S. classification system, states that "information may be classified at one of the following three levels", with Top Secret as the highest level (Sec.
1.2).
However, this executive order provides for special access programs that further restricted access to a small number of individuals and permit additional security measures (Sec.
4.3).
These practices can be compared with (and may have inspired) the concepts multilevel security and role-based access control.
U.S. law also has special provisions protecting information related to cryptography (18 USC 798), nuclear weapons and atomic energy (see Controls on atomic-energy information) and the identity of covert intelligence agents (see Intelligence Identities Protection Act).
Fully agree - and I'd actually like the investigation to be concluded swiftly since the ones being investigated will likely be 100% cooperative.
It's not like DoJ will have to be dealing with full on liars and criminals which takes forever to find the answers.
