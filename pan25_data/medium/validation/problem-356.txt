Russia hasn't stopped bombing Ukraine civilian infrastructure, it's a safe bet that this particular bombing was just part of the normal schedule of bombing, only coincidentally following this particular attack.
Unless you know someone in the Russian chain of command that told you that this particular strike was in retaliation for the attacks at Engels, you can only speculate with no more evidence than anyone else.
If you do have an "in" on that CoC, then one wonders why you are posting here.
Also, nobody has confirmed that the "attacks" at Engels were actually attacks, or by Ukraine for that matter.
Looking at your history, you seem to support the idea that Ukraine shouldn't try to take back anything occupied by Russia before the 24th, so that would be Donbas, Luhansk, and Crimea.
Of course, all those territories are Ukrainian, occupied by an invading country, and supporting the concept of giving those sovereign areas of Ukraine to Russia as a reward is what Russia wants.
I categorically have never supported Russia in this war ever.
I do not want Russia to have any Ukrainian territory.
Learn to fucking read and attack the debate rather than the person.
I'll disagree with your claim above and say for Ukraine to win they'll need to push Russia completely out of Ukraine, period.
That means Donbas, Luhansk, and Crimea, all the way out to the Ukraine border with Russia.
The only negotiations will be determining reparations, arranging for extradition of war criminals, and if Russia wants it, surrender of their forces and return of those forces alive back to Russia.
I personally have no preference which way Russians return to their country, on foot, in a box, or a bag, it's all the same to me.
Right, but it's an air to surface missile - so the question presumably isn't the distance from Ukrainian borders; it's the distance from where Ukranian planes feel they can fly without a high risk of getting shot down?
Aren't NATO weapons delivered with the understanding that they can't be used to attack sovereign Russia territory?
I highly doubt Ukraine would be so willing to bite the hand that feeds them.
Ukraine developed weapons are another story though and they have that 1000km range suicide drone in testing.
