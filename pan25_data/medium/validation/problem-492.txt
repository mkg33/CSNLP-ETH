My favorite part was when zoomers on reddit were so surprised when the nu-Taliban turned out to be just as evil as everyone said they would be.
Millennials and older were like "yup, they do be like that.
".
The message isn't about the individuals and the audience isn't just in the stands.
We're probably the primary audience and the message is: "the Taliban will do whatever it wants.
".
Part of it may be the strong Islamic belief and practice of not creating images of man.
(Maybe animal as well.
).
And one may say its core mechanics never left us, and just takes a new form, by which I mean that's why cyberbullying exists.
Allowing people outside Afghanistan to figure out that the individuals were, for example, innocent would distract from their message.
It's also communicating to people in the country who might be considering revolt that the Taliban can execute anyone without needing to even say why.
The resumption of the practice underscored the Talibanâ€™s intention of sticking to their strict interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia.
I think the West frequently makes the mistake of thinking the Taliban are ignorant or unaware of the messages they're sending just because they are brutal.
On the other hand, it could just be because they're blindly brutal and don't want anyone talking to westerners ever.
Public punishment exist to please the public, specifically to appeal to the sense of justice.
This is why popped up in a lot of cultures in slightly different forms.
e.g.
witch-hunt.
