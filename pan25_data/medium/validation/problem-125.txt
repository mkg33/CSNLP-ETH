The major shift in society is that we have completely lost our sense of community cohesion which has made a huge amount of people mentally ill. Depression and anxiety are debilitating and excruciating so people self medicate with drugs.
In my experience, most people in the greatest generation and the baby boomer generation would use drugs or alcohol recreationally and the outliers were the ones who abused them, typically low-income people who lived in toxic communities.
Soft drugs like cannabis have disappeared in alot of places and been replaced with fentanyl and meth.
Even beer has increased in potency by about 4% and liquor sales are higher than ever.
Legal cannabis is so basically all hash now and people have found new ways to concentrate it further, it seems people can't get high enough these days.
Sweden has 0% first day (actually 20% of week to make it more fair for hourly with different lenh of shifts), then 80% by employer untill 14th day.
Then its goverment at 80% for i don't know how long but atleast 3 months as personally needed it that.
