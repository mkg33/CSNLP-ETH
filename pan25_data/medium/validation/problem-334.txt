For me personally, the GOP crossed that threshold in 1980, when Reagan/Quayle aligned with Bryant/Falwell after the latter quashed gay civil rights in Dade County to score evangelical votes.
No smiles from "the Great Communicator" could undo that treachery.
They confirmed their bigotry over the next 8 years by snidely doing nothing while my friends and lovers died by the thousands from AIDS.
McCarthy, Cohn, Atwater, Nixon, Haldeman, Agnew, Schlafly, Bryant, Falwell, Reagan, Quayle, Gingrich, Cheney, Tea Partiers, McConnell, 38 Senators who just voted against marriage equality....
GOP hate-mongering began much earlier, 1950 at latest, when Joseph Mccarthy, Roy Cohn and (a very young) Nixon began communist witch-hunting and lavendar-scare terrorizing of homosexuals.
As a gay boy born in 1954, I grew up watching GOP lies and hate destroy the lives of people like me.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Yup.
That's why Atwater & Nixon were on my list.
The southern strategy was "secret" in 1968, but apparent to anyone paying attention.
I was just 14yo then and I saw it.
Any adult should have... if they cared to.
The GOP has ran on racism and misogyny for as long as I can remember.
Actually, even longer than that, see this archive of a 2012 The Nation article regarding Lee Atwater’s Infamous 1981 Interview on the Southern Strategy -- confirms Atwater’s incendiary remarks and places them in context.
At no time in my life have GOP leaders not been enabling bigotry, fear, falsehoods and hate - in one form or another.
I've voted in every election since 1972 and have yet to vote for one of them.
I don't expect to.
In my lifetime (b.
1954) it has never occurred to GOP leaders that segregationism, homophobia and other bigotries do not deserve a plank in their party's platform.
If those people want to vote that way, the GOP could let them form a 3rd party (as George Wallace did).
They'd get trounced (as George Wallace did) until their bigotry faded into history.
If I were black, the GOP would have crossed that threshold in 1968, when Atwater and Nixon courted segregationist voters who'd abandoned the Dems after LBJ pushed through the Civil Rights Act.
Nixon & Haldeman followed through with the war on drugs, which was expressly designed to weaken black communities.
Inviting them into the party without demanding they change poisoned the GOP well.
This started them down a path of increasing extremism, from which now there is no returning.
The GOP is marching off a cliff.
We can only hope the country doesn't march along.
