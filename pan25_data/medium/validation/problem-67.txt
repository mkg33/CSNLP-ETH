A college course I took for my political science minor included a textbook of academic writings on presidencies.
I haven’t been able to locate the textbook in question but distinctly recall that the section on President Carter (1977-1981) labeled him “the most conservative Democratic president since Grover Cleveland” (1885-1889) & (1893-1897).
Outside of the presidency Jimmy Carter has lived a principled life of service.
Certainly a religious man, but in stark contrast to the politicians and wonks using religion and faith as a cover for exclusionary and hate centered policies.
If he had never been president, his record as a humanitarian stands alone as an example of sorely missed compassion.
Carter got dealt a bad hand in terms of the events that were out of his control.
His administration itself did little to no harm in terms of long term historical ramifications.
This can't be said for Reagan and Bush Sr. with the failed Drug War, arming Saddam, Reagan tax cuts and introducing Faith based politics.
He should have been elected.
The damage done by the Reagan administration haunts this country every single day.
And post administration he has done more for this country through humanitarian efforts than any other former President.
He was swinging hammers to build homes well into his 90s.
We were lucky to have him in office the few years we did.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Carter was challenged from the left by U.S.
Senator Ted Kennedy in the 1980 Democratic primaries, and while Carter was renominated on the first ballot, the Kennedy challenge clearly hurt Carter among liberals.
By this evaluation, Democratic presidents judged more liberal than Carter were Woodrow Wilson (1913-1921); FDR (1933-1945); Harry Truman (1945-1953); JFK (1961-1963); and LBJ (1963-1969).
In the 1980 general election, exit polls showed that just 60% percent of self-identified liberals voted for Carter, while a remarkable 28% of liberals voted for Reagan and the rest for independent John Anderson (a liberal Republican congressman).
