Cambridge Dictionary was asked what prompted the updated definitions, and when exactly they were changed.
A spokesman for the Cambridge Dictionary said: “Our editors made this addition to the entry for ‘woman’ in October.
“They carefully studied usage patterns of the word ‘woman’ and concluded that this definition is one that learners of English should be aware of to support their understanding of how the language is used.
”The first definition at the entry for woman remains unchanged and continues to be ‘an adult female human being.’.
“Our dictionaries are written for learners of English and are designed to help users understand English as it is currently used.
”They are compiled by analysing a large corpus of English texts (over two billion words in total) taken from all areas of writing and publishing.
a book that contains a list of words in alphabetical order and explains their meanings, or gives a word for them in another language; an electronic product giving similar information on a computer, smartphone, etc.
Dictionaries give the definition of words as they are used, they aren’t prescribing how words should be used but rather describing how they are used.
