As an educated person myself I'd argue that the civil war was about the economic disadvantage that Southern slavery put the north at.
It make seem a mere nuance but it is more truthful than saying it was just about slavery.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Fl can make any test they want.
If a university doesn't take it, then its useless.
Desantis is going to run for prez and leave FL holding a big old bag of worthless right wing nonsense.
I don't know why any of the other state's seceded, but like 95% of Texas's reasons were straight up about slavery or viewed in a "Slave-holding states" and "non-Slave-holding states" viewpoint.
The bottom line is it WAS about free labor and economics, not human rights.
Well not about the human rights of the slaves.
Traditions observed are something the individual chooses for themselves and it is not the right or place of the government to select them for you.
I think they see that more and more people could not fucking care less about tradition and care far more about FACTS and a culture that matters to them rather than following something dead people followed.
The bottom line is this, the rest of the nation's colleges are not going to accept some home grown test that tows the party line for DeSantis and his band of merry Fascists.
They are looking for specific bodies of knowledge that serve a purpose to employers.
Your sincerely held beliefs and traditions are not worth a mouth full of cold spit in the work place.
math, science, biology, computer skills...those are worth something.
That you read the bible 20 times while growing up and believe that you eat the body and drank the blood of a fictional dude literally means nothing to most people these days.
