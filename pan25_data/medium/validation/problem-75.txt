I know running a deficit and having a substantial amount of debt is par for the course among most developed economies, but that's still crazy.
Keep in mind, that Japan also has a declining population and said population is likely to be reduced substantially over time, which will put further pressure on their economic output.
So there is some desire to fix the issue, but if they've consistently missed their budget-balancing targets, achieving a surplus by 2026 might be wishful thinking.
They seriously want people to have more kids... they're just not willing to do anything to make it happen beyond promoting drinking in the hopes of making more 'oops' babies.
It's basically the same problem conservatives have had forever - they want things to happen, but they're not willing to make any positive changes to facilitate those things happening.
Honestly, I’m not sure how you even solve this massive of a debt problem.
You have a declining population and a stagnant economy.
You can’t spend your way out of it, and your output is declining so your debt stays high while you slowly earn less.

You can address that kind of problem with both workplace regulations and cultural shifts, and those kind of solutions don't cost much to implement.
But instead of trying to alleviate the root causes of Japan's toxic corporate culture, most of the country's power brokers have instead simply doubled-down on most of the practices that drive overwork.

Finland has arguably the best benefits on the planet for young families, and their fertility rate is still lower than Japan’s.
People just don't want them.
45% of people live alone, the amount has doubled in 30 years.
Living alone and spending your free time consuming digital media is far more appealing than raising a family.
The biggest correlation to declining birthrates is not work hours, but female education.
Women with education, jobs and prospects have better things to do than be mothers for 5 children.
50% of Japanese government debt is owned by the Japanese Central Bank.
The rest of it is primarily owned by domestic citizens, which is practically like being in debt to yourself.
On top of that, Japan has been the world's largest creditor nation for the last 30 years.
Japan will be fine.
