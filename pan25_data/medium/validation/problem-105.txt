Question is this - do we play a more dangerous version of the game we just played in the midterms and actually allow and support Trump to become the GOP nominee again, just because we are confident that he is beatable?
Whether or not he chooses to run again, I will crawl over broken glass to make sure Trump and his goons donâ€™t get anywhere near the White House ever again.

As evil and awful as Trump, but smart enough to be effective.
Too many people seem to think the crap we are seeing is because of Trump, but he's merely the latest iteration of what the GOP is producing.
