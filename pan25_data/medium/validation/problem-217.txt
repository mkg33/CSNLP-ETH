He wrote another two books called Shark Life and Shark Trouble which expound on his decades of work and studying of sharks.
I read Shark Life in middle school and it really taught me a lot about sharks.
Probably more than shark week did.
I think his writing of that book was inspired by his desire to save shark populations after their decimation.
Edit: another commenter pointed out that I had mixed up the two titles, I’ve now added the second one for clarity.
Holy smokes, you’re right!
I got the name wrong in my comment.
That’s the book I read and was thinking of.
But there’s another book by him called Shark Trouble, I must have gotten them mixed up.
It was a really good book.
It sticks in my memory too.
Thinking about it brings me back to where I was when I read it.
Peter Benchley was a talented writer!
I feel it's a bit misunderstood.
Instead of borrowing from the action serials of the 40s it was aping the sci-fi B-movies of the 50s, and the plot and tone don't 100% jive with the other three movies.
It's far from perfect, but its not nearly as bad as its reputation.
Me neither, I put it about on par with Temple of Doom.
I don't see why aliens is any more or less believable than the holy grail or a guy ripping someone's heart out with magic.
Indiana Jones is a stupid universe.
That's not a criticism.
It's a goofy adventure movie series where people do superhuman feats to fit the plot and rule-of-cool all the time.
It's a goofy setting.
I read a good explanation one time that discussed how each movie reflected the pulp of the time period.
Where as 3 was the occult and fighting Nazis, 4 is set in the 50s.
Which was an alien/sci fi craze, with cookie cutter commies and very campy.
Both.
Industrial fishing practices are probably the majority, but people have also gone on large-scale shark hunting parties out of concerns for public safety.
Fun fact; I don’t remember if it was the making of the movie or the marketing for the book, but at some point in production, someone (I think it was a candidate for the role of director) was rejected when they got super hyped up talking about the project only to refer to the beast as a whale instead of a shark.
