Company I used to work for had ranges that would be different depending on where the candidate lived (for remote roles).
I'd often argue for exemptions to this because if the candidate is the right fit for the job and we would pay someone else this money then why would we reject the right candidate?
Most of the time, we'd be able to get the exemption.
I applied at a FAANG recently as I was an ideal candidate.
It covered CO so they had to give the range.
$85k-$159k.
On the low side, but I’m in.
Do the interviews and get offered the job.
HR tells me the real range is $90k-$120k.
I said where is the other $39k?
It was impossible to get.
Basically never existed.
It was a lie.
A perfect candidate could only ever get $120k HR said.
I walked.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
So many people seem to operate on “if I didn’t get this, no one else should either”.
You can see the same thing with all the whiners about student loan forgiveness.
I’ve seen this for decades and it’s infuriatingly selfish and short sighted.
They thought that candidates were taking advantage of them by taking the same salary in Ohio that someone would make in SF and I was just like, no you just can't take advantage of them anymore...
It's true these people were basically living like kings and queens for the same salary people were living in a tiny apartment in SF but like, with the remote world those people could leave.
