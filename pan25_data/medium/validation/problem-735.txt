What I have seen, so far, is of the people I have interreacted with (almost 50), none of them or immediate family has died.
I literally follow up with each person after they get back into the office 1:1 to see if they and their families are ok!
It's usually just a quick chat on IM.
I ask every time there is a flare up because I have been concerned for them.
I am very grateful for that no one or their family I have met has died, as it seems from our media that China is highly affected.
I think a lot of people seem to have either forgotten or are somehow believing China's official death numbers for the initial outbreak too.
I tried googling for 2020 china covid deaths and saw 'unofficial' death estimates anywhere from 36,000 to 1.7 million (?!).
In either case, it seems like their liar 5k official death number for the initial outbreak seems to have stuck, so it's probably why they're lying again.
That's an "estimate" made by bogus individuals.
We know the exact variant that is spreading in China, and its high R factor is combined with an extremely low virulence.
