House Republican leaders decided to put Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) on the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, the chamber’s main investigative panel.
That’s a handsome reward for the woman who fabricated the belief that Jews have been using lasers in space to start forest fires.
GOP leaders named Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) to the same panel.
That’s a plum assignment for a guy who has floated notions about Jeffrey Epstein being murdered and the menace of fluoride in the water supply (in between dalliances with QAnon and white nationalists).
Also earning a slot on the committee: Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), a QAnon admirer who helped hatch the claim that Democrats would be arrested en masse after the 2020 election.
In this, at least, I’ve got plenty of company.
