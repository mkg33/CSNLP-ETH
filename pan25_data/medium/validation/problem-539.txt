I just don't get it like why does it keep happening?
Like are they getting timber they can't get somewhere else or they really need all of that land for housing like what is the point I just it seems like it's I guess just hard for me to believe that that's all just like what lumber that they're selling or are they digging for oil or what is the point I don't.
It's for agriculture, like converting the forest to soyfields and cow grazing areas.
And most, if not all, of it is for export.
So it isn't solely about brazilians.
Megacorps from 1st world countries are undoubtedly involved (who else would Brazil export to?
).
The worst part is the Amazon is a global greenhouse gas reducer.
This doesn’t just hurt Brazil - it hurts everyone on the planet.
That’s the gravity of the deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest.
The Amazon Rainforest isn't an environmental issue for Brazil (at least for the government), it's an economic one.
And unfortunately, the Brazilian government, along with the rest of the world (admit it or not) have generally decided that it's more valuable as capital for businesses than for environmental sustainability.
Can't say if this is sarcasm because there are so many dumb fuckers on the internet, but you don't honestly expect a guy who didn't even take office yet to suddenly start taking iniciatives to fight deforestation, right?
Moreover, there was in fact a reduction in deforestation during Lula's previous terms, so expecting that he will be as bad as Bolsonaro is just insanity.
If the Amazon is REALKY that important, and the world at large REALLY cared, then more proactive measures need to be taken.
Like maybe, for lack of a better term, bribe Brazil into keeping the forest.
Not just pure monetary, but infrastructure, industries, trade, resources (maybe even actual inder the table bribes); make it more than what they can possibly earn by deforesting the Amazon.
