Right?
Why are we pretending like anyone is doing anything TO Russia?
Everything that has transpired and will transpire in the future, Russia did to itself.
The fear is more that the collapse of Russia might bring instability to the region.
A partition of the territory (if not political but de facto) would see local armed conflicts.
The emergence of private military groups in Russia is a step in this direction.
Warlords fighting each other for control over those regions represent a high risk for the nukes they have.
The risk is not really of them using it (i don't think those warlords would be able to have control of both the nukes and the means to send them), but more the risk of them selling it to anyone.
For those who aren’t keeping track, in addition to Wagner, the largest PMC with tens of thousands of mercs, there’s at least two other smaller mercenary groups confirmed to operate there, consisting of a mix of Russians, Syrians and Ossetians, allegedly on the payroll of a Russian minister and one of the oligarch-run megacorps.
Furthermore the Russian Orthodox Church is believed to be funding a two thousand man volunteer force, the ROVS (basically the descendants of Civil War veterans who didn’t return to Russia after 1991) operate a foreign volunteer force associated with Igor Girkin, and Dimitry Rogozin is believed to operate an imperialist volunteer corps hoping to use the conquest of Ukraine as a springboard for the restoration of the Russian Empire.
There’s also three forces that are technically part of the Russian Army but are practically independent warlord forces.
The Donetsk and Luhansk People’s militias are the two first, consisting primarily of the force conscripted local men and women of East Ukraine, bolstered by some remaining Russian mercs and cossacks from the various Russian cossack hosts, primarily the Don Host, who are greatly enjoying this chance to partake in raiding the lands, properties and women of their centuries old rivals in the Zaporizhye Cossack Host.
Finally there’s the Chechens, who are essentially the private army of Ramzan Kadyrov, the warlord of Chechnya-Ichkeria.
These guys are generally too valuable to risk in battle since they are keeping the Caucasus from exploding in Russia’s face again, and so they get the best equipment and plum positions well behind the front lines, where they do propaganda, shoot deserters and beat up units retreating without permission.
On the rare occasions some are captured (usually during Ukrainian counteroffensives), the Russians will usually immediately trade Ukrainian prisoners for them, sometimes at a rate of three Ukrainians for each Chechen.
Now, all of these groups operate with varying degrees of independence from Russian central command, though they can’t deviate too much from what the Army wants since they still share the Army supply lines.
Just look at how when Wagner stopped attacking Bakhmut and instead threw themselves into moderately to very successful offensives north of the city, like capturing Soledar.
They were promptly punished for acting out of line by having ammunition supplies mysteriously be redirected and being disallowed from recruiting prisoners anymore.
Competition is still fierce though, and many believe it was one of the rival mercenary groups that leaked the location of Dimitry Rogozin’s birthday party to the Ukrainians, which as you may remember resulted in him getting a rear end full of shrapnel.
It will be interesting to see if the Russian state monopoly on violence degrades further in coming years, nobody seems to care PMCs are illegal in Russia.
Haha, I actually applied for a job as that with a certain agency years ago, about a year out of college, but they wouldn’t take me because my mother was a foreign citizen.
I’m actually just a high school teacher and historian now.
I just happen to know a bit of Russian and have followed this conflict decently closely since 2013, as well as some related events like Savchenko Incident.
