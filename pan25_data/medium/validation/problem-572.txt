UPDATE: We’re going to wrap this up.
Thanks a bunch for your questions, everyone, it's awesome to have a back-and-forth with our readers.
I hope we shed some light here and that you'll stick around for more from HuffPost where we’ll be covering all of these races on election night.
We’re HuffPost reporters and — we write about politics and far-right extremism.
The midterm elections are next week, and election deniers won GOP nominations for both secretary of state and attorney general in , and .
In Minnesota, an election denier whether people with disabilities and non-English speakers should be allowed to vote is in the race to become the state’s top elections official.
Besides outvoting them, what is it going to take to minimize if not fully prevent election deniers and insurrectionists from gaining political influence?
Chris recently for Doug Mastriano, the far-right election-denying GOP gubernatorial candidate in Pennsylvania.
If elected, Mastriano a fellow election denier as secretary of state.
There are some ongoing efforts in Congress to help safeguard the 2024 contest from the sort of challenge Trump and his allies launched in 2020: The House in September passed a bill to , which outlines the congressional certification process that served as the venue to contest the election (and ultimately the Capitol insurrection) on Jan. 6, 2021.
The Senate still needs to pass it, but it’s that top Republicans like Mitch McConnell may support, so it could potentially get across the line in the lame-duck session before a new Congress arrives next year.
At least in the short term, out-voting them is going to have to be how it’s done.
The decentralized nature of the American election system, once considered a bulwark against takeover attempts, has proven of the sort GOP election deniers are waging now: A victory for even one such candidate in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, Minnesota or Nevada could be enough to cause chaos in future presidential elections.
That said, while Electoral Count Act reform would protect against a 2020-type challenge, there are myriad other ways for an election-denying secretary of state, attorney general, or governor to gum up the electoral process, restrict voting rights, or sow confusion around elections.
And presidential elections aren’t the only concern: They could cause problems for other races too, and almost certainly will where they’re virtually certain to win.
Absent major (and unlikely) political reform, they’re going to continue to pose a risk as long as they remain so influential within the GOP.
