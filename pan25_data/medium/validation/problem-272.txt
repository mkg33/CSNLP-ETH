If they are such a closed society, why did they even want to host a world cup?
What good is it to them to have foreigners of all sorts of backgrounds visit and stick their nose around when they don't want them to or can support their stay?
They should have just hosted a twitch stream of some esport, this is pure idiocy.
Yeah, I really don't get what they're doing.
I've also been seeing billboards for Qatar tourism here in the US more and more.
But Qatar doesn't need more money, it's like they just decided they wanted to host as some form of vanity project where it never occurred to them that they'd have to keep the fans and the population largely separate for the duration of the event.
With the Saudis doing it, it's because they are realizing they need more avenues of wealth coming in because oil isn't going to keep cutting it.
Maybe it's the same for Qatar?
What is Qatar's biggest source of income, anyway?
Edit: Looked it up.
It's petroleum as well.
They're doing what the Saudis are doing.
While the Saudis still maintain their backwards ass mentality still as well, they've become relatively more lenient and accepting.
It seems Qatar, however, is opting of shooting themselves in the foot instead by doing things like releasing a list of requirements for foreigners coming to visit.
Morons.
