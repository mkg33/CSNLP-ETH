This is Russia's corruption.
The web of lies goes all the way down.
Putin who has been lied to the most since he's at the top probably thought his army was much larger and in a much better state than we all now see.
He's probably sitting there in his bunker thinking "How the fuck is this going so badly we have the second largest army in the world" You did Putin, all your buddies sold it off to get rich.
My understanding is not even "standard" missiles, as those are armed with a conventional warhead.
They seem to be firing these missiles without any kind of warhead, so damage is limited to whatever can be caused by kinetic energy and unspent fuel.
When you start scrapping nukes to use them as kinetic missiles.. Nukes..
The only reason why NATO hasn't annihilated your army in March..
Things must be REALLY bad.
I honestly wouldn't be surprised if they don't have any functional nukes.
After all, nukes are a deterrent, once they are used it's MAD anyway.
So dummy nukes do basically the same job as real ones ,comrade!
