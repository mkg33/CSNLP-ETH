I hired a certified asbestos removal specialist.
He showed up, full gear, respirator, air cleaning machine.
I walk down to check if he needs anything, my guy is mid removal, no mask on, tyvek suit half unzipped.
He “got hot”.
Said most of the guys that remove asbestos aren’t worried about it at all.
Lead is the shit that scares them.
Dude was probably 65 and has been doing asbestos removal for 30 years.
Says he gets a lung scan every year and they are perfectly clear.
Not saying we should all go inhale the stuff.
But I think the response to it has been a tad overblown.
No.
Water is the primary method of containing asbestos during construction / demolition.
In fact asbestos is generally quite inert, making it a great building material.
The health concern is that it is fibrous, resilient, and small particles are light enough to remain airborne for some time.
When it gets inside of you (breathing or eating it) it doesn't ever really leave.
This causes asbestos related cancers and other conditions.
