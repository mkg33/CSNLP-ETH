liberals forget how every single US intervention has went in the past 100 years.
fucking terrible causing blowback, civilian casualties, terrorism, loss of American freedom, as well as loss of American lives.
literally every single time American war intervention ends poorly in the entirety of American history.
first of all I'd like to mention both Bill Clinton and Obama are responsible for countless, COUNTLESS civilian deaths through war intervention and both should probably be in prison for war crimes (hint: Every single president in the past 50 years should be in prison for war crimes).
if you think Japanese internment camps and nuclear strikes on heavily populated cities are good then yea sure (Russia won ww2 on the European front so I'll give more credit to them for the positive impacts of the Germans losing).
As much as I support Ukraine, can people stop thinking about dragging NATO into this conflict.
It would be fucking devastating, just keep sending more weapons.
Especially advanced, precision-guided and long-range ones.
