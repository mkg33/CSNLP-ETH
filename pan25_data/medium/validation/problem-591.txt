Though to find a common ground with the Erdogan administration.
Another autocratic fuck.
There need to be trigger clauses that go into effect when autocrats start consolidating power in their countries.
Otherwise we’re going to end up with a henhouse full of foxes.
I agree.
But I'd rather America not be kicked out of NATO lol.
We almost lost control of the election process on J6.
No, we don’t need to find common ground with a budding autocrat.
We need to help Turkey move back toward being a democracy, and then engage with them.
Turkey will survive Erdogan, we have to make deals, follow through and forge a better partnership.
The Black Sea belongs to NATO essentially, Turkey can close it on a whim.
It's a worthwhile partnership.
Russia isn’t attacking anyone else right now, there is zero risk of that.
They also don’t have the resources to entice anyone towards them either.
This isn’t the Cold War, we don’t have to play nice with monsters because otherwise they’ll run to Russia.
The main lever on Hungary should be the EU.
Withhold funds, threaten to end freedom of movement, etc.
Tie relief to real election monitors, media reforms, etc.
