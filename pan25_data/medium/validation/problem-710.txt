“All of those things that are one- or two-day things — railroad employees don’t have that,” Edelman said.
As noted, it's not meant for being sick 1 or 2 (or 3) days, it's for "long-term" sick pay which is for 4 days or more.
The 7 days mentioned above (and the sick leave some of the unions wanted in the contract negotiations last year) were for short-term automatic paid sick time leave.
Edelman is being a bit vague, but basically saying if you get the flu and need to take 2 or 3 days off you aren't covered, but if you get the flu and need to take 4 or more days off then you are covered, it's that short-term (1-3 days) paid sick leave where there is a gap in their coverage.
