There in lay part of the issue as well.
The only exposure these folk get, is through the bullshit they are fed on their TV/Phone, and the perpetual hate and false narratives spread amongst the groups they are a part of.
I know this, as I live amongst them and hear the way they talk.
Real people with families and careers, who go into this mode when talking about "liberals being the disease of this country" or the same comments about gay people, and different races.
(The most commonly hated in Arkansas around me, are black, latino(which are all just mexicans to these people,) and chinese.
).
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
