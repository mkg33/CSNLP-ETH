I don't own an EV yet, my next will probably be one though so this was of interest to me.
The answer I've come across online, for teslas at least, the capacity loses a few percent a year then seems to plateau at about 80% of the original capacity, at least according to the anecdotal stories from people with 8+ year old teslas.
That works out to dropping to a range of 460km for one charge, which is still decent.
Of course there aren't any around at 20 years old to see though.
Hard to hit 20% EV rate in Canada if there are no EVs to buy in Canada.
My parents tried to buy a PHEV Toyota Rav4 and were told there was a six year waiting list.
Yes, six YEARS.
They settled for a PHEV Hyundai Tuscon, and they were told it would be maybe a year and a half.
So its a transfer period to 2035 until all vehicles need to be EVs.To be honest, sounds delusional considering the climate and how huge canada is.
I feel like Infrastructure and battery technology for colder climates is just not there yet to make these sort of laws.
