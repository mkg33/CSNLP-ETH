It is not the government of Canada causing the problems it is the provincial regulators who are in charge of accreditation.
The provincial governing bodies are run by doctors who don't want more competition for the dollars available.
Take the accreditation process out of the hands of doctors and put it with a provincial government agency and the accreditation problem will go away.
The way it is now it's like putting the fox in charge of the henhouse.
Same problem with trades in Canada.
You can’t become a plumber without being sponsored by a plumber and apprenticing under them.
But plumbers can only take 1 apprentice at a time and usually it’s a kid they know.
Like family or friend of family.
Shortage of healthcare workers in general.
We lost a lot during Covid either to death/injury, travel work, or retirement, and we were short to begin with.
We’re very lucky that people want to come here.
Whatever, the reality is the system sucks and needs to be overhauled.
We need doctors and the current system is not meeting those needs.
Medical schools outside of Canada are not inferior to the ones we have here.
Many countries have a superior training system and doctors from those countries should be free to practice here with the proper background checks, especially if they are Canadian citizens.
The number of foreign medical residents has been steeply dropping for at least a decade.
A White paper published years ago by ACGME aims for “American residencies for American students”.
No the provincial colleges of Physicians do.
Some provinces don't have colleges of physicians like Ontario does, so they have other names.
It is a provincial jurisdiction.
Even moving from one province to another poses problems for physicians in Canada.
And really, if your big complaint is that you have to match our salary range, yet our system is shit and our country sucks, maybe the issue isn’t us but whatever standard of living people are leaving.
The responsibility to retain talent sits with the place trying to retain the talent.
You’re really hopping around on this topic, huh?
That’s quite a dance to avoid the actual conversation you started, but sure.
It’s not the college standards they’re referring to.
It’s the continuing education and training they have to do.
I have family members who are doctors, and they have to do 50-100 hours of training annually plus annual or semi-annual testing to get and maintain credentials.
You can call them entirely unavoidable, but that’s not going to make them magically vanish, and it doesn’t mean that they shouldn’t be taken into account when looking at a salary, especially a salary before business costs and taxes.
I guess there’s no evidence if you ignore the fact that it’s a highly skilled profession that requires a decade or so of incredibly expensive schooling plus residency for shit pay, not to mention the annual cost of insurance and credentials, plus the incredidly grueling hours and the general danger of working around infectious diseases and constant exposure to traumatic shit.
This is actually why we’re starting to focus on healthcare apprenticeships (aka you get paid and they pay for your schooling) and student debt forgiveness for working in socially vulnerable areas in the US.
Healthcare groups and colleges are both realizing that they’re low on workers or losing them to other industries.
Rural hospitals are now offering housing, continuing education, and more competitive compensation thanks to federal assistance.
