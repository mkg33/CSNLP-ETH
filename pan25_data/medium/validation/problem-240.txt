When the CDC added that data in the first place I was a bit surprised (it was added under Trump's Presidency), because the CDC report refered to is not and was never intended to be a study.
It was from the "Priorities for Research to Reduce the Threat of Firearm-Related Violence" report requested by the CDC, to make an agenda for research.
It's literally about topics they should focus on, when they start studying gun violence.
It's put together by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), in collaboration with the National Research Council (NRC) National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.
They literally identify the quality of data as an issue in itself, they don't say that either of those figures are true, and it's also no figures that the CDC came up with.
This was made righter after 2013 after Obama's executive action to look into gun violence.
Note that the CDC never really did anything with this because they didn't get any funding to actually do anything.
Tl;dr the source for the data is not a CDC study, it's an agenda made by 3rd party setting the research priorities that the CDC should focus on on the topic of gun violence.
If we look at the section where the self-defense figures are mentioned, at the end where Research Questions for that section is written, it says this:
The CDC study was a literature review which is essentially an overview of all research done in a particular area.
The review hypothesizes the real number is much lower than 2.5M (my memory is foggy but i think around 200k) while advocating this area be a key focus of future research due to the disparity.
