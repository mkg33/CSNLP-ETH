Most people also believe that driving under the influence of any intoxication, be it drug or alcohol, should be illegal.
What I don’t get is, voting against something you don’t like, so others also can’t have it.
It’s so immature.
I doubt it’s because they had a bad trip.
It’s probably that they’re old, and the old hate everything; or they just hate Portland and think shrooms are drugs.
I’ve heard that shrooms have shown good efficacy in therapeutic situations.
Having used them several times though, I’m aware they may have powerfully disorienting psychotropic and hallucinogenic properties.
I’ve never experienced a full-blown hallucination on shrooms, but I saw trails everywhere and felt giddily unreal.
I don’t feel comfortable with the notion of others driving under their uncontrolled influence, any moreso than I do for people doing so under alcohol.
Most people don't actually believe that and I've never seen that narrative.
That weed is generally harmless?
Yes.
That it can't be a problem?
No.
Or even weed, if they’re stoned stupid.
I have to drive my sister everywhere because she’s always stoned out of her senses.
But heaven forbid I tell her she’s got a substance use disorder because that’s contrary to the popular narrative that weed is utterly harmless and nobody can be a pothead.
Anything can be an addiction, and most people agree on that.
Not every addiction is a problem.
The problem is if it negatively affects your life and those around you.
Oh man.
It’s a real challenge, and I’m not against legal weed.
But I assure you, it’s not some “conservative nonsense” that there are potheads who live on government assistance and do nothing but smoke pot and play videogames, while making excuses for themselves and defending their drug of choice with every source they require to fulfill their cognitive biases.
And these are as easy for a pothead to find as is racist “data” easy to find by a bigot.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Meanwhile, both you and every other taxpayer are supporting my sister so she may be , and I help pay her rent.
You could make it a condition of you helping pay for rent that she go to therapy for whatever it is that's causing her to need some sort of coping mechanism.
She does go to therapy.
A psychiatrist prescribed meds.
She didn’t like the meds.
She said she can only feel “normal” with pot.
So the therapist told her to smoke pot.
But there’s no control here.
It’s not a prescription.
She just heard what she needed to hear, and smokes tons of pot.
I don’t want my sister to live on the street.
I’m her big brother.
Conditions and ultimatums are useless, though I appreciate your desire to help.
Tbf those people would live that life even if they couldn’t get weed.
The weed is just the ketchup on their fries.
It’s definitely it the cause of laziness and deflection in trash people, it’s just their easy to get vice.
Oh yeah, absolutely.
She’s been a pothead for nearly thirty years.
The difference now is that she’s got a therapist who approves of it as a coping mechanism.
Which is a decent remedy for some folks I’ve known.
But if that coping strategy does more harm than good, it’s not really a good strategy.
Oh I know, and I do.
I’m more concerned with these things growing in legitimacy in the collective consciousness.
When states started legalizing weed, it sort of became mainstream that weed was no big deal.
I want the same for shrooms.
