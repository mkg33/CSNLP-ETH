If Russia is destroyed and divided, I would argue that would make the region even more of a threat to global peace.
If you have a Yugoslavia/Syria style collapse, you have various warlords fighting over resources, ideology, ethnicity and religion.
But with Russia, it would be extremely difficult to stop these warlords from getting their hands on various fractions of the Russian nuclear arsenal, which would dramatically increase the risk of nuclear exchange.
And certainly some of these warlords would be willing to sell some of the nukes to the highest bidder, throwing the existing balance of power into chaos world wide with even just the paranoia that any nation or well funded group could have a nuke now, let alone actual bad actors getting nukes.
As someone who works at a bank, there absolutely usually is a fee to transfer money between banks internationally - in the UK it’s typically £25.
You’re mistaking it for a card payment where typically its down to how you choose to have the exchange rate worked out (i.e by the merchant or your bank) but other than an exchange fee of a couple quid, there’s no real fee for transacting internationally.
Some banks even offer no fee for transactions in certain areas (e.g I think Monzo allows for no fees in Europe, Starling is the same for US?
).
