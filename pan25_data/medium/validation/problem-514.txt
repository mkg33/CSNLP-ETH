The state of Georgia has a somewhat unique system in that a grand jury must be convened to make a determination of fact for a criminal referral, but that same jury cannot make an indictment.
For that the referral goes to a different grand jury to issue a criminal indictment.
It's an old system of checks and balances.
The reason the report has been delayed (note: it is delayed and NOT suppressed or forever unavailable) is to both protect the state's case and also any potential defendants' rights.
Once the indicting grand jury has completed its work then the report from the first will be released.
