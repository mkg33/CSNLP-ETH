Seeing as how Palestinian supporters are so critical of war crimes, yes although this will quickly be swept under the rug while they whine about Israel.
Shooting unarmed medics and civilians is ALSO a warcrime, Israel is gonna have to employ military forces on these fuckheads to save civilians and the holy place that is Jerusalem(before you ask yes I am Jewish).
And how easy is it to turn kids into terrorists if they grow up regularly experiencing bombardements?
What the Hisbollah did here is despicable.
But this is one of the rare instances where the leadership of both sides can kindly fuck of in roughly equal measure.
Agreed.
But the other side targets them.
Look up the average age of inhabitants of the Gaza Strip, and think about it the next time you hear of Israeli bombs in that area.
I think BB is a shit bag, I think the right wing coalition that’s in charge of Israel once more conflict, I think they’re overly aggressive, and I think peace is going to be damn near impossible, while they still have power.
But despite that, I don’t think they are equally as fucked up.
You don’t see spokes people for Israeli leader, ship, celebrating, direct murder of teenagers.
You see them killing journalists, advancing illegal settlements and creating a de facto ghetto where even the basic needs cannot be met.
You also saw them assault a hospital a few days ago, without ever producing evidence that they had a reason to.
They don't do one horrible thing the other side does, because it's a asymetrical conflict.
That's true.
They still do enough fucked up shit to be just as bad.
I wasn't talking about this specific shooter.
My point is that by forcing people to live under the condition the Gaza Strip, you're making it easy for Hisbollah to find angry young people.
Then compare it to Gaza for the last 30 where all of the above and literacy have improved.
Where they have a mall, car dealerships and until hammas destroyed it a water park.
So you think you can drop a bomb on an densely populated area like Gaza and the half of the people that is under 18 will definitely be safe?
Cause if not, you're targeting them when youre releasing that bomb.
Defends itself ... Yeah right.
You think BB doesn't benefit from this?
You think he's not fanning the flames to unite his voters against a common enemy?
You think he's not trying to distract from his corruption charges?
Now don't get me wrong, the Hisbollah are despicable, and this shooting proofs that (if there was ever any doubt).
But claiming Israel was only ever defending itself just shows you have no grasp on the complexity of the situation.
Israel assaulted a hospital a few days ago, killing 9 people, causing a halt of operations and not giving any proof that there was any just cause for the attack.
But if you think for one second that Netanjahu cares that half the people in the Gaza Strip are legally children, you are incredibly naive.
His right wing government is fanning the flames, because he likes to present himself as the strong man, and has to divert attention from his corruption charges.
If you bomb an area like the Gaza Strip, you are de facto targeting children.
What you just assume that half of the population that is younger than 18 makes it to the bunkers in time?
Do I know for sure that thats not true?
I don't.
But the burden of proof has to be on the guy throwing the bomb.
You'd better be damn sure your killing the right people, and you'd better be able to proof it.
Israeli security forces attacked a hospital in the past few days, and killed 9 people there.
One of whom was supposedly an "extremist" whatever that means.
It isn’t just Palestine and Israel.
Every surrounding Arab country, including ones that have made peace, on paper with Israel, in some way, shape or form support this type of terrorism.
And since the government Israel never does that, and has a history of not cooperating with international inquiries, I'm going to assume the military leadership is full of shit, just as we know their new government is.
What’s really messed up about it, is that lots of times these countries treat Palestinians as garbage.
They all went to war with Israel, when it was formed, under a general, who wanted to push all the Jews into the sea.
Subsequently, they’ve all pretty much ethnically cleansed, all that use in their countries, who have largely become Israeli citizens, meanwhile, Palestinian “refugees” who are born in the same town their parents, and often grandparents were born, are still not citizens of the countries they were born in.
From 48 to 67.
There is no attempt to make Palestine a state.
I I’m not saying this to Tryon, excuse terrorism, but to point out this issue it’s not just Palestinian, it’s not just a Palestine Israel conflict, it’s much bigger than that.
Once any political group starts, making serious attempts at a peaceful path forward, they are going to be faced with internal terrorists that are heavily funded by every surrounding Arab state to continue the violence.
