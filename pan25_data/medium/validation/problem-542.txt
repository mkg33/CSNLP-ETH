Putin will literally fight until he has no military equipment left.
He's even getting so far as taking nuclear weapons out of BMs so they have some to use in Ukraine.
He's getting desperate.
I get what you're saying but let's not pretend there weren't Nazis willing to continue on until he offed himself.
That's what I worry about in Russia.
Until Putin is dead there will be people willing to follow his orders.
That said the fight in Ukraine won't end because one or two general tells his soldiers to stand down.
It will have to be nearly the entire military complex and at that point Poopy pants is as good as the fertilizer his soldiers have turned in to.
Whether it devolves into a civil war, history can answer that question.
Those cruise missiles that are having their warheads removed and replaced with lead ballasts are obsolete, they were never going to be used offensively.
Rather than dismantle them, they fire them at Ukraine and waste Ukrainian air defence missiles.
Fellow russians.
Welcome to year 10 of our 10 day long special military operation.
Everything is going fine.
We have gained a total of 30cm of ground this year and the ukranians are very very very very close to capitulating..
