It.
Takes.
Time.
You guys keep acting like an Abrams is a Honda Civic that you can just give to someone and drive it 200k miles.
You need an entire logistics and maintenance infrastructure and those need training.
All of that takes time.
I mean spare parts are always an issue, especially when it comes to electronics LRUs.
How do you give enough equipment and spare parts without affecting your own readiness?
You can't just go buy a fire control module or some other computer.
Yea, they had a mostly gutted Soviet style force back then.
The militias were necessary.
We could have intervened then, and even Obama has said we could have done more; but we couldn't have done them what we are doing now.
They will be a Modern, NATO standard military after this is done and the training, and doctrinal foundations of that shit (NCOs are kinda anathema to the Soviet model) takes time.
They've also beaten a lot of the corruption out of the system (and they still have work to) which also makes them more attractive partners.
