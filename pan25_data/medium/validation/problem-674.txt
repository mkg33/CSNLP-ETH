I think the greater point is this makes it twice now that an interception has led to parts falling in another country.
Russia is not doing a good job of keeping it's own toys away from other countries.
Ukraine is defending against more than a hundred missiles all over, aimed at trying to freeze the population, one missile overshooting a target is not their fault, its the one who made them fire.
Things are spilling over into other countries, this will absolutely escalate the involvement of Western powers.
So attacking infrastructure and supply lines there makes sense strategically.
Unfortunately itâ€™s still a war and there is always a chance of stuff like this.
Cooler heads just need to prevail before jumping the gun.
Supply lines come from the west.
Logically, Ukraine would use the furthest border to bring in western weapons and supplies.
can you show me supply lines or military infrastructure that was targeted in this recent wave of attacks?
Cause all I've been able to find are civilian power stations and homes.
