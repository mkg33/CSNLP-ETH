Its because that people dont really Care about democracy or the country, they Just support the Otherside wannabe dictator, unfortunately here in Brasil the people dont really want the progress of the country, they Just want to defend their criminal politician that they symphathize more and than It became a huge propaganda war that the Bolsonaro's supporters want to Prevent the comunism to spread across, making Lots of fake news and the Lula's supporters are acting like they are the most sanctified people in earth, always defending the rights of the people and shit like but in the shadows they are supporting lots of leftwings dictators around the world that makes tons of atrocities everyday and makes the exactly same things that the Bolsonaros supporters do.
both sides are equally corrupt and hypocritical.
This should happen every time after such an abhorrent event.
People need to show that they are not afraid of the fascists, that they are stronger than them and that the fascists are a minority that does not speak for everyone.
Brazil has fairly active left-wing movements still, that consistently protest and make noise.
From union alliances to land reformist rural workers to socialist organizations.
They usually help direct and organize whenever something big happens.
