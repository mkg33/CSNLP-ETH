These cases are interesting.
Ji wasn't American, might've set of alarm bells trying to enlist in the US.
Expect to an upcoming Netflix movie...

I get that this kind of espionage is a big deal, but it's literally stealing ideas, not creating terrorism cells or poisoning democracy (like Russia does).
Ji was eventually arrested in September 2018 after he met with an undercover US law enforcement agent who posed as a representative of China's Ministry of State Security (MSS).
During those meetings, Ji had explained that with his military identification he could visit and take photos of aircraft carriers.
He added that once he obtained his US citizenship and security clearance, he would seek a job at the CIA, FBI or Nasa.
>Earlier this month, former General Electric employee Zheng Xiaoqing was given a two-year sentence in the US for passing confidential information from his employers to the Chinese government.
Stealing military technology can lead to weapons being used against us.
Are you seriously saying stealing blueprints for aircraft carriers are not a national security risk?
