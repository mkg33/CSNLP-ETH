How's Iraq doing these days?
I feel like everyone forgot about it in the shit-show that has been Afghanistan lately and with Russia's bloodthirsty invasion.
Thankfully the situation has massively improved since the defeat of ISIS, with the country finally being stable.
We solved our political deadlock situation last year and finally have a stable government, and Iraq’s economy is growing at a stable rate finally.
A lot of it is pretty safe with a lot of my family finally going back and visiting again as well lol.
That is great to hear some optimistic news in the world!
I hope things continue to stabilize and improve in the years to come for your family and the country.
The answer might be long and I’m just super busy right now but will edit the full answer into this comment when home!
Apologies for the incredibly late comment.
To understand the current state of ISIS’s ideology, one must understand the context of Iraq overall when it comes to religion, values, and ideology.
This is going to be an incredibly long comment and I will include a TLDR at the bottom in case you’d like to skip to the main answer haha.
It was only 1993 with the severe sanctions on us, that Islam became the state’s religion and it was only then that the government took initiatives to make people more religious (my parents both left around this time due to the sanctions).
The government did this to prevent Saudi-funded Islamist rebellions in Iraq.
Even then, people were still generally more relaxed with religion up until after the Iraq War, where sectarianism and Islamist groups began filling the power vacuums.
From 1932 until 1993, we were a secular country and were relatively liberal for the region, whether it be men and women being equal by law, to heavy initiatives to fund and educate the overall populace.
Generally, religious extremism has been rare in the overall history of our country and the rise of Islamism/Jihadism was a relatively recent phenomenon in our country.
As an example, my mom and literally all her family members along with my aunt’s on my dad’s side grew up without wearing hijab, as wearing the hijab was much more rare at the time.
Moving onto ISIS, ISIS was able to gain initial power due to the Syrian Civil War, and after accumulating enough power, moved back into Iraq with significant more power.
As well, there are other factors.
Such as initial support of the repressed Sunni Arabs, when ISIS was relatively unknown during 2013 (they were viewed as liberators against the repressive Shia-based government).
This turned out to be the biggest mistake as they had no idea what was in store.
As well, much of the Iraqi Army was corrupt at the time and just fled rather than fought ISIS, which allowed ISIS to gain significant swathes of territory.
Though ISIS’s leadership were mainly Iraqi and Syrian, a huge part of their numbers came from foreign recruits.
Things really did start to change after the US dismantled our old government and installed a brand new Iraqi government in 2004, and rather than choosing to support secular and moderate politicians, the US instead supported very pro-Shia/pro-sectarian politicians.
This caused grievances between the Sunnis and Shias, which caused a religious-sectarian civil war war in the mid-late 2000s.
As well, the new Shia-based committed various grievances and human rights abuses against the Sunni population, which further radicalized the Sunni populous and gave way for the conditions of ISIS to rise.
Anyways, conditions under ISIS-ruled parts were absolutely horrid and miserable, and at that point, the populous of literally any city ruled under ISIS would have welcomed the Iraqi army.
In the end, the conflict had unified much of Iraq as it took literally everything for us to rid Iraq of ISIS.
Given how miserable things were under ISIS, they enjoy barely any support at all and their ideas and ideology are incredibly in the minority of the people.
The entire Iraqi army was revamped to prevent the same thing from happening.
Nowadays, there are small pockets of ISIS hideouts in the Iraqi deserts but attacks are usually neutralized right away.
Memories of ISIS have certainly played a role in turning more people away from religion and I doubt that any Iraqi would want to experience such horror again.
TLDR: ISIS as an actual organization and entity is permanently defeated and gone.
The ideology of ISIS and Islamic extremism within Iraq are rare in Iraq and are relatively recent phenomenons (beginning 2000s).
As well, ISIS was able to conquer so much due to external conditions and power vacuums, rather than it being due to mass support from the populous.
Given this, it has been easier to combat the ideology of ISIS as there is not support for it at all.
There’s still a small American presence there helping to hold down the country.
Iraq collapsed pretty much the same way Afghanistan did after our initial withdraw.
We sent a bunch of our guys back in and more or less stabilized the country again.
It’s still pretty dysfunctional and I suspect that the US will have a low level troop presence there for decades.
Kind of funny, post the US invasion at no point has the level of power generation, percentage of population with access to healthcare, or amount of drinking water produced risen to the level it was under Saddam.
Somehow we managed to make things worse than under Saddam Hussane.
Tell me the Iraq war wasn’t pointless.
Edit: down vote me all you want but that doesn’t change the facts, infrastructure post-US invasion never recovered to the same level as under Saddam and we killed almost as many civilians as Saddam did.
