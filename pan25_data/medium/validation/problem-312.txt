It's a classic trauma response.
We all know about "fight or flight", but there's also the "freeze" and "fawn" responses.
The "fawn" response is a common one with abuse victims, especially child abuse - they just do whatever they can to placate the abuser.
They say whatever they can to make it stop.
They try to be as pliable and submissive as possible to not be a target of the abuser's rage.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

100% agree on what you say about abuse killing who someone is - that's how I describe it when I talk about being sexually assaulted.
I physically survived, but the person who I was disappeared afterwards.
Whoever I could have become, that person died before I had a chance to find out.
