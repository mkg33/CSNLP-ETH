It will also be something that we won’t be able to solve by helping people where they are.
It will turn into literal resource wars and boarders will become armed to prevent immigration.
Personally blame can and should be placed on the smugglers, but they’re a symptom of the wider problem and not the cause.
This issue (illegal immigration) is going to get worse over the next several decades.
Africa, Asia, and Latin America/Caribbean have young populations that are in need of work.
Climate change will make them go hungry and/or destroy what little they have.
IMO the best solution is to help them where they are.
This can’t create change immediately but it’ll slow the flow of migration if young folks have a reason to stay wherever they are.
I know this is psynical, but what are they going to do in Europe?
It's so hard for them to find jobs, so who else is going to cover their living cost than the taxpayers of the EU?
What jobs are you talking about?
Again, I know it's psynical but we need SKILLED labour and people educated in STEM.
otherwise, we'll be paying for them.
