They behave as if promoting Christianity gets people to give them a good credit rating just for being part of the club.
Christianity to them is a badge of superiority.
Wear it and it makes you special, no need to actually follow through with actually being Christlike.
But luckily for civilization, the fastest-growing religion in America is no religion at all.
Only 45% of Americans have attended church for the bare minimum of Christmas and/or Easter.
Guarantee you that at least 63% of Millennials and Gen Z’ers (the percentage nationwide who voted against Republicans in the 2022 Midterms, with only 25% of those same age demos voting for Republican) will be turned off by someone if that person declared to be a devout Christian in the political arena.
This tactic of claiming Christian moral superiority has successfully worked for many, many generations.
And to an extent, it’s still working with the Baby Boomers.
However, it has significantly lost its appeal within the past 10-15 years.
Especially since the 1 reason why Americans (especially younger Americans) don’t go to church is because of the church’s negative attitudes and treatment against LGBTQ+ and women (especially reproductive rights).
“Oh, so you’re into forcing preteens to birth their rape babies, criminalizing my gay and trans friends, and burning Dr. Seuss books, huh?
Hard pass.”.
That’s part of it.
Republicans love to use Christianity because it gives them an instant win morally.
They can look at any situation and claim whatever they did as the right and moral thing because they’re Christians and walk with god!
By default they feel special and better than anyone else.
