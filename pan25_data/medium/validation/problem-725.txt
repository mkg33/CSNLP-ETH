That's cause those people are jealous he didn't give it to them, lol they're jealous of either his success, his talent or his money so they come out with this garbage to make themselves feel better... For some fd up reason.
“You did something really good, but you didn’t do it for the right reasons” is such a weird hill to die on.
I find it hard to believe Amazon losing value would tank the American economy.
If the American economy tanked so would the world.
Amazon has competition as Alibaba etc.
I find it hard to believe the entire world economy would collapse because of Amazon losing value.
not that anyone should test that.
Who has he been an asshole to besides other NBA players?
He has always been very charitable.
He donated his entire season's salary after 9/11 to relief funds.
.
I challenge you to name 1 athlete who has given more to charity than Michael Jordan.
This is not trying to dismiss the contributions of any of those people and the work that they have done, but they have not donated more of their personal wealth to charity than Michael Jordan has.
Michael Jordan has literally done as much or more than anybody ever has in his position, yet you still feel the need to shit on him.
I can't understand what kind of miserable person you are to react this way to this news.
And yeah, he probably hasn't spent as much time volunteering for the Make-A-Wish foundation as John Cena, who holds the record for the most wishes granted ever.
But in terms of money given away to actual charities I believe he is unmatched in the world of sports.
I don't understand how miserable you must be to see someone doing something like this and somehow turning it into a negative.
I just find it strange to focus on the negatives when someone just made a "largest in history" charity donation.
He is not required to donate either his time or money, but still chooses to be very generous with what he does for charity.
He may not be the friendliest person out there, but by no means is he a bad person.
I am not aware of him ever being in trouble with the law or anything like that.
Again, I have trouble with someone digging hard to find something negative in regards to a story like this.
And yeah your other examples of Tiger Woods and Lance Armstrong are Nike athletes as well, so your critism of Nike manufacturing practices applies to them as well.
