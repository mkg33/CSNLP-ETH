I am staunchly pro-choice, but one would have to be delusional to truly think that having an abortion is merely a minor medical procedure like any other.
Terminating a pregnancy is not the same thing as having a mole removed from your backside.
For many women, it is a traumatic experience and more than a few end up dealing with strong feelings of guilt, or even remorse, after having one.
Making sure that every would-be patient has a chance to have all the information they need, has a chance to have all their questions answered before they put on the hospital gown, and is compelled to spend a few days making sure it is the right decision for them before they step into the clinic for the procedure seems pretty reasonable.
The protestors want to protest in front of counseling centers (similar to Planned Parenthood in the US, but not necessarily with the medical treatment option).
The actual abortion will take place at a doctorâ€˜s office or a hospital, but in Germany it is mandatory to get counseling (which has to be result-neutral) so that there can be an informed decision about the abortion, and a mandatory three-day wait before performing the abortion.
To get the abortion, the woman must present proof that she has been to counseling.
