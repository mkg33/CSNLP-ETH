Still trying to get a guy that didnt win?
Just curious on the mentality of the people in this sub.
Our economy was doing good, on par when clinton was in office.
There was no stupid wars to siphon tax payer dollars to besides afghanistan which was winding down slowly.
Im sorry but the real person we need to be concerned about is the one in office right now.
The odds of trump getting reelected is minimal at best but our economy will not sustain another four years of whos in office now.
Why dont we spend more time and energy trying to find a good candidate to run in the next term.
Dont care if they are dem or repub.
Just get us a good person to do the job.
In general, be courteous to others.
