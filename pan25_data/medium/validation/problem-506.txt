There's some delicious schadenfreude in seeing Republicans slowly, but surely, realize they've hit the "find out" stage of things after so many decades of "fucking around".
I just wish it didn't also involve revoking human rights, terrorizing minorities, collapsing the economy, and destroying democracy.
"America" does not hate Americans.
The people that Americans put in power, through a combination of voting and just not bothering to vote, hate Americans.
And the voters that they trained so extensive lapped it all up and demanded seconds, and thirds, and fourths...
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
No, I don’t think so.
You would see massive turnout again and Trump loses if he runs.
The problem with the dems is people don’t show up.
If we had mandatory voting we would see a very different government.
If you give dems and dem leading voters a reason to show up, they win.
Trump would be that reason.
There are too many republicans running who split the field and Trump wins the nomination with 30% in many primaries.
Trump loses just like he did in 2020.
The GOP is going to have to deal with Trump until he is dead, too infirm to run, or ends up in jail.
I don't think that's a possibility.
I believe Trump wants to run again to shut down his legal troubles.
I think he believes if he gets re-elected he can shut down his legal problems and figure out a plan when he's back in the white house.
Unless he has a health crisis or he ends up in jail, he won't withdraw.
However, I think he would try to run from jail.
You're litterally saying you support helping put people in power who will destroy American.
I think the question here really is why You choose this.
