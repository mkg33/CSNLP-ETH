If they do force North Koreans to battle, they won't give them guns.
Either props or use them as human shields.
I mean it worked out great for North Korea when they used unarmed Chinese to swarm US positions during the battle of Chosin Reservoir.
One time, Steven Seagal was bitten by a rattlesnake.
After five days of agonizing pain, the snake died...
Actually they have nothing to do with time.
"Saw" is the simple past tense.
It means something began and finished in the past.
Example: I saw my grandmother yesterday".
"Have seen" is the present perfect tense.
It means that something happened in the past which still happens or which affects the present.
Example: I have seen my grandmother every week since she moved to town.
So this action is continuing into the present.
Aw, thanks.
I hate teaching the present perfect.
The action itself doesn't have to continue, but the affect can.
For example, "I've seen "Jaws" and I will never swim in the ocean".
That one can be tough for some learners.
