What the media fails to mention is that Congress can also force the rail companies to take a deal.
So how about we force these greedy fucks to give these hard working people the time off flexibility they deserve?
But who am I kidding, this is Congress, so they’ll side with the corporations guaranteed.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
He's not a pro-labor president then.
Fucking simple as that.
Man, I was proud of my vote for Biden a month ago.
Now I'm not so sure.
Good job Biden.
You're alienating a large majority of the people who voted for you for political and economical optics.
Also a really disgusting moment for Joe Biden; he had the opportunity to push for workers’ rights, and he’s folding mainly out of fear of political backlash.
Really a sad moment of cowardice when these workers really needed a voice to support them.
Anyone who believed Joe Biden was anything other than a corporatist centrist simply wasn't paying attention or was suffering from a carbon monoxide leak in their house...
He was elected because he wouldn't rock the boat AND he wasn't Trump.
Nothing more nothing less.
