Even i was closer to the frontline than putin.
Im from Kharkiv, Saltivka district.
Its district russians attacked first, i personally heard melee fight in 1-2 kilometres from me, saw missiles flying above me, was under shelling and bombs and after few months under drones attack.
Millions of ukrainians were and even now is on my place too, so putin is a joke.
And thats why we need long range weapons.
To show putin how it is to be on frontline.
To make him feel how it is.
Well, Yes and no.
You make it sound like they resorted to drafting every last One they can get, when really they haven't even started seriously drafting/mobilisation yet.
Unlike Ukraine which has gone full mobilisation immediately.
Most of Russias potential manpower is still sitting at home.
So, desperation only in the sense that Putin fears the potential backlash of more mobilisation.
But if Ukraine keeps on striking within Russia, there is a Chance the Population gets behind him, and that would be a Problem.
This button doesn't exist in Ukraine.
Russia does have a metaphorical button like this, but they don't dare use it against Ukraine for the global beatdown Russia would receive, even from their supposed allies.
