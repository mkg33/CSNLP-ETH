Taiwanese had 11 extra months to adapt to the new regulation and yet the DPP government did nothing but horseshit.
Now they're bitching about CHINA BAD.
For anyone who reads Japanese, this is what the Japanese government told its people about what to do with the new regulation in 2021 :
In reality, Taiwan's FDA not only made the announcement in Oct 2021, it also set up a dedicated page ( to get vendors updated to the new compliance requirements.
According to the article, not only was there a dedicated registration site, they held 7 workshops for vendors to explain the situation in person.
As to why they only did this in Oct, the article shows that they were waiting for China for further details, as can be seen in the table, where different categories of vendors under different registration statuses were afforded different treatment, and China's response was received on 13th Oct.
What China fails to understand because it is a completely foreign concept, is Taiwan has a popular, democratically elected government.
So when it wants to punish Taiwan or other country it just pisses off the majority of the population as well.
Who just double down and have more contempt and dislike for China.
Don't believe everything you read online.
There is a smearing campaign against Taiwan trying to create the impression that the government did nothing.
