Mahsa Amini was from the Kurdish region.
Besides that, brutally cracking down on the protests here could trigger a more violent response from the Kurds.
This would allow the Iranian regime to frame their crackdown on the protests as cracking down on "Kurdish separatists".
There are many reasons to this, one being that the border provinces are the only ones with limited access to smuggled guns, second is that Baluchistan is undoubtedly the poorest province in Iran.
Kurdish towns being more economically capable started widespread strikes which got the government scared, because Strikes spread countrywide.
Therefore the Kurdish towns were the first town in Iran which received direct Military response by IRGC.
Videos of IRGC shooting Rifle and machine guns directed at people became viral on social media in the last couple of days.
Government claims they were fighting the ‘’Terrorists’’, but no one believes them.
Dozens are dead or injured.
There is also videos of them stealing people’s valuable goods and damaging their properties Which unsurprisingly government blames the terrorists for once again.
If they drop the hijab law, then any other protests can be identified as political factions causing trouble.....but they are stupid so probably nothing will change.
