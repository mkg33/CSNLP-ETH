Well, there's one for the window maker, another for the street sweeper, a third for the interior decorator; and of course, if the bullets damage any appliances that'll mean more jobs even for the foreigners we buy our goods from.

Oh that's easy, both things proportionally hurt Democrats more.
Felons tend to live in high population density areas and those areas tend to vote Democrat.
It is therefore statistically more likely that a felon will vote Democratic than Republican.
Democratic voters also have a tendency to vote for or against a candidate based on their history and policies.
Unfortunately for us, the worst Republican voters have no such standard.
The problem in the US is that our felons are disproportionately from minority (especially black) communities and most minority populations in the US lean Democratic.
Another large segment of our felon population is from people who live in low income areas in cities and while these areas are less blue than the middle income area in cities, they still lean blue.
Another huge factor in all of this is that prisoners count for electoral purposes toward the population of the county and state the prison is in, regardless of whether the prisoners held there would otherwise reside in the same state (e.g.
a California native held in an Iowa prison counts toward Iowa's numbers rather than California's).
Felons can't vote in most (maybe all?)
states even when out of prison, so a thing that happens is that very conservative districts get gerrymandered to have prisons within them so that the relatively small conservative power base in rose districts hold power in a really shady way.
