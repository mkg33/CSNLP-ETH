I feel like he’s being bombastic for clicks, eyeballs and to try and draw attention and engagement to Twitter.

Elon is somewhere between a far Alt right figure and a foreign agent at this point (it’s hard to know the difference).
Twitter was on the declining end of its trajectory-- young people are not widely using it anymore.
His tantrums will be briefly newsworthy, but he bought a jalopy with rust spots and 100K+ miles.
Elon is just an alt-right troll now.
When he says he’s a free speech absolutist he only means for himself and the voices he likes.
Twitter was the toy everyone wanted there for a period.
So Elon bought it.
Now he’s clearly having regrets and I hope it drags him down.
