This is how Russia has fought almost every one of their wars historically, and I wish analysts that came out and predicted this conflict unfolding exactly how it is had gotten more exposure.
Russians never have a positive ratio with their service members, they always rely on easy to replace/mass produced equipment and have no problem throwing wave after wave until they slowly steamroll and exhaust their opponents.
This strategy has horrifically worked against them.
They had severe demographic problems before Ukraine for doing the exact same thing in Afghanistan.
They do not have the population to throw away in their army and maintain anything remotely resembling the economic forces needed to support one.
And with the wave of rampant xenophobia Russia has deliberately built and encouraged around the world, those refugees are themselves going to have a hard time.
Particularly when combined with how Russia will use those people's families as collateral to force them to be part if its ongoing espionage and sabotage efforts.
I'm hoping in another 50 years we have a Russia that has as hostile of an attitude towards authoritarianism as Germany does today.
But that required outside intervention, and a long period of direct management and reconstruction by other countries that I think Russia's never going to get.
The irony will be that some Russians leaving Russia well tell people they are Ukrainian as the average Joe couldn't tell the difference and will treat them kindly if they are Ukrainian and poorly if they are Russian.
Man, it must suck so bad to be Russian right now.
I just wish I could say that I couldn't blame them for every step of the way, because at the end of every day Putin has stayed in power because the Russian people have decided to allow it.
It's the same questions of how to treat the German people during the aftermath of WW2, recognizing that their position sucks but that they remain responsible for it.
However, overall experience is extremely weird right now and there’s tons of people who lost their mind.
Even though I never experienced any negative reaction to where I’m from I still prefer to avoid this topic until I’m asked directly and yes, I avoid making acquaintances with Russian speaking strangers if they have at least minor accent.
