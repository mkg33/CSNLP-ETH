would be nice but it would be too much of a lose of life.
Russian are doing poorly because they can't keep up with logistics - some of the worst stories we are hearing are coming from Russian regiments that have more or less been abandoned .
No food , running low on ammo if they even have working rifles at all , vehicles out of gas or broken so can't even evacuate / retreat properly .
So they start kicking in civilian doors and raiding and looting and are basically bandits with no command structure at that point.
You put them back in their area with their people and closer to their supplies and good supply chains and its an entirely different battle of well feed , well armed Russians defending their homes and could very well bolster the entire war.
Russians dont want to kill their neighbors but they sure as hell would defend their home/ country .
Since around the start of the war, yeah.
These mines, other mines, booby traps in civilian homes, booby traps on bodies, artillery against evac corridors...
