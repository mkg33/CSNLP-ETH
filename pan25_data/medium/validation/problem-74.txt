You are mistaken, India did not condemn US directly, as the founder of non-alignment group since Cold war India has always been anti-war and on the side of peaceful resolution but never condemned any nation directly (Except Pakistan and China for obvious reasons).
India did however condemned Iraq war (it did not call it an invasion officially).
It is exactly same now with Russia-Ukraine situation.
No it isn't, that's the entire point.
India has NOT done the same with Russia.
India refused to take the same stances when it came to Russia's invasion - it abstained when it came to voting in the UN, and it's leaders will not criticize.
>Indiaâ€™s abstention was in keeping with its voting posture on all substantive Ukraine-related resolutions since the war began.
It's basically saying that the US should not invade Iraq.
Modi did something similar by telling Putin to end the war.
Trade with the invading nations increased in both cases.
But it's not a failure in having a central point of diplomatic contact for all nations, however toothless.
You hear of things that go on at the UN.
You hear of the votes and reports commissioned there.
That knowledge is worldwide and in that is not a failure.
