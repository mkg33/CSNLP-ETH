Nice one.
Now they've just made sure that everyone will remember why they thought they had to change, and most people will still associate the problem they thought they had to change.
They can change the word.
This just further linked the wrong meaning they want people to stop thinking.
Mainly because no other disease is likely to change its name based on reference to an ethnicity or nationality.
Good job.

No they’re not.
What kind of problems are you implying people who get offended by anything, whether you or I see it as ridiculous or not, are causing?
They talk too much, or tell you to stop talking too much, and you find it annoying?
I haven’t known of a single person — not family, not friends, not colleagues, not anyone.
Anyone that would associate monkeys with black humans is the actual racist.
Sounds like that’s something the WHO is about.
The problem is what you find offensive and what I find offensive are not the same.
Who are you to tell me what I can't say because you are weak and your feeling get hurt.
You can't offend me.
Words don't hurt.
I can only imagine how you handle real pain.
Calling people weak does not make you strong, nor does it make you right.
And quite telling that you assume anybody who disagrees with you must therefore be offended and a weak cupcake.
Changing the name and asserting monkeys are associated with a particular group or demographic is the only thing that seems racist or hateful here.
The non-musical WHO needs to just stop.
