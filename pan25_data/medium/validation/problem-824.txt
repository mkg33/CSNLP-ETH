We'll outside of schools we have police and soldiers that are armed performing active shooter drills, preparing for war, etc.
Schools are places people die just as people die outside of schools.
We are not sending a good message to children when school staff is armed and conducting active shooter drills.
We're telling them schools are dangerous places to be, places they may die, and more kids are going to be struggling with school phobia/PSTD.
I get what you're trying to say, but maybe the impression that schools are incapable of violence and safe havens is the wrong approach.
Anything that prevents school shootings (not sure what that may be) would improve overall safety everywhere.
If children have started believing that it means adults have gone out of their way to actively deceive them.
Has to be the case if they are actually terrified because that shit is an extreme outlier.
In my time at school Sandy Hook happened more people at my school died from alcohol poisoning, car accidents, 3 suicides one from walking onto a highway and two from walking in front of trains, and one from a congenital heart defect that they were unaware of.
None died from mass shootings.
Not at my school or any nearby schools.
Which I am pretty sure is the experience the vast, vast majority of students have.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Are we?
When I did fire drills I didn't think the school was going to burst into flames, when we had earthquake drills I didn't think the school would be torn apart, when we had active shooter drills I didn't think it was ever really going to happen.
The message I got is that we go through the motions just in case something ever actually happened, not that it meant we are in constant danger.
No, I am pretty sure that was the standard mindset.
When the active shooter drills it was time to screw around.
Nobody was scared.
I am pretty sure it is most don't think about it.
Unless of course like I said adults are going out of their way to deceive or traumatize the kids to make them think they happen more than they do and that they are at significant risk.
But nothing prevents this from happening now right?
I'm assuming a teacher could go all day without having their purse checked for a gun or waist if they have it concealed in person.
While arming teachers maybe wont reduce shooters at school, I think believing it will contribute to more violence doesn't really add up either.
