Anyone who claims that isn't an expert.
Tanks are built for a purpose according to specific needs.
This makes it impossible to have a "finest" MBT.
There is no number 1, just a bunch of really good tanks.
They're good tanks, heavily depending on the version of course, but they're absolutely not the best tank in the world.
Hell, they don't have an APS system on them, while others like the M1A2 SEPv3 and Merkava do.
Hard to even be in consideration for best tank in the world with no APS...
There is something to be said for the M1A2 being refined by a lot more combat experience and with full blowout panel protection on both the hull and turret.
It's a lot less likely to launch a turret like the leopard does.
The Leopard is not likely to launch a turret even with a direct hit to the munitions department.
Simply because the ammo stored there is really really hard to ignite.
Ultimately the M1 has all of it's ammunition isolated and the Leopard does not.
It's still a much lower risk for the M1 and the ammunition has a high enough risk of a catastrophic explosion that isolated ammunition is a thing.
If that was not a concern the ammo in the leopard's turret would not be protected.
Both have their advantages, it's a interesting comparison with M1 maybe having an advantage in more basic things like crew survivability, optics, practical aspects.
The latest leopards do have a lot of new features though and I think the thermal optics got upgraded at some point.
Can't really go wrong either way.
Do you have any reference for the combustible case 120mm being really hard to ignite though?
Seems like it's going to be about the same as any cased ammunition.
No, I got it from talks in the Panzermuseum in Munster.
Feel free to send them an email, I am sure they will answer your question.
