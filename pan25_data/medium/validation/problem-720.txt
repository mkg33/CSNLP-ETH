They have drills for insurgencies, they train to land jets on highways incase airfields are destroyed.
They think outside the box for sure.
They have hardened bunkers around the islands.
The best defense for Taiwan is being so highly armed that the PRC won't even risk its invasion, as otherwise the latter will just double & triple down once attacking.
Ironically, that deterrence is also the cheapest option given the sheer destruction an invasion would bring, aside from Taiwan ceasing to be independent.
Thats not the current taiwan defense strategy .
Like japan they put all their money on their defense treaty with america.
Yes, the most dangerous thing Taiwan and the US have done for world peace is allowing Taiwan to start falling dangerously behind China militarily.
Not that the Taiwan military can go toe to toe with China, but from what I've read over the last 10 years it seems as though even the asymmetric deterrent capabilities of Taiwan have been falling behind.
Hopefully Ukraine is the wake up call both the US and Taiwan need.
Taiwans defense strategy does not include beating China.
It is to stall china for 2 weeks so the US can get in the war.
Thats all.
