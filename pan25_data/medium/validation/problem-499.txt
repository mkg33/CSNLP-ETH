Moldova is very vulnerable with the illegal Transnitria enclave within its borders, Putin will do all it can to undermine and sabotage Moldova.
It's what his gangster regime are good at.
One constant of the universe is that fascist autocrats (including the wannabees) will always be guilty of what they accuse others of doing.
Every single time.
And what would those troops be doing?
Russia is fomenting protests and using cyber attacks.
Those aren’t exactly problems you can shoot your way out of.
Man, you made me have to think, social studies was state history 7th grade for me, geography was high school 10th grade I think.
I remember that class pretty well because, well a couple things, but anything I didn't know the answer to I put down "the great wall of china".
I don't think the teacher got the humor in putting that as the answer for the capital of some s. american country or such.
So the plan would be for NATO to send troops to Moldova to fight Russian soldiers in Transnistria even though there isn’t any actual fighting going on?
Doesn’t sound like a great plan.
