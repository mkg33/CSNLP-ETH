Debt is industry specific.
A business that requires extreme capital to enter and whose product is economically critical can carry much higher debt than the typical publicly traded company.
For these types of businesses, there is less likely to be new entrants into the market and they are likely to be subsidized by the government when necessary.
Publicly traded companies go under all the time.

The large R&D spending has resulted in actual innovation like Hydrogen engines and Small-Modular Nuclear reactors that will go into production in the next 5 years and on top of this they are continuing to reduce their massive debt levels.
