Zoidberg is in that uncomfortable position of being too intelligent to be one of their patsies, but not evil enough to be one of their leaders.
Really, the only thing heâ€™s got going for him is his complete incompetence in his supposed area of expertise.
...because he's the only person who has declared he's running.
Normally people don't announce candidacy until about a year and a half before the election.
It's far more likely that Trump announced his candidacy because the DOJ has a general policy of handling political candidates with kid gloves before an election, and he's hoping he can get all the criminal investigations into his conduct to get swept under the rug.
One would hope, with at least three public criminal investigations and signs that the DOJ is absolutely done with his shit, that the only "voting" people will be doing with regard to Trump will occur in small rooms of twelve votes each.
I feel like I keep seeing articles written as if the Trump years are behind us.
Meanwhile, he's about to shift into primary campaign mode and we're all going to be seeing him in the news every single fucking day again.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
That doesn't make me feel much better since Desantis is far more dangerous and gonna be a way bigger draw for moderate conservatives.
His base will still mindlessly follow him, and every single Republican will fall right in line supporting whatever craven shit flies out of his mouth.
The sight of Trump and sound of his voice makes me ill, but him running as the GOP candidate in '24 is the best shot at the dems holding down the oval office.
I agree that's a likely scenario, and makes me wonder what would have a bigger impact on lowering GOP voter turnout:
- Desantis wins nom and Trump gets his base to stay home while he screeches about election fraud (bonus if he runs as an Independent and splits the vote).
