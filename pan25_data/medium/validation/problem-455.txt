Because cancel culture in Russia is actually blooming and in past year reached several decades highest.
And if masses would know that he was gay believe me we would hear about attempts to cancel him from within.
No one made more damage to Russian culture that Russian state.
I understand the sentiment, but I can honestly say that listening to Swan Lake has never made me think, 'You know what, I love that Vladimir Putin guy.

Yeah, I'm working on a Khachaturian piece and there's no chance I'm dropping it.
Maybe I can give a performance benefiting Ukraine relief funds, but Aram Khachaturian was never about Putin.

People in those countries have seen their culture depressed and displaced.
So, I understand why now we see proactive policies like this one.
On the other hand, the pain is real, and I understand that suffering does not always produce rational attitudes.
