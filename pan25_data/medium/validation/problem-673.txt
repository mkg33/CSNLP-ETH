Not to guilt or shame at all, but as I wanna share it- for me I would rather die living as I am and loving me than die trying to appease the person cutting my throat to save a few more days for myself.
I know it is not easy or even always possible to feel the same, but I hope someday you can live your truth mo matter how terrifying it is and remain safe.
No matter your choice, you are still a precious member of the same community as me, and I and so many will love and support you regardless of your comfort with outwardly telling this sort of hate off to save your sanity and safety.
We have to protect our own and I refuse in a time like this to let people feel this pain of hiding without knowing someone knows the same struggle and supports them across the screen- even if it doesn't mean you feel ok to come out ever and even if you someday do feel ok to <3.
And that would be because the conservative areas aren't opposed to the limiting of LGBT+ students' rights while the liberal areas would be enforcing the rules?
