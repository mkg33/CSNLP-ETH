No, no they wont.
We're pretty much at price parity for EVs, which are much cheaper to run overall.
This is down to advances in design, scale etc.
By 2030 fossil powered vehicles will be made in lower numbers and have higher costs by a fair margin.
Price parity, really?
Most hybrid models in Europe cost 10-15K EUR more than the regular ones.
Plug-in hybrid / full-EV models are sometimes double the price.
On top of that, resale value of EV's is highly questionable due to batteries degrading.
I am all for lowering emissions, but EV's are not very affordable to many people.
People seem to always miss how technology scales and reduces costs.
This is like flat screen TVs that were $20-40k at the start and now you can barely give them away.
OK, so with the same money you can buy a shitty Chinese car with bad resale value and less safety/reliability or a decent one with a combustion engine.
I think most people would opt for the latter in your specific example.
I would not consider this price parity.
Compare different models from similar makers.
EV's have distinctly higher price positioning.
And it's not looking like EV's or cars will get cheaper soon because there are long waiting lists practically everywhere at the moment.
Maybe, but when it comes to purchasing decisions, particularly in the case of cars, brand familiarity is a significant factor.
The MG4 would be an odd decision even just for resale value, compared to a Mazda.
Yeah for equivalent vehicle types.
Base price for Bolt EV and Bolt EUV from Chevy is mid-range 20s, which is still higher than the gas-powered Trax and Trailblazer.
After options, it's well over $30k.
That's still upper middle-class for vehicle cost in the US.
Yes.
Not from the European manufacturers probably but certainly from the Chinese.
Compare say Mazda 3 vs MG4 etc.
Call me when you can start getting a decent trim package on a non-SUV/Truck/Van EV for sub $25k new.
Smaller European countries switching over to EVs will do nothing but provide good feelings if larger countries that are much more reliant on vehicle transportation have large swaths of their population still priced out from EVs a decade from now.
China is now over 30% EV for new vehicles.
They are the largest vehicle market.
US is also changing rapidly and will increase in speed with the IRA act etc.
Reliance on fossil fuels is a global issue.
If one country achieves price parity on EVs, it doesn't solve the problem globally.
oh sure apart from we have electricity just about everywhere and this will be a tiny fraction of the worlds copper use.
btw you realize a lot of DC chargers are now using aluminium cables right?
And that Aluminium is actually a better conductor?
Yeah because price of Ice will increase so there will be price parity.
But not even price is problem.
Charging infrastructure or almost non existing in East EU is bigger problem.
56% live in apartments, most of them in old commies blocks.
Noone was able to solve parking problem there in 30 years so I do not see how charging problem will be solved in 7.... People will not buy electric cars when they do not have way to charge it.
Not everyone is millionare to buy a house.
Housing prices are completely out of mind, now with ICE cars ban, cars pricing will be also out of mind, because demand for used ICE will increase and price of used cars too.
New generation are completely fk ed up.
They will have to use shared apartments nd shared cars lol.
No it is not easy.
What are you talking about?
There not enough parking space so there is no way someone will built enough EV charging points even slow AC.
You can not use existing infrastructure like public lighting because it was not build to handle load like this.
You have to built whole infrastructure from scratch.
Noone was able to solve parking problem in 30 years so there is no way someone would solve charging in 7 years.
This is just bad joke.
There is one light post per at least 20 cars.
Cables leading to light posts are not able to handle that much of load.
Transformers leading to cables are not able to handle that much of load.
Everything has to be built from scratch.
You can not build like one AC charging point for 20 cars lol.
Yes cars are parked maybe 90% of time, but do you know why traffic jams are created?
Because majority of cars are used in same time /going to school/work/ taking children somewhere/.
So majority of cars will be charging at the same time, there is no way current electricity system can handle this.
This is just utopia in Eastern EU, where cities were not able to built proper parking spaces next to commies block, so building charging station for each car is just dream.
cars are parked 90-95% of the time.
we already have kerb side ac chargers, chargers fitted to lightposts etc.
why, of all things, do people think we cant get electricity to a car when we manage to get it everywhere else?
