They can load him in a cannon and shoot him at the sun but it wonâ€™t bring back the people whose lives he destroyed or fix his brain.
He might as well have been a freak tornado or uncharted asteroid- just a natural disaster that arises from people living together in cities and needing to trust somebody to control a city bus.
He stripped off his clothes and started screaming after running full speed at it... No signs of skid marks from swerving or breaking.
As far as we know, he had no motive.
After 10 years driving a bus, he hears the call of the void and answers back.
What the fuck.
Where do we hit the sweet spot where we separate between a rational choice and mental illness?
If one can do horrible things, isn't he per definition less-than-human (without compassion, inhumane)?
I know, it's a bit far-fetched, I understand that we attribute personal choice as being almost supernatural.
But hear me out.
Is it just a diagnosis?
Diagnoses are just the medical worlds current best guess.
In 10 years we will have even more diagnoses to label people with, and will that move the bar for when a person is a lost cause?
