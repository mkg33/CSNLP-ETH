The Biden administration is weighing whether to postpone or cancel Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s upcoming trip to Beijing after detecting a Chinese surveillance balloon that was lingering at high altitude over sensitive nuclear sites in Montana.
Blinken was set to have meetings in Beijing early next week in the first such visit by a top US diplomat in five years.
But the presence of the balloon — which the Pentagon decided not to shoot down — has officials worried that going now would send the wrong signal, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing internal deliberations.
China sought to smooth over the incident Friday, with the Foreign Ministry saying it was “regretful” that a civilian airship entered US airspace because of forces beyond its control.
It said the balloon was conducting climate research.
The balloon was first spotted earlier this week and had been loitering over Montana, home to intercontinental-ballistic-missile silos, a senior Defense Department official said Wednesday.
The official said the balloon posed no intelligence threat and such incursions have happened before.

"Civilian"... okayyyy... we should just park a "civilian" aircraft carrier right between Taiwan and Beijing and say it belongs to Harvard (they could afford it) and it's just a shame they need to do research there for the next 20 years or so.
Obviously joking but "civilian" is just as silly.
