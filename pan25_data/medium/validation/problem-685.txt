Yes they were upping the fear factor any time someone one puked up on a plane and sending commenters into panic about it spreading to everyone on the plane.
They never wrote about it not being an airborne virus so unlikely to be sneezed all over the place.
Or the fact that shortly after getting it you're likely to be half dead and not likely to be getting down to the airport to catch a flight.
It makes people obviously ill fast, so people are more likely to be isolated sooner too.
I wonder how many of the Sun and Mail readers being wound up over ebola were also anti lockdown advocates.
Yes, honestly.
There are 5 different strands of Ebola, 4 pathogenic to humans, 1 to monkeys.
Ebola Reston is the monkey specific one.
While it has been found in human hosts, it doesnâ€™t cause illness.
The Reston strain is named for my hometown (Reston, VA)!
The book the Hot Zone covers it in great detail.
We used to have a lab there where they ran tests on monkeys infected with Ebola.
Ironically enough, the location is now a day care center.
