The Ukrainian military was too much for the Russians, so they are going to team up with the Chinese to pick on little Taiwan,, I hope that the Ukrainians take the war all the way to Moscow, annex European Russia and leave Russia with only Siberia,, that way the new Russians will return to caves and foraging like they were hundreds of years ago.
It's not about the significance, it's about making a big story about it in the media, during a period where talking about conflicts is popular and generates clicks.
The Chicago Convention was updated in 2000 with 'Recommended Practice' details regarding the use of and operations in an ADIZ.
That's the civil aviation international standard.
The ADIZ is just an additional identification requirement, but it's not legally binding and the zone itself confers no authority.
To be clear, I don't think any nation is required to submit to the ADIZ requirements so their military aircraft would not necessarily have to follow those rules, but I'm very certain that civil aviation is required to follow them and there are consequences for not doing so.
The term isn't defined in international law.
All but 20 countries don't even have air defense identification zones.
Countries that do draw them unilaterally in whatever shape they want, often overlapping the ADIZs of neighboring countries.
