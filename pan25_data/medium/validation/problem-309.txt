He’s been acting like Gaddafi imo, rampant ego, very little self-awareness, and convinced he can get away with absolutely anything.
It’s weirder than that, Mafias tend to keep people in charge who still have their head in the game.
Russian oligarchs and security services know that Putin’s private war against Zelensky (and, rather ambiguously; “the west”) is insane, and he’s been acting like he has a severe mental illness.

I do still completely acknowledge that the "after-Russia" is almost as scary, and if not more.
Having a guy openly threaten nukes because his war of aggression failed is pretty much current fear outweighing fear of the unknown.

But the amount of comments I see here or on other sites from Americans that truly believe THEY are NATO, or that THEY choose what happens in the world, is crazy.
its literally on a daily basis.
