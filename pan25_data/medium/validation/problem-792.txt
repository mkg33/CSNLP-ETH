No, wings and fuselage are not constructed as a single steel piece.
For one thing, that would make field repairs next to impossible.
It is few months ago.
In the beginning of September, they were still airworthy, as they had a public "goodbye" demo during the Slovak international air fest.
I was at the demo and 4 did the flyover (although that doesn't mean they are necessarily battle ready).
But there should be several more of them that are still good for parts.
They would still be good as parts planes even if most can't be flown.
Even just one salvaged jet engine off one is useful, until they can get western made jets.
Wings are bolted onto the fuselage.
They can also be removed for transport - or to replace a battle damaged wing with an intact spare.
By the way, did you also know that your car also comes in several different parts that can be disassembled?
That's part of why we retired them, they had to be maintained by Russian technicians (at NATO airbase), which has been less and less comfortable in recent years.
Now we are waiting for F-16s.
