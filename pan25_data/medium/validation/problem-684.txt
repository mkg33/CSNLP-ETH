June, the State Land Department has leased state trust land to the Saudi-owned Fondomonte corporation for $25 per acre, so that the Saudi company could grow alfalfa and send it back to Saudi Arabia to feed that country’s cows.
More unbelievably, the state is allowing this company to pump groundwater for free.
The $25/acre land lease is well below market rates, and the water being given away comes from the Butler Valley Basin and Vicksburg – areas that Arizona cities may very well need to rely on for their water needs in the near future.
It's not just giving them free groundwater to grow alfalfa in 110 degree deserts--the groundwater they're pumping is Phoenix's strategic water reserve.
Once that's gone, the city goes with it.
Well, sort of.
There are a lot of misconceptions about alfalfa.
A lot of articles like to paint alfalfa as "water thirsty" and cite stats on water usage per acre per year.
But what they fail to take into account is that in places with long growing seasons like AZ and CA, they're typically getting 8 to 10 cuts (harvests) per year.
Alfalfa itself has a very deep taproot, over 20 feet in many cases, and is actually quite drought tolerant.
It's just that with the right soil moisture it grows very quickly and you can maximize yield by irrigating.

My pleasure!
I didn't really think anyone would be interested, tbh, so I didn't give a ton of info but here's a little more.
Of course the problem is that Arizona is not colorado.
And obviously alfalfa is more generally farmed these days using minimal water.
The Saudis are overusing water to get more cuts, juicier alfalfa.
That matters because the larger leaves are the favorite part.
Alfalfa as a plant doesn't require much water to survive.
But it's a perennial so once it's established most of your investment has been made.
Your fixed costs are the same whether you're doing 1 cut or 10, so as you maximize cuts you maximize profit.
Which means it's worth irrigating.
I'm not sure about AZ, but in my region of Colorado where we get 14" of precipitation per year, there are old fields that still have alfalfa growing after decades of not being irrigated.
It's actually a really cool plant.
Yes, exactly.
The caveat is that "good" will be subjective and dependent on the exact location.
Here in Colorado, on average, two of our three annual cuts are unirrigated.
In AZ it's probably closer to 100% irrigated so it will end up being more water per cut there.
One of the reasons it's such a popular crop here in CO is that it grows well in a wide range of soils, especially the difficult clays where I am.
Many farmers here don't have much water in storage (reservoirs) and are limited to irrigating during spring and early summer snowmelt.
So they irrigate when their ditch is in priority, grow as much as they can, and then by late summer they're out of water but the alfalfa survives and even thrives in the summer heat.
It's far less fertilizer-intensive than most crops; as a legume, it actually fixes nitrogen from the air.
It's a high-protein forage for animals.
It has a pretty purple flower and the pollinators go absolutely nuts for it.
When grown in a field with grass hay, a 25% mix of alfalfa can actually increase productivity of the field by 300%.
This is not only because it fixes nitrogen that the grass needs, but because alfalfa grows back so quickly after cutting that it shades the soil, resulting in less evaporation from the top couple inches of soil, allowing more available moisture for the grass.
You are now subscribed to alfalfa facts.
Edit: or as sarcosmonaut brilliantly coined them, "alfalfacts" lol.
