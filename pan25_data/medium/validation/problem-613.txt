Now that the Roman Coliseum has been renovated, we should bring back the Games!
Give the trafficker a net and a stun gun and see if they can prevail.
Let's treat endangered animals as being as important as people.
The deliberate killing of one is murder and those involved are in a conspiracy to murder.
Reckless endangerment or habitat destruction is manslaughter...
Send them to prison as murderers....
A depressing reminder: There are more tigers in Texas than are left in the wild.
Unfortunately, it seems those tigers might be the only hope of them not going extinct.
Our western values tend to put more value in animals than the rest of the world.
Funny thing, the rest of the world was there long before 'western values' and so were the vanishing flora and fauna.
It looks to be me far more like capitalism is commodifying, say, a tiger as being worth more dead as a commodity than alive and with an unrealisable value.
And that this is why they are being killed.
Yup, I'd hate to be an endangered animal with any culinary value...
It would be a recipe for, well, me...
I agree that there needs to be a values shift...
Frankly the WTO and World Bank should weight environmental considerations into their balance sheets before they send us all into a complete environmental collapse.
There's a huge argument that 'campfire conservation', where third world communities see the value of preserving endangered fauna for western tourists to bring their western money in, has and does preserve them from being killed.
Western values is really nothing more than having the luxury of being able to care for an animal that has no direct benefit on someone's life...
I agree with everything you said, but I'd still argue that the western world values animals and the environment much more than the rest of the world.
It has become a very western thing to be outraged over the environment and extinctions.
Wealth surely plays a part, but there are first world Asian countries that just aren't on the same page as the rest of us.
Those tigers are not wild tigers, they won't survive in the wild a day because they are spoon fed.
And Western culture is about having exotic pets and not actually providing conservation to those tigers.
There are factories who are breeding them to sell rich people.
