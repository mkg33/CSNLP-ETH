I think it’s a good thing and people in every state should think about, let people be who they want to be, but don’t give them privileges that other groups don’t have.
Children should be sheltered from this type of stuff they’re like sponges absorbing everything that’s being thrown at them, you’re frontal lobes aren’t fully formed until roughly 25 years old.
I would hate for these children/adults are being fed this stuff only to think they want hormonal blockers/surgery only to realize things didn’t get much better.
The suicide rate is the same as those post surgery/blockers.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
