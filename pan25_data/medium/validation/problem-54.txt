Seems like we don't need to define those terms.
An AI that is better than humans at a wide range of tasks, can improve itself, and act without prompts would basically be indistinguishable from an AGI with consciousness and agency.
I always felt like Deus Ex was a great representation of a future I could really see happening.
Especially when it comes down to the people and politics.
Very weird and interesting to see it reflected back, I wonder how close weâ€™ll get.
I remember playing Deux Ex human revolution.
The news anchor, Eliza Cassan turns out to be generated AI that was create to put a spin on the for Illuminati.
Really intriguing to see such technology come to fruition.
But unlike the deepfakes, she was an actual AI which had awareness.
For us it's still 20-30 years before we get to that point.
With the explosive progress (and investment) even in the past couple years in AI, honestly I wouldn't be surprised if 20 years is a significant overestimation.
AIs that can handle multiple domains of tasks have existed for half a decade at least, AIs that can generate art, or writing, better than humans (or seeming to be by a human) already exist, AIs are better at games, diagnosing cancer, identifying sexuality by looking at faces, and so much more than humans.
