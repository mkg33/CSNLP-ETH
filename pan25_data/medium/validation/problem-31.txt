They are trying to strap chairs on them, it may come handy latter in case the supreme leader and the clerics have to leave in a hurry.
For all those less in the know, all ballistic missiles beyond a certain range, are hypersonic due to their exoatmospheric flight which allows them to easily accelerate without any interruption.
In the context of hypersonic weapons development, this is meaningless, because the goal is to achieve a hypersonic weapon that can maneuver and still retain that speed.
A ballistic missile can only do certain, very limited maneuvers, and many types cannot maneuver at all.
While it isn't easy, the engineering is not beyond a team of smart engineers.
Iran has enough education that I there is no reason to think this is beyond their engineering abilities.
You can argue that those engineers could have done something more useful with their time, but not that they don't have the ability to design it from scratch.
For me, it's less about Iranian engineers capabilities, and more of the fact that such a hypersonic ballistic missile was touted by Russia not too long ago.
And now we see Russa using Iranian drones in Ukraine.
And Iran suddenly announce it has the technology that Russia was bragging about 1-2 years ago.
Maybe they tried to acquire some human rights in exchange for their drones, but their buyer was fresh out of human rights and only had hypersonic missiles to give instead.
Supply and demand.
I, for one, put this entire thing on Adam Smith.
