If I remember correctly, we had a president try to fix this problem, but the opposing political party fought him on every step of the process because they didn’t like him.
1) I call hyperbole on the claim that we can set up a military base in a couple of days.
We can do things like that in months or maybe weeks (assuming that we already have rights to the land on which it's gonna sit), but a big base is a big undertaking.
This is a huge number of people, tough to wrap our minds around.
You mention thousands of troops, but we're looking at over 5k migrants per DAY.
There's no base which can handle that many people so quickly.
It's purely impossible to expect we can house and feed upwards of a million migrants at once.
2) When we do set up a base, we leverage the labor of the people who are going to be housed there.
Our troops are able bodied adults that have had training in following orders, are literate and have skillsets that are documented and catelogued.
As a group, the migrants are nothing like that.
So we'd have to truck in (and temporarily house) our own troops just to get the "migrant base" constructed.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
The Trump wall had surveillance cameras and sensors throughout, but otherwise, I agree.
This is a party problem.
Both sides want the same outcome, but are too stubborn to cooperate.
The wall consists mostly of 18- to 30-foot steel bollards anchored in concrete.
The barriers also feature sensors, lights, cameras and parallel roads in some places.”.
“Before Biden stopped new construction on the wall, the Trump administration had built 458 miles of what it dubbed “border wall system,” according to final figures compiled by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and provided to U.S. News.
Feel free to tunnel-vision on definitions if you like, but your original argument is still wrong.
The Trump administration did make efforts to increase surveillance along the border, as well as improving the wall in places where it was ineffective.
