Tactical local importance.
Russia pushed into Soledar because it was the one weak spot they could find "around" Bakhmut.
Still it's not much of an advantage because it just meanders the front line more, it doesn't push it closer to Bakhmut or cut any supply lines towards it.
What is the geographical or military significance of the salt mine?
Are they best to bunker down because they are underground?
Wouldn't encircling the mine starve out the occupiers?
Russian soldiers are under supported and have almost no rations or local support.
They'd just waste away quite fast and surrender since it's not their home country.
First time Russians went into Soledar they were attacked by Ukrainean forces that had retreated into the tunnels.
Now the Russians are trying to take the tunnels in order to secure against such a possible counterattack in the future.
Salt mine tunnels run for hundreds of km and Russians are paranoid that they might even lead behind their lines so now they pump in more men trying to secure the area while the offensive to the south, around Bakhmut proper, is more or less halted.
