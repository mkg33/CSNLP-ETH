I wonder how exposed India's pension funds and banks are to Adani Group.
This might be a financial crisis in the making.
Even before this sell off there are already articles saying the Adani group are over leveraged.
Their biggest state bank and LIC (Government Insurance/Life policy) invested heavily in Adani group.
Adani group is just handful of companies along with Tata and Ambani that you would consider "Too Big to Fail" that can tank a portion of the country's economy by itself.
Adani "too big to fail" is a thing that both left wing and right wing want to peddle for their own reason.
But anyone sensible can see that Adani is mostly hot air, the promoters own much of the stock and whatever valuable assets they own - ports etc - won't lose their value if Adani fails.
LIC and State bank are nowhere near as exposed as both sides are claiming - one side to criticize the government and the other side to force a bail out of Adani.
LIC invested way back.
They have 0.9% of their funds in Adani and pretty sure they have got decent returns even after all the shitshow because of how low they purchased in the first place.
2 yrs later Adani would be at 4k levels again.
The assets are gold mines to be honest and if things turn good and they start investing in green hydrogen along with Reliance it will be a turn around for the entire country.
