All of these people in LCOL red states are big mad that Californians and New Yorkers are moving to their states, outbidding them on houses and services, but none of them ever stop and consider why all these people from blue states are so much better off than them in the first place.
oh dont worry they will be quick to explain exactly how its different because they aren't entitled.
they just deserve it.
they just do.
Did you see that video from the 80s that surfaced, interviewing about the new drinking and driving laws?
Apparently no drinking and driving is communism and having to wear a seatbelt is communism.
I'd imagine the majority of the ones leaving are republicans.
It doesn't matter though, red or blue, they all benefited from the same Californian policies.
I can only speak from myself, but what entices me to move to a LCOL state is low/no state income tax, being able to buy a McMansion for a fraction of what I could sell my small house for, and everything being relatively cheaper and generally being better off than most of the people around me.
The thought of being able to live like a king somewhere is really attractive whereas I'm only comfortably middle class here.
What keeps me here is my first hand experience how much easier it is to succeed in an HCOL area and wanting my children to have that advantage.
Blue policies typically focus on wealth creation where as red policies focus on wealth preservation.
Jobs have typically tethered people who benefit from wealth creation policies to the places that enact those policies, but with the rise in remote work, people like me who've benefited from these policies can leave and not pay back into them and take advantage of the disparities between them and people in LCOL areas.
