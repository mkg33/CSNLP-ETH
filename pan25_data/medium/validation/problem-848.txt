> Farideh Moradkhani has been arrested by the regime before.
She was arrested on January 13 while on her way home.
Following her arrest Iranian security reportedly searched Moradkhaniâ€™s house and seized some of her belongings, according to human rights organizations.
For the record, familial "honour" killings are not particularly common in Iran and are much more prevalent in South Asia and the Arab world.
That being said, the Iranian regime have no isue with killing people who oppose them.
Honour doesn't come into that equation.
Thanks for doing this.
Even I skipped the article after the first paragraph just to check if she is the niece of the Supreme Leader of Iranian regime.
It's all about perspective.
From theirs, everything they've been tought and believe, tells them this is the right and just thing to do, perhaps the only thing to do, or else they don't deserve their position of power.
This is all hypothetically from his perspective, obviously.
It's twisted from ours, but from his it's just like dealing with any other traitor.
It's easy to justify basically anything if you think god is on your side.
Not for their hairstyles.
He couldn't care less about their hair styles.
It's the headwear he loses his shit over.
Also, he hasn't murdered anyone.
He gets other people to do his dirty work for him, which is much worse in my opinion.
