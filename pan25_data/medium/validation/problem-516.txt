Germany's armies (East and West) were still mostly rebuilt by former Wehrmacht officers.
In West Germany, they still had the same people who wrote the Nuremberg Laws working in government until the 1960s (they left when they retired from old age, they weren't even kicked out).
The West German intelligence agency was founded by Nazis.
Former East Germany today is where the AfD and NPD get the bulk of their votes.
Denazification was abandoned as policy pretty early on when the occupiers realized that the Nazi generation simply wasn't "buying it" (many Germans saw it as Victor's Justice, Allied hypocrisy, etc.)
and the real denazification of Germany only happened when that generation died out from being old and were replaced by their children and grandkids.
Weren't there tons of stipulations on nations accepting the Marhshall Plan aid regarding their defense capabilities?
That would appeal mainly to nations that were truly obliterated.
While Russia appears to be losing this thing, domestically they may be fucked, but not post WWII Japan/Germany levels of fucked.
