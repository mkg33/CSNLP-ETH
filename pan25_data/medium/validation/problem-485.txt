It's exactly the situation that spawned the Rwandan genocide: after Tutsi rebels killed the Rwandan president, the Hutu systematically massacred the Tutsi population.
I am not going to defend the actions of the individual terrorists who attack Israel, but simultaneously you have to wonder if any group of people would be behaving differently in their shoes?
Their rights have been stripped, the international courts won't help, their neighboring Muslim countries won't help, except for Iran who will give them weapons to fight as a proxy against the people who are slowly driving them from their ancestral homeland.
(Don't retaliate against an entire nation for the actions of a group, or in this case, a gunman.
In the words of Dana White : "That's fucking illegal").
There has been too much retaliation and injustice by both sides.
Someone has to break the chain.
Two people get murdered, so several dozen are about to die, so more people will be murdered.
The Palestinians think that the Israeli goal is to exterminate every single one of them, a belief which the Israeli government never seems to work too hard to disabuse them of.
I don't think Israel is unjustified in their desire for security either.
However, it's hard to be sympathetic when the other side throws a rock so you fire back with a tank.
They fire an RPG, so you launch an MLRS salvo.
Somebody has to make the move to break this cycle of violence, and I don't think it's reasonable to expect it to be the most desperate party.
Hear me out, this won't be popular but Zionists didn't ignite the conflict.
This UN fucked up by essentially taking land from a country and is too afraid to admit they did trying to cover it up with a two state solution like you would cover a turd with glitter.
