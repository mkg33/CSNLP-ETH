>The Chairman of the Brest City Executive Committee in Belarus, Alexander Rogachuk, announced on Telegram that the troops are advancing as soon as possible.
Those are usually pointed at some corporate intranet page with links to the timesheeting and leave systems, service desk, latest rah-rah from the CEO about mission statements, etc.
Also, there are often two headlines for the same article.
One which is shown on article pages itself as well as the news site's own home page for SEO (search engine optimisation) purposes, and another published to third party sites like Facebook and news reader apps that are intended more to get someone to click the link.
Little known fact, almost all reporters do not write their headlines.
That job is left to the editors.
The Daily Beast is the digital version of a rag, so I'm not surprised the editors aren't great.
That and they intentionally leave it vague, so you click into the article.
Putin is stupid and his criminal invasion of Ukraine proved it.
But his "nukes" are delicate beasts that have not been properly maintained and most of them don't work.
So if Putin launches one - or several - and they fail to detonate, that will prove Russia's nuclear weakness to the entire world.
Some other neighbors of Russia, like China, would be very interested to know about that.
And so Putin's decisions have to be guided not by rational intellect, but by an instinct for survival.
And that's what keeps him from using nukes.
