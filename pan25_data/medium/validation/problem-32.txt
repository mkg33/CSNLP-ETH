While i wish this was true, it probebly isn't.
the public has a short attention span, and once a distraction is found people will stop showing up to those protests.
People didn't stop protesting the government during the COVID lockdowns even when the government was actively trying to suppress them.
There will always be a small core that will be vigilant and continue protesting, but the majority of people move on to the next thing quite easily.
iirc even during covid lockdowns the protests slowly diminished.
Consider this though.
I've been attending the demonstrations in Haifa since the Balfour protests during the lockdowns, then in the rallys leading up to the elections, and have never seen more than a few hundreds of people there.
Last week I was in the Tel Aviv rally but I understand there were something like 1500 people demonstrating in Haifa.
Today there were 7000 or 8000 people there.
This is big.
This is half of all Israelis trying as hard as we can to say no to racism, bigotry, theocracy and corruption.
Calling it "judicial reforms" is a joke.
Basically, it's Netanyahu's plan to change Israel's government system, remove almost all checks and balances, crash minorities, abolish basic human rights and turn the country into a non-democracy.
I couldn't come to the big protest in Tel Aviv this week, I went to a smaller protest in Haifa (ca.
7000 people), but I protested in Tel Aviv last week (ca.
80,000) and will go next week and then the week after that, because if I don't, I might as well give up on everything I have ever held dear.
I know and i wasnt attacking you , sorry if it was understood that way .
Its important though that when people see this they will know what it really is , thats why i commented .
My patents were there.
I went with my kids to meet them and my father told me it was the first demonstration he ever attended in his entire life.
And that they intend to keep coming every week.
