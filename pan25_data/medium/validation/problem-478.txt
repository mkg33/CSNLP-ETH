Bill Mahar actually did a multi point analysis on current GOP criteria.
Ronnie these days wouldn’t be allowed in the party due to things like bipartisan initiatives and raising taxes multiple times etc.
If Reagan were still in the picture and cognitively with it, Trump would be like Vader and Reagan would be Palpatine.
I don’t think he’d ever get behind Trump as a follower, he’d be the one pulling all the strings.
Reagan was as big a pig as Trump.
He was just smart enough to know he needed to surround himself with competent people and to let them do their jobs.

Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Here's my take.
Trump has changed the rules.
GOPs used to fight, but then come together at election time.
Trump only cares about Trump.
If he can pull 10% of the vote away from the Party, the Dems could actually have a supermajority and pass some much needed laws.
So, right after the 2016 election, there was a panel discussion; they brought in the creators of all the political TV dramas.
All of the writers and producers agreed on one thing.
If a show like 'West Wing' or 'House Of Cards' had a character say half the things Trump had actually said, the networks and advertisers would have demanded that character be thrown off the show in humiliation.
I live in NY and that's what pretty much everyone I know thought, that Trump was just running a scam.
According to reports, he was as surprised as anyone when he won.
Remember that Melania used his win to blackmail him; she refused to leave NYC until he gave her a better pre-nup.
