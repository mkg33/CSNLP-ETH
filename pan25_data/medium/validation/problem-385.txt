Greeks are well aware of these threats and have an extensive AA system as well as a huge fleet of recently upgraded F-16's, many Mirage 2000's, and has recently put in orders for new F-35's and Rafale's.
Greece could trivially hold off Turkish fighters and shoot down its ballistic missiles using its Patriot batteries or sole S-300 system in Crete until NATO mobilized against it which would be suicide for the Erdogan regime.
A Turkey-NATO war would result in hundreds of thousand, if not millions, of Turks dead, its infrastructure and economy destroyed, and its military defeated and its leaders in the Hague in weeks, if not days.
Turkey is far too dangerous and its people and leadership far too radicalized to left alone and would be kept as a heavily sanctioned Western vassal state like West Germany for decades if not generations.
Erdogan plays up a madman, but is otherwise pragmatic and looks out only for himself, like all dictators.
you think the military wouldnâ€™t die before it let the mother state take over forcefully?
I can only imagine the chaos.
Look at Incirlik on a map.
If the U.S. ever tried to attack Turkish forces from there then they'd never get an aircraft more than 500 feet off the ground before being shot down by Turkish forces, assuming they could even launch anything before the Turkish military rolled in and took full control.
