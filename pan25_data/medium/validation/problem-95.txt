Honestly, we're gonna get fucked either way now.
Let's pray right decisions will be made, but this shit isn't going to be left unpunished.
Russia is gonna get it somehow and they'll see it as provocation, or China will think it's too weak and fuck with Taiwan more.
Either way, lose-lose.
It could be false flag, or defence system shooting down a cruise missile, stray / out of controle missiles by either party.
At the beginning of the Russian Invasion, all the Baltic states used article 4, article 4 is a convention of all the NATO members to determine a defense plan for the member who invoked the article 4, this doesnt mean war, it means that there is a defense concern and they want it on NATOs mind in a way.
Some of the results of Article 4 invocation includes Given the likelihood of this being an accident, I can see NATO agreeing to step up air defense in Poland and provide more missile defense systems to Ukraine.
Debries would probably fuck with their own satalites and prevent any form of space travel.
Until we clean that up, invent energy shield or we just accept space is off limits forever.
