Former President Donald Trump’s copyright claim in a lawsuit against author Bob Woodward faces several major obstacles while touching on unsettled questions about intellectual property rights over recorded interviews.
Trump’s litigation against Woodward, his publisher Simon & Schuster Inc., and its parent Paramount Global targeted the release of audio recordings of 2019 and 2020 interviews without permission.
He’s demanding $50 million and seeking a court order declaring that his responses are creative expressions that grant him sole authorship over the recordings, a copyright that would extend to derivative works such as Woodward’s audiobook, “The Trump Tapes: Bob Woodward’s Twenty Interviews with President Donald Trump.”.
That copyright claim could sink on several grounds, according to copyright lawyers who largely regard the claim—on the whole—as frivolous.
Intuition suggests to many that an interviewee has no expectation of being able to prevent an interviewer from using their responses.
Filing frivolous lawsuits to cause his detractors to incur legal fees and to attract attention is, of course, a Trump tradition.
When he sued biographer Timothy O'Brien in 2006, he repeatedly claimed that his intent was to bankrupt him.
His publisher, Warner Books, paid all of his legal fees.
This should have been enough for his case to be thrown out and for a countersuit, but we live in an America where the only thing that matters is who has the most money.
