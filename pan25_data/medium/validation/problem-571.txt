to be fair to India, Russia is very open to outsourcing the manufacturing and even design to India which is the whole relation.
Russia still has a level of manufacturing which in some aspects surpasses china (who hasn't been able to get turbine designs and manufacturing off the ground).
listen, if India thought small then they would have already surpassed china in fields besides raw numbers.
they always think big.
and tend to pay long term because of that.
Unified Indian Statehood is as recent as the mughal, with them being third or fourth to achieve that in the 5000 years that India has had civilization.
the Raj wasn't that unified, being kept together by force from outside power.
and the modern Indian state is mostly the Hindu majority area of the Raj.
I am going over history because India as seen today is very much a "thinking big" achievement.
i'm implying India's biggest challenge is that they ignore the details, the small things, the discomforts that when stretched to a billion people become crippling.
and that is before we address the wealth gap that industrialization is creating, where India is creating billionaires every year but the people still remain materially well, bad is too nice.
i hope it improves but... well.
I.E.
India sees the desperation, sees Russia trying to sell their technology to even NATO members and realize that if they get that tech it can give their defense and eventually aerospace industry a leap start compared to both china and the UK.
not to mention the potential of capturing former Russian markets that china can't due to differences between the defense standards of china (designed from the ground up) or the west (due to price and lack of experience with said machinery).
Well part of the reason they are open to outsourcing is they can't get any of the components they need sent to Russia and are hoping India can evade those sanctions.
The other reason is the folks running the plants in Russia steal everything that isn't nailed down.
They are probably hoping Indian companies steal less than Russian ones........
