Portugal and Netherlands are decriminalized, like many other countries with varying degrees of tolerance.
In the netherlands it happens under huge gray area, because growing and transporting weed is illegal but selling it isnâ€™t.
So how does it reach the coffeeshops?
Magic I guess.
Okay thank you!
I didn't mention those countries with confidence because I remembered being corrected before in a conversation about the Netherlands.
It's the same in Uruguay as far as selling goes (at least last time I was there).
You can grow and smoke in Uruguay no problem but selling is illegal.
Not legal in Portugal, just decriminalized together with all drugs.
Not legal in the Netherlands either, but they've had a policy of not prosecuting stores who follow certain guidelines while selling it.
Growing and selling within social clubs is legal in Malta and also sort of legal the same way in Spain, but just due to the constitution leaving a sort of loophole and not because it's explicitly legalized like in Malta (at least not by the national goverment).
Use in private is legal in South Africa, but selling and buying is not even though there are public stores for people who want it without needing any sort of connections at all.
